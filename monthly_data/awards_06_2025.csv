Participating students conduct research at Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago, Chile, developing skills in qualitative data collection, multi-disciplinary collaboration, problem-solving, and systems thinking and modeling to analyze complex socio-technical systems. Students work closely with local faculty mentors, engage in cultural exchange, and contribute to innovative research focused on how housing policies and practices can better meet community needs through a systems-based approach. By fostering connections with housing experts and planners in both Chile and the U.S., the program supports shared learning and cross-cultural dialogue, generating insights that can help housing authorities in both countries, and globally, develop more effective and systemic solutions to urban housing challenges.<br/><br/>The global shortage of affordable urban housing is a complex, systemic issue driven by factors such as limited land availability, inadequate infrastructure, restrictive zoning, gentrification, and financing barriers. Despite growing awareness of these challenges, a significant gap remains in research and practice that models the interconnected social, environmental, economic, and technical factors influencing urban housing outcomes. To address this gap, the UHS IRES program provides civil engineering and urban studies students with essential skills in qualitative research design, systems thinking, cross-cultural collaboration, and stakeholder engagement through participation in mixed-methods research in Santiago, Chile. As part of the program, students working in multidisciplinary teams analyze case studies reflecting three distinct urban housing approaches, contributing to a broader understanding of effective housing policies and practices worldwide. Through a phased research design - impact assessment, systems modeling, and leverage point identification - U.S. students collaborate with faculty at Universidad Diego Portales to develop socio-technical systems models based on these case studies. The program's research approach combines qualitative data with network analysis, participatory systems modeling, and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to rigorously identify leverage points for improving urban housing outcomes. By combining engineering, social science, and architectural perspectives, the research provides valuable insights to shape impactful policy recommendations. Collaborations with urban housing planners in Chile and the U.S. promote shared learning and meaningful dialogue. A multi-phase external evaluation - comprising feedback, post-program surveys, and a follow-up Zoom focus group assesses students' growth in research skills, collaboration, urban housing expertise, and the UHS IRES program's long-term impact on their educational and career trajectories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To study viruses, the viral genomics community has generated enormous amounts of scientific data through advanced gene sequencing and other techniques. Exploring and extracting scientific insights from data of this size is challenging and requires accessible training  that can teach the research community how to use the advanced computational tools and infrastructure needed for research. At the same time, the rapid development of novel algorithms and Artificial Intelligence-driven methods for analyzing this data outpaces current training opportunities, both for scientists who use computational infrastructure and for the research computing professionals who design and maintain these systems. A critical gap exists in equipping both groups with practical skills to leverage shared, high-performance computing systems and integrate reproducible scientific processes into the nation's advanced research computing frameworks. By helping scientists use cutting-edge, AI-driven tools to understand viruses better, this project promotes the progress of scientific understanding of viruses, their interactions with their hosts, and their effects on biological systems.  The broader impacts of this research support public health, environmental understanding, and national preparedness. This work also builds a stronger research community by making training accessible to a broad range of scientists and students.<br/><br/><br/>The iVirus Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Training Initiative will develop six modular, self-paced, online training resources to enable effective use and development of scalable pipelines in NSF-supported CI ecosystems. The training modules will be designed around the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) software, emphasizing interactive learning, reproducibility, evolvability, and sustainable design. The modules will be open-source, portable across CI platforms, and designed to meet the diverse needs of researchers and developers working in viral ecology.

To study viruses, the viral genomics community has generated enormous amounts of scientific data through advanced gene sequencing and other techniques. Exploring and extracting scientific insights from data of this size is challenging and requires accessible training  that can teach the research community how to use the advanced computational tools and infrastructure needed for research. At the same time, the rapid development of novel algorithms and Artificial Intelligence-driven methods for analyzing this data outpaces current training opportunities, both for scientists who use computational infrastructure and for the research computing professionals who design and maintain these systems. A critical gap exists in equipping both groups with practical skills to leverage shared, high-performance computing systems and integrate reproducible scientific processes into the nation's advanced research computing frameworks. By helping scientists use cutting-edge, AI-driven tools to understand viruses better, this project promotes the progress of scientific understanding of viruses, their interactions with their hosts, and their effects on biological systems.  The broader impacts of this research support public health, environmental understanding, and national preparedness. This work also builds a stronger research community by making training accessible to a broad range of scientists and students.<br/><br/><br/>The iVirus Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Training Initiative will develop six modular, self-paced, online training resources to enable effective use and development of scalable pipelines in NSF-supported CI ecosystems. The training modules will be designed around the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) software, emphasizing interactive learning, reproducibility, evolvability, and sustainable design. The modules will be open-source, portable across CI platforms, and designed to meet the diverse needs of researchers and developers working in viral ecology. Training content will be developed through a unified pipeline that includes (1) interactive instructional design, (2) modular training components, (3) expert input and curated test datasets, and (4) community engagement and dissemination.

This project will take a new approach toward remediating PFAS by engineering special enzymes that can degrade these stable chemical bonds. If successful, the outcomes of the project could unlock exciting technologies for carbon-fluorine bond destruction, saving money and protecting human health and the environment. Long-term application of the enzymes could break down fluorinated chemicals in soil, drinking water, groundwater, biosolids produced from wastewater sludge, and industrial waste streams. Undergraduates will gain experience as part of the research team. <br/><br/>Fluorinated organics, like perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), are common industrial additives which persist in the environment and have limited, expensive, and energy-intensive destruction technologies. So far, efforts to degrade PFCAs enzymatically have stalled, due to strong C-F bonds and a lack of evolutionary pressure to reward their destruction. As a result, PFCAs and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly contaminating environmental media and require removal. Therefore, there is a critical need for new techniques to identify and enhance enzymatic defluorination mechanisms. This project adopts a new approach to discover and improve enzymatic defluorination, positing that proper evolutionary incentive and high-throughput screening techniques can create and discover biocatalysts that degrade perfluorinated carbon chains. The new approach uses a genetic circuit that links survival with defluorination to engineer defluorinases to degrade new substrates. Di- and tri-fluoroacetate will be targeted initially and later the substrate scope will be expanded to include PFCAs. The research will advance fundamental knowledge about enzymatic defluorination by uncovering beneficial mutations in catalytic proteins at the amino acid level, and, thereby, tunable mechanisms to enhance the desired reactions.

This project creates open instructional materials and trains thousands of learners in physics-based ""Digital Twin"" technologies, enabling engineers, scientists, and students to design and test robots through computer simulation before hardware is built. By lowering cost and risk, simulation accelerates innovation and discovery, strengthens U.S. leadership in advanced manufacturing and space technology, and expands economic opportunity. A key feature of the project is its anyone-anywhere-anytime approach to learning and training, that hones the modeling and simulation skills of participants ranging from California State University students to experts at NASA, Department of Energy, and other government agencies. The project's long-term impact is a workforce fluent in robotics simulation, Digital Twin technologies, and high-performance computing that gains hands-on experience with the open-source Chrono simulator, positioning these professionals to advance national prosperity and public welfare.<br/><br/>This project executes a CyberTraining plan focused on enabling the use of Digital Twins in Robotics through two coordinated activities: (i) creating instructional material, and (ii) delivering a CyberTraining (CT) program. For (i), this project provides the opportunity to carry out an instructional-material tokenization process and flipping of three Chrono-enabled or Chrono-related classes; prepare Jupyter notebooks for self-paced training; and produce new widely available Chrono models and documentation that encourage CI tool use through smoother onboarding. For (ii), this team will facilitate CyberTraining via both synchronous and asynchronous instructional approaches. These ""create content and execute training"" activities will anchor a technical effort that has five CyberTraining components. The first CT component expands participation in computational science through a collaboration between project investigators from the University of Wisconsin?Madison (UW?Madison) and the California State University (CSU) System. Every 12 months, a cohort of students from four CSU campuses ? Los Angeles, Northridge, Fullerton, and Pomona ? will be trained in using simulation in lunar exploration robotics. These activities include a visit to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for a firsthand look at rover operations; online training on simulation use in robotics; and a two-week Summer School at UW?Madison that concludes with a robotics team competition. The second CT component will train practitioners in the use of Chrono via tutorials held in conjunction with an annual consortium meeting that fosters outreach to industry. The project also includes revamping three UW?Madison courses that underpin the concept of Digital Twins in robotics. The fourth CT component provides asynchronous training to thousands of anonymous Chrono users. This training draws on materials uploaded to the NSF's ACCESS ecosystem and the Project Chrono website and is further supported by a large language model expert agent piloted by this group. Lastly, the project engages students participating in NASA's Lunar Autonomy Challenge. Together, these activities create a scalable, reproducible pipeline that couples flipped-classroom pedagogy, cloud-ready software containers, and software-in-the-loop testbeds. Expected outcomes of this project include a curated library of Digital Twin models, freely available training artifacts hosted on the NSF's ACCESS ecosystem, and a measurable increase in CI-savvy robotics researchers capable of executing large-scale simulation studies on high-performance computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some emerging systems use heart-based biometric signals, captured through photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors in these devices, to authenticate users continuously without requiring passwords or active interaction. This seamless, unobtrusive form of authentication can enhance both security and user experience. However, PPG-based continuous authentication also introduces new privacy and cybersecurity risks if attackers can fool the system. In particular, biometric systems can be subject to impersonation attacks, where an attacker tries to present signals that mimic a target user. This project explores the risks of presentation attacks in PPG-based biometric systems, in which an adversary captures a person's heart signals via video and replays a synthetic version tailored for a target device to impersonate the user. The project team also explores defense mechanisms that identify unique characteristics of signals from real human users that are difficult to reproduce synthetically. By examining this practical attack and developing a targeted defense, the research aims to reduce impersonation risks, build trust in biometric authentication, and support the broader adoption of PPG-based authentication systems in security-sensitive applications. The project also contributes to national priorities in cybersecurity, STEM education, and workforce development through student mentoring, curriculum integration, and outreach to local schools and communities.<br/><br/>This project examines the feasibility of presentation attacks on PPG-based continuous authentication systems used in mobile and wearable devices and develops practical methods for defending against it. The research includes four coordinated components. First, the investigators will study how cardiac signals can be acquired remotely using video-based remote PPG sensing under realistic, covert recording conditions. This component applies data-driven enhancement techniques to reduce the impacts of motion and lighting variation, improving signal quality for adversarial use. Second, the project will develop a deep learning framework to transform remotely captured signals into synthetic waveforms that closely resemble those generated by contact PPG sensors in the wearable and mobile devices. Domain adaptation techniques will be investigated to ensure the model generalizes across different device configurations while reducing retraining efforts. Third, the team will design a physical signal injection method that uses a controllable external light source, guided by a learned model of sensor response, to deliver spoofed signals to the target device's PPG sensor. This method is intended to operate without modifying the device's hardware or software, enabling a low-effort and covert attack pathway. Finally, the researchers will develop a hybrid liveness detection system that distinguishes genuine cardiac signals from synthetic ones by identifying subtle physiological features that are difficult to reproduce. Adaptive learning strategies will be incorporated to address natural variability in heart signals, enhancing detection reliability over time. Project outcomes will include curated datasets, hardware prototype designs, and educational resources to extend the project's impact to both academic and public audiences while supporting workforce development in cybersecurity and intelligent sensing technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, trust is key to their adoption. Overtrust can lead to complacency and accidents, fueling public skepticism and reducing confidence in automation. Undertrust results in disuse, preventing AVs from delivering their intended benefits. Miscalibrated trust remains a major barrier, particularly in partially automated systems where humans and automation share control in fluid and evolving ways. This raises a critical question: How does trust transfer between different degrees of automation? This project seeks to understand trust propagation across automation levels and driving contexts, ensuring trust is appropriately calibrated to support safe and effective human-automation interaction.<br/><br/>This project has three research aims: (1) to develop a framework for trust transfer across automation levels and driving contexts, (2) to estimate trust transferability based on human-machine interface (HMI) design, and (3) to build a dynamic computational model for trust using automation level activation, environmental context, and interface design. Trust transfer will be examined through survey studies, driving simulations, and computational modeling. The survey study will assess how trust propagates across automation levels and the role of environmental factors in this process. A driving simulation study will track real-time trust shifts using behavioral, physiological, and eye-tracking data, focusing on how HMI similarity influences trust transfer. These findings will inform the development of a computational model that quantifies trust adaptation over time. The model will be trained and validated with empirical data to ensure predictive accuracy, providing a foundation for designing adaptive human-machine interfaces that enhance trust calibration and automation usability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Touch complements other senses and is a critical part of a person?s ability to identify fine features, develop spatial awareness, learn, and form memories. Touch enables people to combine information across different senses and to form emotional experiences. However, most digital experiences have yet to include touch. This project will use a novel approach to enable images that combine sight and touch through detailed, dynamic, and rich haptic displays built from recently developed soft materials that significantly respond to changes in their settings. Including rich haptic experiences will transform human-computer interaction, much like the giant leap forward when computers began presenting graphics on screens. Enabling users to ""feel"" digital graphics has the potential to redefine experiences across a wide range of applications, including education, entertainment, and product design.  Haptic interfaces offer access to visual information when users must look elsewhere.  They also introduce interactions the combine touch with other senses to enhance tasks like operating machines from a distance, providing a person with the sense of being present elsewhere, and exploring complex scientific data or medical images.<br/><br/>A key hurdle that has prevented people from living in this multimedia digital world is the lack of actuation technology specifically designed for tactile haptics, thereby limiting the palette of haptic interactions available to designers. Most work which incorporates tactile haptics in computation use vibration motors, which do not take advantage of the wide range of possible sensations and receptors in people?s skin. This project will make use of the enormous amount of innovation that has occurred in stimuli-responsive soft materials, and create high-resolution, dynamic and rich tactile digital graphical content. The investigators will develop novel tactile haptic technologies for digital illustrations through an iterative process in which haptic perception tests and functional evaluations will inform materials specifications based on three main research objectives: (1) Identify the potential of stimuli-responsive soft materials to create haptic pixels to render black and white graphical information to users through touch. (2) Incorporating dynamic material response into tactile pixels to expand the capabilities of rendered graphical content. (3) Augmenting the richness of graphical content rendered for users through an increase of the dynamic mechanical capabilities of tactile pixels. Through this proposed work, the investigators will bridge the gap between materials, haptics, and human-computer interaction research to create new tactile digital expressions. These advances will enable and accelerate new user interfaces and interactions through this underutilized information channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, multi-robot systems play a critical role in our society, including industrial robots in car assembly lines, hundreds of drones in a light show, and many vehicles in future autonomous ride-sharing services. Sequential decision-making is crucial to construct functional, intelligent MAS that can meet our needs. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is an approach that facilitates machine learning through feedback that reinforces the desired behavior. However, this approach requires a quantitative reward function that is oftentimes unavailable or hard to design. Formal methods (FM), by nature, can accurately specify and verify software and hardware systems. This project aims to combine the two approaches in order to construct multi-agent systems that are more scalable, easier to understand, and safer. The investigators will also disseminate research findings, integrate them in teaching, and train graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project has the following three research objectives. Objective A develops novel specification-guided Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches that optimally decompose the specification and assign the resulting parts to agents. The principled and interpretable methods can learn a ?correct by construction? scheduler to decompose signal temporal logic specifications optimally, corresponding to the credit assignment in specification-guided MARL. Objective B aims to analyze and explain the emergent coordinated behaviors of MARL by mining specifications from the trajectory rollouts of the policies. An interaction graph in the MAS is first learned by graph neural networks, followed by a novel template-free, generative approach for specification mining in a hierarchical and scalable manner. Objective C aims to enable the transfer of MARL policies across a distribution of tasks by simultaneous specification inference and policy learning. A specification-guided meta MARL approach is developed based on approximate Bayesian inference. This work can lead to more scalable and robust autonomy in factories, warehouses, hospitals, and homes. Concrete examples include large-scale self-driving vehicles, off-road autonomy in the wild, and advanced air mobility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To bridge this gap, the investigators will focus on establishing mathematically rigorous methods for uncertainty quantification to build trustworthy AI. Applications will include enhancing theoretical guarantees and interpretability of neural networks, providing robust estimation and inference for econometric and biomedical studies, and detecting real-time change-points in high-dimensional time series data.

Accurately describing these traits is important for making correct diagnoses and choosing the right treatment. But clinicians currently write descriptions of these traits in loose, unstructured text, which can create confusion and inconsistency. Two doctors might describe the same condition in different ways, making it harder to communicate clearly and to keep documented data reliable. This lack of clarity has real effects on health. To diagnose problems like heart or brain disorders, doctors often watch how signals in the body, such as an EKG (electrocardiogram) or EEG (electroencephalogram), change over time. If these changing patterns are not clearly defined, it becomes harder to detect disease early, track its course, or plan treatments tailored to each patient. This project tackles this issue by creating a better way to describe phenotypes. This research builds a new logical system, called Ensemble Logic, that allows clinicians to describe these patterns in a way that is clear, consistent, and easy for computers to understand. This logical system is meant to be both intuitive and flexible. It will be used to define and detect complex health conditions using structured rules that help improve patient care and value in healthcare data.<br/><br/>This project has three main components: theoretical development to formulate Ensemble Logic and rigorously explore its expressive power and boundaries; translational work to convert the logic to practical tools usable by doctors and researchers; and experimental efforts using real brain signal data from epilepsy patients to test, refine, and validate these tools. If successful, this work will offer a robust, reliable way to describe dynamic biological signal patterns. It will support more precise diagnoses, enable better disease monitoring, and uncover new insights into how disorders present themselves. In the long term, this framework has the potential to help improve care for patients with epilepsy, heart conditions, and other complex diseases, while helping researchers extract meaningful patterns from large-scale health datasets. Ultimately, Ensemble Logic could serve as a foundational tool for analyzing a wide range of health data and for advancing research on human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computers are constantly vulnerable to malware, which can steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, or damage systems. Detecting and preventing malware is a significant challenge, and although recent advancements in deep learning have made it easier to identify potential malware threats, many deep learning models operate as ""black boxes"" that provide little information about how they work. This lack of information makes it hard to understand what about the software caused the model to flag it as malware or not. This in turn may make extra work for software developers who have to check legitimate software flagged as malware, or assess the risks posed by new, evolving malware that the models can?t yet detect. Therefore, improving the interpretability and reliability of malware detection systems is crucial to efficiently making software safer.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a robust framework for improving malware detection by identifying the key features learned by deep learning models, then generating new malware samples that might fool models with respect to those features. First, the project seeks to understand what features are learned and extracted by different neural network architectures, particularly those designed for image, sequence, and graph-based inputs. The goal is to gain insights into the representations and decision-making processes of various neural network models applied to diverse input domains. Second, the project explores whether new malicious binaries can be generated that evade detection models by strategically manipulating code based on the features used to identify malicious programs. This will involve developing techniques to create adversarial malware instances that can bypass current defense mechanisms. Third, the project will investigate how different binary rewriting techniques affect the performance of various neural network models. By analyzing the impact of these modifications, the study aims to improve the robustness of malware detection systems. To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based approach will be used to modify raw binary code in a way that allows it to evade detection by multiple deep learning models. Once adversarial malware is generated, the modified code will be analyzed to uncover patterns that distinguish different malware families and explain why certain modifications are successful in evading detection. Ultimately, the project will contribute to the broader field of malware analysis by openly sharing the malware dataset, techniques, source code, and generated adversarial datasets with the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Testing multi-threaded programs, where independent program tasks can execute concurrently and manipulate shared resources, remains challenging in practice since the sequence and ordering of interactions between multiple threads is hard to capture and replicate. This makes concurrency-related software bugs, called race conditions, very hard to detect and diagnose. If not identified proactively, concurrency bugs can manifest in production unexpectedly in disastrous ways, leading to potential human harm or loss of critical infrastructure. This project aims to develop principled techniques and tools for testing multi-threaded programs written in programming languages that depend on run-time management systems, such as, Java. Successful completion of this project will enable software engineers to perform reliable, efficient, and reproducible testing of large-scale concurrent applications to discover and eliminate race conditions. The project also includes synergistic educational activities, such as developing a debugging tool for novice programming classes and incorporating research findings into upper-division undergraduate computing courses.<br/><br/>This project will develop a controlled concurrency testing solution for multi-threaded programs running alongside managed runtimes (e.g., Java Virtual Machine code), which will: (a) ensure a correct and efficient mechanism for deterministically controlling the scheduling of thread interactions; (b) provide support for systematically or randomly exploring thread schedules using state-of-the-art search strategies based on probabilistic or partial-order-based algorithms in order to uncover hard-to-find concurrency bugs; and (c) work for arbitrary programs off-the-shelf in a push-button fashion. A key pillar of this project is to focus on general-purpose applicability as a primary objective for research on concurrency testing platforms, alongside the traditional goals of performance and search-space optimization. The project will also enable the large-scale evaluation of modern search algorithms across a wide variety of real-world software that powers production-scale distributed systems and web applications. The project will develop open-source tooling for use by software engineers as well as for educational purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participants will meet over a long weekend to learn about and disseminate important new developments in geometry and topology, with a special focus on symplectic geometry and adjacent areas. The Symplectothon will also make a concentrated effort to build the local regional network, by forging and strengthening in-person bonds and potential collaborations. Each Symplectothon workshop will focus on a specific emerging topic, and participants will typically consist of 20-30 graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and senior faculty from an array of institutions in the greater Southern California region. There will be one or two in-person invited experts and a similar number of virtual invited experts. Participants will stay together in a single dedicated location, and talks will be given by the participants, with plenary lectures by the invited experts. Each Symplectothon will also include several guided discussion and Q+A sessions, as well as a forward-looking talk on future directions by one of the invited experts. Outside of the intensive scientific programming schedule, participants will have ample time for open discussions, while building personal and professional ties through social activities such as collective cooking, hikes, and other outdoor activities.<br/><br/>The chosen topics for Symplectothon 2025 include Lagrangian fillings and cluster algebras. Participants will learn about Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian knots, cluster algebras, and microlocal sheaves, culminating in recent deep connections between these, particularly the work of Casals?Gao which establishes the existence of Legendrian knots with infinitely many distinct Lagrangian fillings and separately shows that every cluster seed in the augmentation variety arises from a Lagrangian filling. This is an exciting and interdisciplinary area under active development, and Symplectothon 2025 will be designed to bring Southern California geometers up to the research forefront. It will create an opportunity for researchers from different scientific backgrounds (i.e. symplectic geometry and cluster algebras) to convene and learn from each other. The participants will also learn about and discuss many other potential applications, such as the recent construction of cluster structures on braid varieties using ideas from symplectic topology, as well as many possible future connections between symplectic topology and cluster algebra. The tentatively chosen topic for Symplectothon 2026 is ""tropical curve counts beyond toric geometry"".

Despite concern over the impacts of a changing climate on aquatic ecosystems, some lakes and rivers are holding up surprisingly well.  The aquatic ecosystems of northern Mongolia represent one such ?bright spot.?  While air temperatures in the region have warmed almost three times faster than the global average, coldwater fish populations in northern Mongolia appear to be surprisingly robust.  This project builds on nearly 20 years of ecological research, monitoring, and sample collections to understand the factors underlying the resilience of Mongolia?s lakes, rivers, and fish populations.  Each summer, four undergraduate and four graduate students travel with American and Mongolian scientists to Lake Hovsgol and the Eg River in Mongolia to engage in research for six weeks.  Here, they conduct field ecology research projects in two-person grad-undergrad teams.  Student participants hone their research project proposals and outreach plans through a pre-trip distributed seminar and present results after the expedition at an online virtual symposium.<br/><br/>Student research teams investigate three broad hypotheses about the factors contributing to resilience of aquatic ecosystems.   First, via ?behavioral thermoregulation,? fish may be able to select microhabitats where temperatures remain more favorable to growth and survival.  Second, intra-specific variation in characteristics such as temperature tolerance may allow populations to persist in warming waters.  Third, changing ecological interactions, including predator-prey and host-parasite relationships, may either offset or exacerbate the direct effects of warming.  Experiments and observational studies test these hypotheses using cutting-edge tools such as DNA metabarcoding to investigate diets and microbiomes of endangered fishes, electronic tags to track fish movements, and data logging sensors to understand variation in the abiotic environment.  The Intellectual Merit of this project is centered on improving our understanding of the effects of a changing climate on natural ecosystems.  The Broader Impacts include improved management approaches for U.S. fisheries impacted by changes in climate and the training of 24 U.S. students in aquatic ecology research methods in an international setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Impredicativity captures expressive features of modern dependently typed languages, like induction-recursion, without further extension. Proof reuse is enabled by row types, used to describe extensible variants and extensible dependent records. Both object logics and constructs within them will be expressed extensible, automatically extending proof terms over simpler objects in smaller logics to apply to more complex terms in larger logics.

This reflexive and individualized approach to mentoring and advising will support students in successfully navigating their degree program to on-time graduation. The reflexive and holistic model will contribute to efforts to improve retention and graduation rates of all types of students as it provides a framework for addressing individual needs. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of academically talented, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are four specific objectives: (1) recruit and provide scholarships to 40 domestic, low-income, academically talented students in chemistry, forensic science, physics, and photonics; (2) retain scholars in the target majors (at least 85% retained to second year) and ensure on-time graduation (at least 50% graduate in 4 years); (3) match scholars to job opportunities or graduate programs; and (4) utilize formative feedback from scholars to iteratively improve programming and disseminate successful interventions. Many programs intended to support undergraduate STEM students focus on changing the student to succeed in the existing STEM system or provide enhanced student support in one area (i.e. advising and mentoring) without emphasis on other academic or social/emotional aspects of individual students. While institutions have established supports to increase student success, barriers to retention and on-time graduation remain. The project is a holistic approach that considers the needs of individual scholars by enhancing support holistically in advising, academics, as well as sense of belonging. This project will study the effectiveness of holistic advising and mentoring on low-income student success in terms of retention and 4-year graduation rates in the target majors. It will also explore how successful students (i.e. retained and graduated on time) value academic, cohort-building, and advising/mentoring support. This project will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach using institutional data as well as scholar feedback and reflections in surveys and interviews. Results of the project will be disseminated via conference presentations, journal articles, and workshops at national conferences as well as on the project website. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing flood risk and the damage it causes requires an integrated investigation across different disciplines, sectors, and international boundaries. The International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) Global Flood Resilience Program (GFRP) between the U.S. and South Korea serves the critical need for comprehensive research education programs. The GFRP Program is designed to develop U.S. students as researchers and practitioners to address complex flood-related problems both in the U.S. and globally. It also trains the next generation of problem solvers to have a comprehensive set of visions and tools to succeed. Each year, 10 U.S. students participate in a six-week international research experience: six students travel to Korea, while four participate in Texas, engaging with visiting Korean students from Pusan National University (PNU). The research products and collaboration model established by the PI team through successful international research and education projects with the Netherlands are leveraged and expanded to provide students with a wide range of international experiences. Key U.S. partners include Texas A&M Galveston (TAMUG: Yoonjeong Lee; Samuel Brody) and College Station (TAMU: Jens Figlus) campuses, and the Univ. of Puerto Rico Mayag?ez (UPRM: Ismael Pagán Trinidad). Korean partners are Pusan National University (PNU) and the University of Seoul (UOS).<br/><br/>Urban and coastal flooding issues in Korea and Texas are examined through problem- and place-based case studies using the flood resilience framework developed through a decade-long collaboration between the U.S. and the Netherlands. Specifically, locations in Seoul/Busan in Korea and Houston/Galveston in Texas act as focal points to integrate expertise in engineering (TAMU/UPRM), planning (TAMUG/PNU), and public policy (TAMUG/UOS) that guide student research. Transdisciplinary place-based analyses address the following overarching research questions: 1) What are the differences in the driving factors of flooding and its associated damage between the two countries? 2) Which flood mitigation measures are more suitable for each study area and why? Students conduct research covering both surge-based and precipitation-driven flood problems. The project assesses the effectiveness and applicability of the integrative flood resilience framework in a global context, leading to a better understanding of when and where to implement specific strategies to mitigate adverse flood impacts. The participants leverage U.S. and Korean data, methods, and facilities related to flood management to generate new knowledge on global flood resilience. The program prepares the next generation of U.S. engineers, scientists, and policymakers in academia and practice to tackle the societal problem of flooding innovatively on a global scale. Furthermore, the program generates data on specific educational methods to improve learning outcomes in problem- and place-based research settings, as well as on how to enhance international experiences for students. These findings contribute to improving future international research programs and are incorporated into teaching strategies across all partner institutions. Emphasis is placed on recruiting students from all U.S. collaborating institutions, with a focus on providing them opportunities to collaborate with international students and researchers through an innovative program design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As AI/ML systems, particularly those powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL), are increasingly used in personalized healthcare, education, commerce, and large language models, it is imperative to ensure these systems are reliable and ethical. This project aims to advance trustworthy RL by addressing the significant challenges of data privacy, robustness against corruption, and fairness across diverse user demographics. The project's broader significance lies in establishing fundamental connections between trustworthy RL and other machine learning areas, contributing to a comprehensive framework for responsible AI/ML development and deployment. Educational components include a ?no-regret? learning plan leveraging the principal investigator's popular blog, collaborations with industry through NSF centers and institutes, and a summer camp for local high school students. Ultimately, this project seeks to enhance scientific literacy, promote workforce development, inform public policy, and improve the responsible development and deployment of AI/ML technologies for societal benefit.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to investigate fundamental limits and algorithmic principles for trustworthy sequential decision-making. To this end, the project aims to develop a novel reduction from RL to statistical or online learning that integrates privacy, robustness, and fairness, enabling the leverage of established results in these better-understood domains. Specifically, the research focuses on four thrusts: (1) establishing the first theoretical results for private RL under general function approximations; (2) investigating the interplay between robustness (addressing data corruption and heavy tails) and privacy (considering both central and local differential privacy); (3) developing a novel framework for group fairness in RL based on constrained RL; and (4) applying this understanding to improve the alignment process of large language models. The research employs techniques from RL, stochastic optimization, online learning, information theory, and game theory to derive minimax lower bounds, develop general-purpose algorithms, and analyze the trade-offs between utility, privacy, robustness, and fairness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To bridge this gap, the investigators will focus on establishing mathematically rigorous methods for uncertainty quantification to build trustworthy AI. Applications will include enhancing theoretical guarantees and interpretability of neural networks, providing robust estimation and inference for econometric and biomedical studies, and detecting real-time change-points in high-dimensional time series data.

Traditional software debugging methods, centered around identifying and rectifying defects, fall short in addressing the unique nature of AI-software. This project seeks to develop novel, principled debugging techniques specifically designed to detect and resolve responsibility - that is, issues related to transparency, accountability, and impartiality - before AI-software is deployed publicly. The project also includes education-related activities, where results from the research will contribute to the computing curriculum expansion. <br/><br/>The project proposes the development and evaluation of a transformative debugging framework tailored to AI-software, which incorporates pre-trained deep neural networks and large language models during execution. At the core of this framework is the novel concept of metamorphic debugging, which explores the intersection of metamorphic testing - a method analyzing output variations caused by structured input changes - and relational verification across three dimensions: causality, information theory, and extreme value theory. Unlike conventional debugging, which inspects single program executions independently, metamorphic debugging simultaneously examines relationships across multiple program-runs to uncover nuanced requirement violations. The research will include creating methods for generating intuitive test cases sensitive to causal relationships, developing techniques for elucidating higher-order relations among multiple execution traces, and applying statistical approaches to rigorously assess worst-case scenarios for undetected defects. The framework's effectiveness will be routinely validated through integration into real-world AI-software, collaborations with industry partners, and surveys assessing student and developer perceptions of responsible AI-software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, cyber-physical systems including the Internet of Things involve interactions among devices, and social networks can be modeled as graphs capturing various relationships among people or groups. Other complex networks emerge in diverse engineering fields, such as power grids and transportation systems. Graph-based machine learning (ML) and signal processing algorithms exhibit well-documented performance in learning over graphs (LoG). Despite their success, the impact of these algorithms in real-world systems depends heavily on how ?socially responsible? they are. While graph-based ML models effectively integrate the nodal attributes with the topological information encoded by the graph, they also inherit and may even amplify potential unfairness. Using such models may subsequently result in unfair outcomes in decision- and policy-making in the related applications. While fairness issues have attracted increasing attention in general ML tasks, they are largely underexplored in the graph domain, especially in terms of theoretical analysis and fundamental understanding.

However, achieving both high speed and low latency can lead to a high bit error rate, which in turn reduces communication reliability. Thus, it is essential to develop a new error detection and correction coding solution that can tolerate communication errors in such scenarios. In communication systems, bit errors exhibit varying levels of semantic significance. Errors with low significance can be tolerated, while those with high significance must be corrected. This project will explore topological information from source data for error detection and correction in communication systems, which can ensure data fidelity at the topology level rather than the bit level, aiming to detect the significance of errors in the received data and correct them by recovering the original topological information. This approach offers new insights into communication errors and can potentially enable the development of novel codes for next-generation communication systems. In addition, this project will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students and will leverage outreach activities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to share research outcomes with K-12 students and teachers using specially developed educational modules. <br/><br/>In this project, topological data analysis, particularly persistent homology and persistence diagrams, will be used to extract and encode topological information from source data. The topological information captures high-level data relations, which can be more compact and semantically meaningful than bit-level relations.

To reach their full potential, next-generation XR systems demand a high degree of context awareness, that is, a detailed understanding of both user behaviors and surrounding environmental conditions. With enhanced context awareness, XR systems can deliver virtual content that is personalized, timely, and highly relevant, adapting to user interactions and responding to changes in the surrounding environments. To achieve this goal, this project builds a new class of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered XR systems that bring together the power of large language models (LLMs) and localized, context-rich knowledge databases to make XR systems more intelligent and adaptive. The project builds and maintains an accurate, up-to-date, and diverse knowledge database, which integrates diverse sources of contextual information, such as 3D object data, egocentric images, text inputs, and user-specific data like head pose, eye gaze, and user preferences. The project also makes context-aware XR more resource-efficient and low-latency, by strategically leveraging the collaboration of XR devices with nearby edge servers to process complex and dynamic contextual inputs. This project will lay the foundation for context-aware XR applications across multiple domains, such as commerce, entertainment, manufacturing, and social interactions. It will support a wide range of use cases, including smart homes, intelligent manufacturing, and collaborative social XR platforms, where systems can intelligently adapt to both individual and group user behaviors, as well as dynamic environmental conditions.

Addressing flood risk and the damage it causes requires an integrated investigation across different disciplines, sectors, and international boundaries. The International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) Global Flood Resilience Program (GFRP) between the U.S. and South Korea serves the critical need for comprehensive research education programs. The GFRP Program is designed to develop U.S. students as researchers and practitioners to address complex flood-related problems both in the U.S. and globally. It also trains the next generation of problem solvers to have a comprehensive set of visions and tools to succeed. Each year, 10 U.S. students participate in a six-week international research experience: six students travel to Korea, while four participate in Texas, engaging with visiting Korean students from Pusan National University (PNU). The research products and collaboration model established by the PI team through successful international research and education projects with the Netherlands are leveraged and expanded to provide students with a wide range of international experiences. Key U.S. partners include Texas A&M Galveston (TAMUG: Yoonjeong Lee; Samuel Brody) and College Station (TAMU: Jens Figlus) campuses, and the Univ. of Puerto Rico Mayag?ez (UPRM: Ismael Pagán Trinidad). Korean partners are Pusan National University (PNU) and the University of Seoul (UOS).<br/><br/>Urban and coastal flooding issues in Korea and Texas are examined through problem- and place-based case studies using the flood resilience framework developed through a decade-long collaboration between the U.S. and the Netherlands. Specifically, locations in Seoul/Busan in Korea and Houston/Galveston in Texas act as focal points to integrate expertise in engineering (TAMU/UPRM), planning (TAMUG/PNU), and public policy (TAMUG/UOS) that guide student research. Transdisciplinary place-based analyses address the following overarching research questions: 1) What are the differences in the driving factors of flooding and its associated damage between the two countries? 2) Which flood mitigation measures are more suitable for each study area and why? Students conduct research covering both surge-based and precipitation-driven flood problems. The project assesses the effectiveness and applicability of the integrative flood resilience framework in a global context, leading to a better understanding of when and where to implement specific strategies to mitigate adverse flood impacts. The participants leverage U.S. and Korean data, methods, and facilities related to flood management to generate new knowledge on global flood resilience. The program prepares the next generation of U.S. engineers, scientists, and policymakers in academia and practice to tackle the societal problem of flooding innovatively on a global scale. Furthermore, the program generates data on specific educational methods to improve learning outcomes in problem- and place-based research settings, as well as on how to enhance international experiences for students. These findings contribute to improving future international research programs and are incorporated into teaching strategies across all partner institutions. Emphasis is placed on recruiting students from all U.S. collaborating institutions, with a focus on providing them opportunities to collaborate with international students and researchers through an innovative program design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intermittent systems operate without a battery or tethered power supply and instead harvest energy from their environment, using motion, temperature gradients, and light. Eliminating the reliance on batteries improves robustness and reduces maintenance requirements, making intermittent systems suitable for deployment in harsh environments such as space or inside the body. Managing the interaction of energy collection and storage, intermittent operation, and the consequences of power failures are key challenges for the design of intermittent software. The project?s novelties are to address these challenges by using novel probabilistic modeling and analysis techniques to create serviceable timing and energy models for intermittent systems together with diagnosis tools that provide feedback during software development. The project's impacts are that energy and timing failures in intermittent systems can be diagnosed at development time and avoided without time-consuming trial-and-error experiments that run software on the target device. Moreover, the theoretical foundations of probabilistic programming for energy use in this domain enable a system designer to express, reason about, and validate energy consumption of mission critical embedded systems in domains like chip-scale satellites and in-body medical devices.<br/><br/>The main technical innovation of the proposed work is to develop probabilistic programming as a tool for modeling and formally analyzing the energy use and execution time of intermittent systems. Probabilistic programming is an emerging technology that provides an efficient and flexible interface for Bayesian machine learning. Advantages of Bayesian learning include robustness and the ability to quantify uncertainty. For intermittent systems, probabilistic programs can serve as the link between a static analysis that is sound with respect to the formal semantics of probabilistic programs and a measurement-based energy model that can incorporate detailed domain knowledge about the hardware. The project focuses on the most challenging aspects of this approach and builds on the preliminary results and complementary strengths of the investigators in probabilistic programming, static analysis of probabilistic programs, intermittent systems, and the design and implementation of intermittent software. The main objectives are (1) developing and experimentally validating an effective methodology for creating probabilistic energy and timing models of different complexity and at different abstraction levels, (2) designing static analyses that automatically derive tail bounds on the computational costs as described by the models and to apply these bounds to provide global timing guarantees and (3) to apply and test the methodology in a cooperative scheduler and runtime system that uses probabilistic energy predictions to ensure fairness of energy consumption across tasks in an intermittent execution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike classical signal processing, which works with data regularly arranged in a homogeneous space (like audio or images), graph signal processing (GSP) analyzes signals that lie on irregular graphs or networks. Important outcomes of such analysis include detecting patterns, detecting and reducing noise, and visualizing the network. GSP has become a vibrant field of research in engineering and mathematics due to its applicability to a wide range of real-world problems, such as data analysis on sensor networks, biological networks, and neural networks. In this project, the investigator uses a blend of mathematical theories and techniques to develop the theoretical underpinning and possible new applications of GSP, especially for the case of large dynamic networks that evolve over time. The investigator plans to couple this research with graduate student mentoring, organizing scientific workshops, and outreach in the scientific community.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator aims to leverage a blend of techniques from harmonic analysis, functional analysis, and graph-limit theory to address challenges in information processing, particularly in the theoretical underpinning of GSP. The goal is to develop a theory that is applicable to a wide range of large dynamic networks. The relatively recent theory of graph limits and graphons provides a valuable non-parametric approach to modeling networks, particularly for stochastic networks. Indeed, graphons represent random processes that generate networks, and networks produced by the same graphon have similar large-scale features. Many large networks that arise naturally are manifestations of an underlying (hidden) spatial reality and can be efficiently modeled using Cayley graphons. In this project, the investigator develops signal processing on Cayley graphons as well as instance-independent GSP for samples of Cayley graphons. Current instance-independent graphon-based signal-processing methods apply to only dense undirected graphs. To develop a theory that applies to a large class of (possibly sparse or directed) networks, the investigator plans to address several theoretical challenges, such as convergence of spectra for sparse/directed graphs and spectral theory of nearly Cayley graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, multi-robot systems play a critical role in our society, including industrial robots in car assembly lines, hundreds of drones in a light show, and many vehicles in future autonomous ride-sharing services. Sequential decision-making is crucial to construct functional, intelligent MAS that can meet our needs. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is an approach that facilitates machine learning through feedback that reinforces the desired behavior. However, this approach requires a quantitative reward function that is oftentimes unavailable or hard to design. Formal methods (FM), by nature, can accurately specify and verify software and hardware systems. This project aims to combine the two approaches in order to construct multi-agent systems that are more scalable, easier to understand, and safer. The investigators will also disseminate research findings, integrate them in teaching, and train graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project has the following three research objectives. Objective A develops novel specification-guided Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches that optimally decompose the specification and assign the resulting parts to agents. The principled and interpretable methods can learn a ?correct by construction? scheduler to decompose signal temporal logic specifications optimally, corresponding to the credit assignment in specification-guided MARL. Objective B aims to analyze and explain the emergent coordinated behaviors of MARL by mining specifications from the trajectory rollouts of the policies. An interaction graph in the MAS is first learned by graph neural networks, followed by a novel template-free, generative approach for specification mining in a hierarchical and scalable manner. Objective C aims to enable the transfer of MARL policies across a distribution of tasks by simultaneous specification inference and policy learning. A specification-guided meta MARL approach is developed based on approximate Bayesian inference. This work can lead to more scalable and robust autonomy in factories, warehouses, hospitals, and homes. Concrete examples include large-scale self-driving vehicles, off-road autonomy in the wild, and advanced air mobility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will make key advances towards (i) quantifying changes in the global carbon cycle from the surface to the interior ocean, (ii) supporting the development of new sensors, and (iii) enabling better integration of autonomous pH measurements into models of the ocean carbon cycle. Beneficiaries will be those of the global carbon observing community requiring accurate calibrations for a wider range of salinities and to deep ocean pressures, and scientists using pH measured on both scales to assemble global datasets, model biogeochemical processes, and ultimately improve decision making. This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the UK via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Opportunity. This Lead Agency Opportunity allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>Traditionally, pH measurements were made from research vessels and reported on the total pH scale. Recent technological advancements have enabled an array of autonomous robotic floats and gliders to measure pH, which vastly increases spatiotemporal coverage of pH measurements. However, most of these autonomous pH measurements are made on the free pH scale. Combining these datasets requires conversion between the total and free pH scales, but current knowledge gaps lead to high and poorly-constrained uncertainties. This project aims to address this knowledge gap and provide a model that will allow conversion between the total and free pH scales with well-defined uncertainties. This will be accomplished by developing a thermodynamic model of the solutions used to calibrate the total pH scale. It builds on a previous thermodynamic model, but extends its conditions to full ocean depth, as well as to low salinity, estuarine environments. The model development leverages a new thermodynamic dataset collected over the last five years. The model results will be validated in a controlled laboratory setting, as well as on a research cruise where spectrophotometric pH measurements made on the total scale will be compared to sensor pH measurements made on the free pH scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, scientists often encounter a ""silicon ceiling,"" where current computational power restricts their ability to model these intricate real-world phenomena accurately enough to achieve major breakthroughs. The SINAPSE project directly addresses this issue by developing a powerful, open-source software toolkit that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) with High-Performance Computing (HPC). This integration promises to enhance simulation capabilities, effectively offering significant orders-of-magnitude performance gains. SINAPSE will provide foundational software that benefits the broader AI-HPC research community, advancing the field itself. The project is also dedicated to supporting education and training for students in these cutting-edge computational methods, fostering the next generation of STEM professionals. By making advanced simulations more powerful and accessible, SINAPSE serves the national interest by driving innovation and enabling solutions to pressing scientific challenges.<br/><br/>The project aims to overcome the ""silicon ceiling"" limiting complex simulations by developing a Scalable Infrastructure for AI-driven Predictive Simulation Enhancements (SINAPSE), delivering an open, sustainable Software Development Kit (SDK) that seamlessly couples Artificial Intelligence (AI) with High-Performance Computing (HPC) workflows. The project will provide functional capabilities through new and enhanced core software elements for AI-coupled HPC and integrated problem-solving frameworks for common scientific discovery patterns. The methodology begins by convening the SDK with a community focus. The SDK will then be populated by creating several novel core software elements and significantly enhancing existing tools like Colmena and RHAPSODY to support diverse AI-HPC coupling needs, including dynamic and asynchronous execution. These components will be assembled into problem-solving frameworks such as ""Muse"" for online surrogate model training, ""Music"" for model-directed sampling, and ""Melody"" for multi-scale campaigns. Finally, the entire SINAPSE SDK and its frameworks will be validated and strengthened through applications in biophysics, focusing on viral glycoprotein dynamics, and materials engineering, specifically for catalyst design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many homes are not set up for their needs, and while home modifications can help, determining what changes are needed usually requires expensive and complex home assessments. This project will address this issue by using new technologies to make home assessments that are more efficient, accurate, and affordable. This research will explore issues in combining 3D sensing, augmented reality, and machine learning so that someone can automatically assess their living space as they move around in it, for example, determining if there is enough space around a coffee table in the living room for someone who uses a walker move safely. To be successful, the project must create methods for sensing the shape of the space and the objects in it, determining which objects and distances must be assessed, and displaying the assessments of them in a way that is accurate while being fast enough to be interactive for the user as they move around the space. The results of this work will enable more people to get the help they need to make their homes suitable for aging in place.<br/><br/>This project aims to utilize emerging technologies in machine learning and augmented and mixed reality to design a new method for home assessments that is more efficient, accurate, and accessible.  While traditional home assessments require highly trained individuals to perform tedious tasks in person, this research will enable adults who are aging with disabilities and their family caregivers to receive a service that is currently inaccessible to them. To automate the assessment, real-time object detection will be combined with spatial tracking and scene understanding through augmented reality devices to create a labeled model of the space. This project will require creating novel methods for achieving high-fidelity 3D spatial accuracy in home-sized settings while preserving interactivity on the augmented reality device. The project will also require developing methods to automatically detect and segment objects and features of the space that must be assessed.  From a human factors standpoint, the project will investigate the comparative advantages of mobile augmented reality and head-mounted display systems for augmented assessment tasks. The technologies will be developed under the guidance of housing and healthcare professionals alongside general users. The developed systems will be evaluated in the field to determine if they are appropriate, acceptable, and feasible for adults who are aging with disabilities and their family caregivers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before running a complex program it is important to anticipate how many resources the program needs, to best provision these resources in order to avoid any waste, while at the same time ensuring that the program executes successfully.  Database management systems often have multiple alternatives ways available on how to run a program, and the system needs to choose that alternative that uses the small amount of resources.  This project develops novel techniques for estimating the amount of data produced by a program, which in turn can be used either to provision how many resources the program needs, or to chose between alternative ways to execute the program.<br/><br/>The project develops a cardinality estimation system, which is ""pessimistic"", in the sense that it offers a one-sided theoretical guarantee that output cardinality of a query will never exceed that estimate.  To compute this estimate, the project builds on information theory and computes a tight upper bound on the output cardinality.  The estimate is computed from simple statistics on the input data, which can be collected offline, and which are already available in many current systems, such as cardinalities of base tables, number of distinct values in various columns, maximum degrees, or Lp-norms of degree sequences for various values of p.  During the offline phase, the system can further refine these statistics by dividing  the input data into buckets, then computing these statistics separately in each bucket, similar to how histograms are computed today by database management systems.  What is novel about this project is that it uses all available statistics and computes an upper bound on the output size of a query, which is guaranteed to be the tightest upper bound possible given these statistics.  The project studies new efficient ways to compute this bound, explores the potential use of Lp-sketches for computing the statistics offline and maintaining them incrementally, and extends the framework to group-by queries, for which traditional cardinality estimation methods are known to perform very poorly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed methodology is based on semiparametric modeling and is designed to address complex relationships among covariates, treatments, and outcomes. Key challenges addressed include handling multiple treatment options with cross-treatment structures, modeling a variety of outcome types, and accommodating multi-stage decision-making with time-varying, history-dependent effects. The framework also supports incorporation of domain knowledge for interpretability and practical implementation. From a statistical perspective, the proposed methods achieve double robustness (consistency under two separate model specifications) and statistical efficiency (minimal asymptotic variance), even under model misspecification and in high-dimensional or limited-data scenarios. These contributions advance the state of the art in both semiparametric theory and algorithmic design for ITR estimation.

Combining ideas from different areas of mathematical logic, from computability theory, descriptive set theory, and infinitary model theory, the Scott analysis is a way of measuring and understanding the complexity of mathematical objects. The Scott analysis is robust in the sense that it captures several different kinds of complexity that all coincide: the complexity of describing an object, the complexity of identifying two copies of an object, and the complexity of an object's internal structure. Though there remain many questions, the Scott analysis has now been well-developed for the case of discrete structures such as many structures appearing in algebra. More recently there has been increasing interest in studying continuous structures such as those appearing in analysis, a setting in which we do not have a robust Scott analysis, as there are further complication which do not arise in the discrete setting. This project will develop a robust Scott analysis in this continuous setting, including applications, while also further applying developing the Scott analysis in the more classical discrete setting. The long-term goals are to give a more rigorous and formal understanding of why certain mathematical questions are difficult or even impossible to solve, and what the barriers are to solving them. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Consider a discrete structure such as a graph, group, or Boolean algebra. The Scott analysis assigns to this structure an ordinal-valued Scott rank or more finely a Scott complexity. This is robust in the sense that it measures, simultaneously, the complexity of defining the automorphism orbits of the structure, the complexity of characterizing the structure up to isomorphism in infinitary logic, the Borel complexity of the set of copies of that structure in the topological space of all structures, and the computational complexity of building isomorphisms between copies of that structure. This project will develop such a theory in the continuous setting where the structures are metric or topological structures such as Banach spaces or manifolds. The main goal is to develop a bridge between syntactic characterizations in infinitary continuous logic and semantic characterizations in terms of computation or topology and descriptive set theory. Applications of this include studying how the Scott complexity of n-manifolds changes as n increases, or of studying the Scott complexity of Banach spaces and, for example, the impact of whether or not they have a Schauder basis.

Neuromorphic Computing is a field that started decades ago, inspired by the efficiencies of the information processing performed by biological brains. Its main goal is to replicate the complex architecture and functionality of biological neural circuits but using in-silico circuits. The field has played a key role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) systems as evidenced by the adoption of neuromorphic concepts like compute-in-memory, attention, pooling to name a few, into the mainstream AI designs. However, a detailed comparison between in-silico neuromorphic brains and biological brains reveals a significant gap between the two systems. Even a simple insect brain with fewer than a million neurons can perform and learn a variety of complex tasks, a feat currently unachievable by state-of-the-art AI systems, let alone a neuromorphic computer. On the other end of the spectrum are large-scale AI systems, such as large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers, whose success has been characterized by a rapid increase in the complexity and the size of their flowcharts involving various abstract processes. The energy cost for training and using these AI systems is becoming unsustainable, as the field strives to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) or brain-scale intelligence.

Mathematical models for physical phenomena are analyzed by studying their scaling limits, that is, their behavior over long timespan and broad spatial scope. The broad arsenal of mathematical tools used to understand these models includes computations of exact formulas for observables, non-linear stochastic and deterministic partial differential equations, and many others. This project aims to study the universality of one-dimensional random growing interfaces, which can model a wide range of physical phenomena, for example the spread of fire and the growth of bacterial colonies or liquid crystals. Recent developments in the field provide new mathematical methods to solve problems that were previously out of reach. <br/><br/>KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) universality implies that the limiting fluctuations of many mathematical models describing one-dimensional random growing interfaces are essentially the same. Such growing interfaces can be described mathematically in many ways, including free energies of directed random polymers, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. These models are expected to converge to the same scaling limit, a Markov process called the KPZ fixed point. Such models are typically studied by computing exact formulas for their observables and analyzing the scaling limits of these formulas. This project aims to study exact solutions of interacting particle systems on various domains. In particular, one of the goals of the project is to explain surprising relationships between random and classic integrable systems, such as the Kadomtsev?Petviashvili (KP) and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations and the Toda lattice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In what situations does the language comprehension process break down? Artificial intelligence (AI) language models such as ChatGPT, which appear to understand and use language as proficiently as humans do, might seem poised to provide potential answers to this question?answers that could not only enrich our scientific understanding, but also help address language processing deficits. But for AI systems to fully realize this potential, they need to process language in a similar way to humans. Many distinct lines of research show that this is not the case. One area where the discrepancy between humans and AI is particularly pronounced concerns temporary semantic ambiguity in language: cases where the first few words of the sentence are consistent with multiple interpretations, and only later in the sentence is it clear which of the interpretations is the correct one. Whereas human readers can encounter significant difficulty when they are required to change their interpretation of a sentence, AI models generally do not. The goal of this project is to better understand the reason for this misalignment between humans and AI models, and explore ways of modifying AI architectures to bring them more in line with how humans process language. In this project, the researchers will benchmark success in their model development by comparing how the models process language to how humans process language using a variety of psycholinguistic measurements. By better aligning human and AI language processing, this research will open up new directions to address long-standing limitations of current AI models, such as their need to train on far more data than human language learners do.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this proposal explores the idea that one key difference between human and machine language processing is that humans: (i) entertain only a small number of semantic interpretations of the input at a time; and, (ii) treat incremental semantic inference as a key goal in language comprehension. This is pursued through three interrelated aims. First, the proposed work will explore the unexpectedly positive correlation between a model?s perplexity and its ability to explain human reading times: put plainly, the better the model is at predicting the next word, the less similar its predictability estimates are to those of humans. Second, it explores whether the human-model misalignment can be alleviated by adopting semantic training objectives and leveraging causal intervention techniques to focus the model?s internal representations of semantic context on a small number of possible interpretations of the input. Finally, human experiments will be conducted to test the predictions of the models on novel psycholinguistic stimuli, with the goal of determining if the proposed modifications successfully bring the models more in line with human language processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models are trained on existing and historical data but are intended to be applied to future, unseen data for prediction.  Temporal shifts in data, labels, and patient populations may undermine confidence in the use of ML models utilization and raise concerns about their trustworthiness. Importantly, patient patterns can shift implicitly and may require extra inference from clinical notes (e.g., notes on access to insurance or education level). A massive body of research builds state-of-the-art models for healthcare; however, very little work has addressed the time-aware challenge to advance trustworthy ML for health. This project addresses these critical issues by developing novel methods to recognize and adapt to changes over time, which will enhance health decision support for all patient groups. The work will provide valuable educational opportunities for college and K-12 students and train the next-generation workforce in computational healthcare.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel framework for temporal learning by treating different time periods as domains, enabling a better understanding and management of shifts in health data and patient factors (e.g., information documented in notes).

The project will test these methods on real-world clinical text data and broad health decision support, such as mental health and cancer assessment.

Furthermore, compared to conversing with domain experts who can answer our questions, interaction with current systems is limited. Instead of engaging in multi-turn interaction with users, asking clarifying questions or follow-up questions, systems mostly take a passive role, aiming to provide accurate information at once.

Such robot-material hybrids could quickly respond to protect humans and structures from damage, or even perform search and rescue tasks in dangerous environments.  In order to transform on command, these materials must be active, harnessing energy.  This project also focuses on disordered active materials -- where the constituent molecules or particles are jumbled up -- because, unlike crystals, these materials don?t need to change their volume or shape when transitioning from flowing to arrested states, simplifying their design and deployment.  Currently, such materials cannot be self-assembled because scientists do not yet have a fundamental description of the design space --  i.e. how active forces, interactions between components, and local structure can be tuned to generate targeted large-scale responses.<br/><br/>To address this gap, the PI will use computational and theoretical tools to predict how disordered materials deform and rearrange under active, self-generated patterns of forces. This will involve developing a new approach for finding defects ? regions where the material is likely to flow -- in disordered active materials. The PI will then use this ?defect field? as a key quantity in a set of large-scale differential equations that predict the shape and motion of materials as a function of geometry and active forces -- much like the Navier-Stokes equations predict the motion of water under different environmental conditions.  Finally, the PI will study how to self-program the active forces -- much like the weights in a deep neural network that learns -- in order to generate specified patterns of deformation, ultimately allowing the rational design of shape-shifting disordered materials. This project will also support workforce development of graduate and undergraduate students via training in research readiness and computational materials science and engineering techniques.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a new framework to predict and program plasticity, flow, and arrest in dense amorphous active and non-reciprocal matter. Such materials exhibit glassy dynamics, and they cannot be described by a Hamiltonian, which makes theoretical approaches challenging. This project proposes to develop a continuum theory for the yielding of active solids, and then use it to program these materials to execute responsive tasks by changing shape and rheology. Past work has shown that there are large parameter regimes over which dense active matter rearranges at localized weak regions, or defects, that are defined with respect to a slowly evolving reference state. Therefore, this project will develop new nonlinear tools for identifying defects in dense active matter. A key innovation is developing a force-landscape approach that directly incorporates active forces on each particle into the definition of defects. A second innovation is that the first-principles nonlinear tools give direct access to information about the defect field (orientation, energy barrier heights, number density) that can be difficult to identify in, e.g., machine learning approaches. This is also precisely the information that will allow this project to develop coarse-grained constitutive models and physical learning frameworks to predict and control plasticity in dense active matter.<br/><br/>One broader impact of this work will be the ability to rationally program deformation and arrest in dense active and non-reciprocal matter. These materials are already under development in the lab, and have the potential to be transformative because they can harness work to change their macroscopic morphology and respond to external stimuli. Amorphous active solids are not currently programmable, as they flow intermittently and uncontrollably due to plastic avalanches. To design an amorphous material that reconfigures on command, and then supports elastic stresses without flowing when needed, this project will use a coarse-grained defect field in a continuum constitutive law to predict and control yielding and arrest in dense active matter. The constitutive relations will also inform a physical-learning approach to program deformation and global shape changes in dense active matter. Taken together, this will allow rational design of dense active materials that alter their shape and rheology to execute tasks. <br/><br/>Another set of broader impacts is in education and workforce development. This project will support participation of the PI and graduate student in a series of workforce-development activities to enhance retention and research participation in a cohort of undergraduate students at Syracuse University and in collaboration with Hampton University and North Carolina A&T. It will also directly support an undergraduate researcher on a project focused on materials design. The PI will additionally develop a formal set of typeset lecture notes for graduate students on the rheology of dense amorphous matter (both passive and active), give graduate school lectures based on those notes, and post them on preprint servers.<br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some reconstructions for this time interval suggest a stable/slow rising sea level from ice sheets retreat, while others cite evidence consistent with more variable sea level from rapid ice sheet volume changes. While evidence for this problem remains controversial, a new methodology was recently applied, and firm evidence was found for a brief local fall in sea level at a single location. However, the timing and rate of sea level change are still poorly constrained, and the global extent of this feature remains unknown. This project seeks to build on this new approach and combine it with high-precision dating to refine our understanding of the rates and extent of Last Interglacial ice sheet retreat and sea level change. This project will provide professional development and mentoring opportunities for the fellow and develop a virtual field trip website using drone and other imagery to expand accessibility of sea level research. <br/><br/>Shallow marine carbonates such as coral reefs can be used to help reconstruct the magnitude of past sea level changes. This project will leverage existing samples collected from fossil coral reefs around the globe that grew during the Last Interglacial. The focus will be on Last Interglacial coral reef deposits in Western Australia and the Seychelles that contain three distinct generations of reef growth separated by disconformities or transitional sedimentary facies, to test the question of sea-level variability. The main goals of the project are (1) to assess whether there is evidence of subaerial exposure associated with the sedimentary surfaces bounding the reef units and (2) define the time represented between the deposition of reef units. New cutting-edge, super resolution autofluorescence (SRAF) microscopy that can reveal fine-scale carbonate petrography will be combined with U-series coral geochronology within detailed stratigraphic frameworks to determine the timing and magnitude of potential subaerial exposure events and to correlate observed relative sea-level change between sites. This project will produce important proxy data to calibrate and improve ice sheet models to determine which ice sheets were most susceptible to past warming and how future ice sheet retreat will affect U.S. and global coastlines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their audiovisual content is often inaccessible to a whole range of people (e.g., those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing or who are blind or have low vision. While methods for making videos accessible exist, videos are often created first and then modified to make them accessible. In addition, even when video files include appropriate accessibility features, playback contexts may introduce new challenges. These include small screen sizes or low volume in devices with small speakers. Expanding a recent concept of responsive videos, this project seeks to extend video responsiveness to encompass and mitigate a range of challenges. This should allow people with sensory disabilities to watch, listen or read the content of a video without missing critical information. The research will result in recommendations for responsive videos, which can be, by design, more accessible, adaptable, and useful for people with and without disabilities alike.<br/><br/>The project aims to achieve three main objectives. First, the project team will employ content analysis to create a taxonomy of common audiovisual components in videos. These would need to adapt to variations in display sizes and changing audio-visual modalities (e.g. audio and visual modalities alone, and text-only modalities) to ensure accessibility. Second, a series of interviews and co-design sessions with DHH and BLV participants will explore these types of viewers' needs and requirements for video responsiveness. Third, the team will use design ethnography and interviews with non-disabled video creators to explore opportunities in the video creation and editing process.  This process will generate the information needed to address the needs and requirements of viewers. Together, these efforts will help establish recommendations for the design and evaluation of responsive videos, leading to a holistic approach to making videos accessible by design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first-of-its-kind event will bring together experts in a relatively small subfield of mathematical physics to concentrate efforts on making meaningful progress on open problems while training a new generation of students and early-career mathematicians to work in the area. The workshop activities are designed with the intention of developing a strong network of researchers in equivariant topological quantum field theory across the Americas.<br/><br/>Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) give mathematically rigorous descriptions of systems whose physics is independent of the geometry of spacetime. These theories are playing an increasingly important role in theoretical and mathematical physics, where they model the symmetries of ordinary quantum field theories as well as certain low-energy quantum systems called topological phases of matter which are influential in developing both hardware and software for quantum computers. TQFTs are also an invaluable source of inspiration in pure mathematics, where they provide a bridge between the subjects of algebra and topology. Equivariant TQFTs specifically capture TQFTs with symmetry and thus represent a critical aspect in the study of TQFTs.

The aim of the project is both to advance a scientific understanding of important physical phenomena, as well as to make quantitative predictions whenever possible. The problems under study are motivated by real-life applications with potential societal benefits. In the first part of the project, the Principal Investigator studies the interaction between incompressible fluid flows and walls, focusing on two problems. The first problem pertains to the motion of inviscid fluids in containers with permeable walls that allow for injection and suction, and how the rate and direction of injection and suction affects the flow. This problem has many applications from the study of fluids in sections of pipelines, to modeling of underground wells. The second problem focuses on a simplified model of the Earth, consisting in a fluid-filled solid shell, representing the Earth?s crust and mantle, containing a solid core, and on the long-time combined motion of the fluid-solid system. In the second part of the project, the Principal Investigator examines the effects of material transport and diffusion in certain fluid models. Two problems are considered. The first problem concerns flame front propagation in combustion and phase separation in fluid mixtures, for instance binary alloys. The second problem concerns modeling of fluid planets, such as certain exoplanets, combining the effects of rotation, gravitation, convection and magnetism. The last part of the project focuses on elastic materials, more specifically problems stemming from applications in seismology, where the Earth?s crust is modeled as an elastic solid. Remote monitoring of buried faults and magma chambers from satellite data during quiescent periods with no detectable seismic activity is investigated. The project includes also training activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to study various problems characterized by singularities and ill-posedness of partial differential equations modeling the behavior of incompressible fluids and elastic solids. These problems are tackled using primarily analytic techniques, but also computational tools. The goal of the project is to make progress in our understanding of important processes, such as phase separation in mixtures, and make quantitative predictions, such as the reconstruction of unknown parameters in inverse problems. The project consists in three main parts: I. Wall interactions in hydrodynamics models; II. Transport, dissipation, and their interplay in non-linear systems; III. Boundary inverse problems for geophysical models. The project addresses questions motivated by fundamental physical phenomena. Hence, the project is both timely and relevant. Part I concerns the behavior of incompressible flows near rigid walls. Injection and suction can stabilize boundary layers. Fluid-structure interaction is mediated by boundary forces. Part II concerns the combined effect of advection and dissipation in non-linear systems. Long-wave instability can be mitigated by dissipation. Strong advection can accelerate phase separation. Convection, dissipation, and geodynamo all contribute to planetary motion. Part III concerns remote probing of geophysical systems. Fault monitoring is key to predicting earthquake nucleation. In volcanoes, the magma chamber is often inaccessible. The three parts of the project are distinct, but connected in a cohesive research program by the underlying themes of singularity and ill-posedness.This research brings about challenging mathematical questions, which requires novel ideas and techniques: singularities in various forms, from non-smooth domains, to non-standard interface and boundary conditions, to ill-posedness and instability, for instance, permeate the entire project. Several of the problems under study, such as shape optimization in Part III, have a computational component that is also addressed. Progress on these problems is likely to have impact in other fields. The project offers training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as dissemination to the broader scientific community and outreach to society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predictive maintenance plays a crucial role in manufacturing by optimizing equipment reliability, minimizing downtime, and reducing costs, yet current artificial intelligence-driven solutions often underperform in practice due to a misalignment between how models are trained and how maintenance decisions are made. Many artificial intelligence models rely on standard statistical metrics that do not directly reflect maintenance objectives, leading to costly and inefficient decision-making. This research looks to introduce a systematic approach that ensures artificial intelligence models are designed to improve actual maintenance outcomes, not just predictive accuracy. By embedding operational objectives and constraints directly into artificial intelligence model training, the project seeks to enable manufacturers to deploy predictive maintenance solutions that are both effective and practical. The findings from this research look to support the broader adoption of artificial intelligence in predictive maintenance for manufacturing systems, contributing to national economic prosperity and the progress of science and engineering. Additionally, the project seeks to develop educational materials and outreach programs to integrate artificial intelligence alignment concepts into engineering curricula and prepare future professionals for artificial intelligence-driven industries.<br/><br/>This research aims to establish model-agnostic strategies that improve the decision-making impact of predictive maintenance models in manufacturing. The objectives include: (i) designing machine learning models that explicitly incorporate maintenance cost and operational constraints into predictive modeling; (ii) extending the unit-level prognostics to fleet-level maintenance decision-making through Bayesian optimization to enhance scalability and adaptability; and (iii) assessing the framework?s effectiveness under various industrial settings using real-world and simulated manufacturing datasets. The project seeks to answer fundamental questions such as: (1) how can artificial intelligence models be trained to optimize for real-world operational objectives rather than simple proxy metrics, such as average prediction accuracy? and (2) how can unit-level predictions be integrated into fleet-level maintenance decision-making? By addressing these questions, the project strives to advance artificial intelligence alignment for decision-making in predictive maintenance and contribute to the broader field of artificial intelligence for manufacturing applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, state-of-the-art AI still exhibits a large (orders of magnitude) efficiency gap compared to human brains. Enabling efficient AI hardware/software systems will be the key to deploying AI in various domains, including transportation, healthcare, and defense. Taking cues from the biological brains, neuro-inspired computing recently emerges as a promising approach to addressing the computational efficiency challenges. However, neuro-inspired computing with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) digital hardware lacks flexibility and efficiency due to mismatch at various levels from device to architecture. This project will leverage novel magneto-electronic (spintronic) technologies to create efficient and robust computational components that emulate neural stochastic functionality. The components will be integrated into in-memory computing architectures and co-designed with bio-inspired learning algorithms to achieve advanced cognitive capabilities. This project will significantly advance the science of developing next-generation AI hardware with emerging technologies. By implementing device-to-system co-design for stochastic in-memory computing, this project will create interdisciplinary knowledge of device integration, computing architecture design, and algorithm development. Such knowledge is crucial for addressing the challenges of AI computation.<br/><br/>In this project, two interesting attributes of biological brains, i.e., stochastic computing and processing in memory, will be exploited to develop novel computing systems for AI.  Stochastic spin-orbit-torque magnetic tunnel junctions with high thermal stability will be customized to realize various functionalities of an in-memory computing system. Compared to the existing work with thermally unstable devices, the proposed high-stability devices minimize the influence of noises and device variations, leading to a scalable solution for the robust and efficient implementation of stochastic neural networks. The new device design will also drastically reduce the overhead of peripheral circuits in the in-memory processing elements. To further unleash the full potential of the proposed spin-based stochastic neuro-mimetic components, we explore device-to-algorithm co-design, including a hardware-in-the-loop architecture search to develop neural network models that could better match the hardware characteristics. We will demonstrate prototypes of domain-specific stochastic neuromorphic computing systems for general deep neural networks.

The variation in carbon prices set on the commonly shared electric power network, which is federally regulated through the Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs), can distort the operations and planning of the power grid, leading to environmental leakages, loss of carbon tax revenues, and other undesirable outcomes. The goal of this research project is to provide practical evaluation tools to support policy makers on carbon pricing integration, particularly modeling and setting the carbon border adjustment and carbon tax revenue recycling effectively into the operations and planning of the US electric power network such that electricity market distortion is reduced, environmental leakages are mitigated, impacts on ratepayers are minimized, individual interests of states and RTOs are balanced, and the impacts of carbon prices are quantified. Furthermore, this project presents an opportunity to train and educate K12/undergraduate/graduate students on the technical challenges of electricity market design, power systems economics, optimization, game theory, and operations research <br/><br/>This research project views the setting of regulatory policies, particularly carbon border adjustments and carbon tax revenues, as complementary mathematical optimization problems. Specifically, the project will incorporate and tune constraints representing policy intervention, which are imposed on the existing operations and planning optimization model of electric power network, to adjust the operations and planning?s optimal solutions, both primal and dual, to balance the interests of states and RTOs and optimize certain economic, and environmental metrics representing carbon pricing impacts. For computational tractability, the mechanism design problem will be conducted on an aggregated power network model, while the evaluation of regulatory policies can be regarded as the sensitivity analysis of the power system operations and planning model.  The latter can be conducted on a realistic large-scale network using recent advances in grid modeling tools. The project looks to leverage machine learning approaches to adaptively model used in mechanism design, so that the policy evaluation conducted on the large-scale realistic grid model is improved.  The project seeks to produce formal mathematical models and planning and analysis tools that help policymakers with sustainable carbon pricing integration.

Opioid pain medications are very addictive; thus, the CDC recommends non-pharmacological approaches as the first course of action for pain management. Chronic musculoskeletal pain affects over 40 percent of US citizens. Musculoskeletal manipulation has proven effective at treating many types of pain but requires a human to perform costly, labor-intensive therapy. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant will support fundamental research in the development of soft robotic devices that can be pneumatically actuated to perform musculoskeletal manipulation for targeted pain relief. The human-robot interaction required for such therapy involves a large amount of physical contact; therefore, safety becomes a large design requirement. Current humanoid rigid robots can perform a variety of tasks. However, this ability to generalize gives them the freedom to be unsafe for physically therapeutic applications. This research aims to produce highly constrained, targeted soft devices with mechanical safety limits that are individually customized to each individual?s anatomy and pain pathologies which may range from back pain to arthritis to post-stroke hand spasticity. Besides the societal impact of pain reduction, this research will contribute to fundamental advances in soft robotic design, scalable customization, soft additive manufacturing, flexible electronics, sensor design, physics-based simulations, mechatronics, pneumatics, interactive control, and data-driven modeling. Student researchers will benefit from this applied, multidisciplinary problem space, rich with complex challenges, which can inspire a passion for future careers in various mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, robotics, and data science disciplines.<br/><br/>This grant is about enabling autonomous delivery of musculoskeletal therapy through the development of customized soft robotic systems that can safely and effectively interact with the human body. The research effort consists of several tightly integrated components that span sensing, modeling, design, and control. At the core of the approach is the development of soft, stretchable e-skin sensors with dense pressure arrays, created using novel flexible electronics and soft additive manufacturing techniques. These sensors will be applied to pain-affected regions of participants to capture high-resolution force and motion data during therapist-administered manual manipulations. This data, along with detailed 3D scans of each participant, will be used to construct high-fidelity physics-based simulations that replicate therapist-patient interaction. These simulations serve as the foundation for optimizing soft robotic designs and pneumatic actuation profiles using evolutionary algorithms. Each design will be customized to the user?s specific anatomy and pain condition, whether it involves back pain, arthritis, or post-stroke spasticity. The optimized robotic structures will be fabricated through soft 3D printing processes and integrated with pneumatic control systems. During therapy, the same e-skin sensors will be reused to provide real-time force and position feedback. This feedback will drive closed-loop control strategies that look to combine physics-based and data-driven models of the human-robot system. The goal is to achieve safe and adaptive manipulation that can respond to the user?s changing physical state. Overall, this research contributes to fundamental advances in soft robotics, personalized therapeutic devices, human-robot interaction, and intelligent control systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decentralized decision-making naturally arises in many scenarios, notably in supply chains and transportation and logistics, where multiple self-interested agents share a finite collection of common resources and influence each other's behavior.  One crucial challenge arising in decentralized systems is the lack of coordination among interdependent decisions, which are made locally but have broader system-wide implications. This research project will approach decentralized decision-making through a game theoretic framework.  For systems where the decisions are chosen from a discrete set, this project explores a computational approach that exploits the discrete nature of the individual optimization problems.  The models and algorithms developed will be evaluated on a problem involving multiple loosely coordinated agents providing logistic support for post-disaster operations, with the goal to improve resource utilization and coordination among responding organizations. The educational component of the project aims to engage undergraduates and K-12 students in science through a community-building series and a structured portfolio of outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project will integrate techniques from integer optimization and algorithmic game theory to establish new theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for resource-sharing games. In these games, multiple decision-makers, each solving their own integer optimization problem, interact while sharing a common set of resources. The methodology will leverage polyhedral characterizations, sparsity structures and decomposition methods beyond optimization, to provide certificates for existence of equilibrium solutions, algorithms for computing exact or approximate equilibria, bounds on equilibria inefficiency, and strategies to reduce such inefficiency.

A key innovation is anticipate to lie in turning ubiquitous calcium carbonate into a monolithic binder as a potential alternative to cement and concrete, rather than a raw material thermally decomposed in traditional cement manufacturing. Towards this end, novel synthesis and strengthening pathways will be explored to address the fundamental challenges in constructing continuously structured inorganic monoliths and tackling the poor fracture toughness and low tensile strength of crystalline minerals. By redefining the synthesis process and improving the properties of materials and structures in a truly sustainable and cost-effective way, the anticipated project outcomes could ultimately shed light on multiple research areas and industrial sectors, including civil engineering, materials science, mechanical engineering, advanced manufacturing, and the utilization of abundant and renewable resources with long-term economic and environmental benefits.

This hypothesis will be tested by computationally and experimentally investigating polymer-like precursors, refining reaction pathways, and regulating molecular-scale interactions. Inspired by the mineralization pathways in living organisms, the unique non-classical strategy looks to provide a thermodynamically favored pathway for tailoring mineral-based binders under ambient conditions by bypassing the critical free energy that must be overcome in conventional approaches. To enhance toughness and tensile strength, multiple bio-inspired toughening mechanisms, including copolymerization with organic monomers to tailor hybrid molecules, incorporation of coherent nanodomains to trigger pre-strained crystal lattices, and construction of packed and aligned nano-reinforcement, will be tailored and integrated across multiple length and time scales.

How this stretching and pulling affects the nerves is unknown, which makes it difficult for a doctor to predict and prevent NBPP and delays treatment for injured newborns. This project will investigate how the nerves in the neck respond when subjected to various levels of stretch and for different durations. The team will use an animal model that has similarities to human newborns to understand NBPP. By stretching the nerves to different degrees and for varying lengths of time, the team will understand the response of these nerves and the limit when injury occurs. The project will also develop computer simulations that will mimic the conditions during complicated deliveries and allow researchers to estimate the stress the nerves experience during stretching. This study will enable the team to develop a practical tool that doctors can use to better predict NBPP and make informed decisions that reduce the risk of nerve injuries in newborns. The project will also help train the future science and engineering workforce by engaging students in research, fostering interest in STEM fields, and encouraging future contributions to healthcare advancements. <br/><br/>NBPP untreated has serious long term impacts including muscle atrophy, impaired bone development, and osteoarthritis. There is a critical knowledge gap correlating the effects of over-extended neck, prolonged delivery, and mechanical forces imposed on the neonatal brachial plexus (NBP) during obstructed delivery. This limits understanding of the injury mechanism and ultimately delays prognosis and appropriate intervention in the affected newborn. This study will address this critical gap by investigating the stress relaxation behavior of the NBP when subjected to clinically relevant magnitude and durations of pre-stretch as observed during prolonged head-to-body delivery. The study will leverage a neonatal animal model to provide biomechanical failure data and structural changes in the NBP that are pre-stretched to a range of stretch magnitudes (10%, 15%, and 20% strains) and duration (90 and 300 seconds) as observed during prolonged delivery in the clinic. The study will also integrate experimental data with computational models of the maternal pelvis and neonate that will serve as a surrogate and help overcome the existing ethical limitations in accessing NBP biomechanical information. By using experimentally obtained viscoelastic properties of the NBP, the computations will evaluate NBP risk factors that include endogenous maternal forces, exogenous clinician-applied forces, and fetopelvic disproportion. This integrated approach will enable a highly translational predictive tool that can simulate prolonged delivery in an over-extended neck and predict NBP strains during birthing. The project will also enable hands-on experience for undergraduate students through design courses and summer research programs and for K-12 students through engineering summer camp programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To be effective semiconductors, CP must be able to transport charges effectively. However, optimizing stretchability, strength, and charge transport in these polymers is a challenge. This project will address this by introducing special cross-links between the polymer chain ends. These cross-links will be based on dynamic metal-ligand (ML) bonds, which are known to improve the toughness of non-conjugated polymers. This research will transform the field of organic electronics by providing an easy way to obtain tough CP without compromising charge transport. The enhanced toughness will lead to mechanically stable CP films, essential for preventing cracking of flexible devices. This will impact electronic devices that provide energy, information, or light. The improved toughness will also enable new functionalities such as wearability, compact packaging, and portability. This research will train graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students to be the next generation of scientists.

This project?s main hypothesis is that tough CP with good charge transport properties can be obtained using dynamic ML cross-links between the ends of CP. This hypothesis will be tested by synthesizing ligand-terminated CP and investigating the effect of the ML cross-links on structural, mechanical, and electrical properties. CP tensile strength will be tuned with the ML binding strength and loading. Stretchability will be enhanced using a flexible spacer between the CP and ligand. To simultaneously optimize mechanical and electrical properties, a novel scalable method to introduce cross-links in films will be investigated. The fundamental structure-property relationship will be studied using well-defined regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a model polymer. The strategy will be expanded to high-performance donor-acceptor CP. This approach will also be applied to fabricate mechanically stable organic photovoltaic devices. This project will explore for the first time how using dynamic cross-links at the CP chain ends can tune film properties, thus advancing fundamnetal knowledge of CP end-group chemistry and its effects on properties. It has the potential to transform the field of organic electronics by providing an easy way to increase toughness of CP while retaining desirable electronic properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the vast range of length and time scales inherent in the manufacturing process makes constructing PSP maps computationally prohibitive. This research seeks to address this challenge by developing a computationally efficient surrogate model for solidification, significantly accelerating both forward and inverse problems on the process-structure (PS) linkage.

The research will: (1) develop a model reduction framework tailored for nonlinear transport-dominated processes, (2) construct a parametric ROM that maps process parameters to microstructure attributes, and (3) establish an inverse problem framework for optimizing process parameters.

It was recently shown that these unique states of matter can also be created using pulsed power plasmas. Based on a deeper knowledge of how hollow ions are formed and behave, powerful new tools for examining other complex, high-energy-density plasma environments can be developed.

This project develops novel strategies for machines to effectively learn in limited labeled data scenarios. The foundation of the new strategies lies in data analysis and algorithm development and the project involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students in these areas through mentoring and curriculum development.

In particular, the proposed research encompasses the following three aims:  (1) development of graph-based similarity-driven auction dynamics learning methods (2) development of graph-based similarity-driven neural network methods (3) development of graph-based similarity-driven maximum-flow learning methods. Although all three aims involve developing graph-based approaches for learning tasks using semi-supervised techniques, each of the aims will formulate procedures with their own advantages.

Because of their ubiquity in nature, nucleosides have either been scaffolds or inspiration for the development of novel molecules with diverse applications and utilities. These applications include medicinally and pharmacologically important entities, modification of the genetic code, and as detection tools and probes of biochemical and biological processes. Nucleosides are composed of two parts, a base and sugar. Because of their structural components and multiple reaction sites, the chemical reactivities of nucleosides can be quite complex. The overarching goal of this work will be to obtain a fundamental understanding of chemical processes to achieve desired selective modifications of the nucleoside family of compounds. Professor Lakshman?s research group consists of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates. Thus, trainees at all educational levels will cohesively contribute to the research goals. Students obtain professional hands-on experience in planning, developing, and performing chemical reactions, as well as the purification and characterization of products.

In what situations does the language comprehension process break down? Artificial intelligence (AI) language models such as ChatGPT, which appear to understand and use language as proficiently as humans do, might seem poised to provide potential answers to this question?answers that could not only enrich our scientific understanding, but also help address language processing deficits. But for AI systems to fully realize this potential, they need to process language in a similar way to humans. Many distinct lines of research show that this is not the case. One area where the discrepancy between humans and AI is particularly pronounced concerns temporary semantic ambiguity in language: cases where the first few words of the sentence are consistent with multiple interpretations, and only later in the sentence is it clear which of the interpretations is the correct one. Whereas human readers can encounter significant difficulty when they are required to change their interpretation of a sentence, AI models generally do not. The goal of this project is to better understand the reason for this misalignment between humans and AI models, and explore ways of modifying AI architectures to bring them more in line with how humans process language. In this project, the researchers will benchmark success in their model development by comparing how the models process language to how humans process language using a variety of psycholinguistic measurements. By better aligning human and AI language processing, this research will open up new directions to address long-standing limitations of current AI models, such as their need to train on far more data than human language learners do.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this proposal explores the idea that one key difference between human and machine language processing is that humans: (i) entertain only a small number of semantic interpretations of the input at a time; and, (ii) treat incremental semantic inference as a key goal in language comprehension. This is pursued through three interrelated aims. First, the proposed work will explore the unexpectedly positive correlation between a model?s perplexity and its ability to explain human reading times: put plainly, the better the model is at predicting the next word, the less similar its predictability estimates are to those of humans. Second, it explores whether the human-model misalignment can be alleviated by adopting semantic training objectives and leveraging causal intervention techniques to focus the model?s internal representations of semantic context on a small number of possible interpretations of the input. Finally, human experiments will be conducted to test the predictions of the models on novel psycholinguistic stimuli, with the goal of determining if the proposed modifications successfully bring the models more in line with human language processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these ecosystems face increasing threats from human activities like coastal development and fish farming (aquaculture), which can pollute the environment. This international research partnership, called the HERITOR Project, studies the impact of aquaculture waste on seashore biodiversity in Cape Verde, a group of islands off the coast of West Africa. Understanding these impacts is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies and protecting these valuable natural resources for the future. This IRES project provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in international research, and to develop science communication skills through their outreach work in Cape Verde and the U.S. This project fosters development of the next generation of scientists equipped with the skills to monitor marine biodiversity and solve important environmental problems. Research conducted through this project contributes to global efforts in preserving marine ecosystems and biodiversity documentation.<br/><br/>The HERITOR project establishes a baseline of seashore biodiversity in Cape Verde and monitors changes over three years, before and after the release of waste from a shrimp aquaculture plant. Research teams examine various components of the ecosystem, including fish, macroinvertebrates, and algae, at the aquaculture site and a nearby control site. The project uses various research methods, including underwater cameras, acoustic monitoring, and ecological surveys. Through this project, 18 undergraduate students from Bridgewater State University are trained by U.S. and Cape Verdean experts in marine ecology, conservation science and statistical analyses. For 8 weeks each summer, students conduct research that builds knowledge and capacity for ecological monitoring in Cape Verde. Their research experience is enhanced by immersion in the social and cultural landscape of Cape Verde, a critical element for preparing U.S. students to effectively collaborate in international scientific endeavors. The summer research program is flanked by pre- and post-travel training in ecological theory, conceptual frameworks in biodiversity conservation, standard research methods and skills, and data analysis. Students also develop leadership and communication skills as they discuss their findings with both scientific and public audiences. The combination of development of strong research skills alongside leadership capabilities is crucial for preparing well-rounded STEM professionals who will drive global innovation and engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Southeast U.S. wetlands have a high frequency of fires due to excessive growth of biomass. The emissions from these fires and their impacts are not fully understood.  This project will use advanced tools and controlled laboratory experiments to study wetland biomass burning emissions and their environmental impacts. The project will examine the physical and chemical properties of aerosols generated from combustion. Toxicity measurements will further elucidate the health effects of wetland biomass burning aerosols. The results from the project will improve the ability to manage wetland fires and predict their influence on air quality, environment, and human health. The results will also include new educational activities and museum demonstrations to help students and society better understand and manage wildland fires.<br/> <br/>Wildland fires, encompassing prescribed fires and wildfires, are essential to many ecosystems that shape landscapes, control pests, and promote biodiversity. Biomass burning during wildland fires contributes significantly to aerosols in the global atmosphere as a leading source of black carbon and primary organic aerosol emissions. However, substantial uncertainties persist regarding the amounts and properties of the primary and secondary biomass burning aerosols since there is a scarcity of experiments with well controlled burning and photochemical aging conditions. Moreover, most biomass burning research has focused on woody biomass or biomass representative of West U.S., with limited attention to biomass representative of Southeast U.S. wetland systems, despite their high fire frequency and fire magnitude. The knowledge gaps caused by this lack of data hinder the ability to accurately predict the impact of Southeast U.S. wetland biomass burning on air quality and public health. To address these issues, this CAREER project will examine the physiochemical and toxicological properties of wetland BB aerosols. The drop-tube furnace, recognized for its precise control over flow and temperature during solid fuel combustion, will be used.  The measurement of secondary aerosols under varying burning and photochemical aging conditions can be used to reconcile differences between laboratory and field observations. Further investigations on aerosol hygroscopic growth and in vitro toxicity will shed light on respiratory deposition and potential health effects of wetland biomass burning aerosols. The results of the project can provide guidance for prescribed burns and firefighting strategies, helping minimize health risks associated with fire management. Given the proximity of our primary biomass sampling location, Everglades National Park, to the populated Miami Dade County, the characteristics of biomass burning aerosols can be used to evaluate the risks and impacts of fires at similar wildland and urban interfaces. The proposed project integrates research and education, where the research will be showcased and will be integrated into new academic activities and outreach programs. The academic activities, including developing new course contents and advising graduate and undergraduate students, will enrich the learning experiences of students in environmental engineering and related disciplines. The outreach programs enabled through the partnership with a local science museum will further benefit academic and regional communities in addressing issues associated with wildland fires.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such distributions are often utilized in statistical modeling to incorporate non-linearity, robustness to large observations, and sparsity in high-dimensional data. The overarching goal of this project is to build new scalable statistical methods that incorporate heavy-tailed prior distributions in three disparate application areas: independent component estimation that recovers independent, latent sources from their observed mixtures, astronomical distance estimation from parallax measurements, and statistical modeling of compositional data. The research will result in powerful Bayesian tools with rigorous theoretical justification. This project will also narrow the critical gap between methodological advances in statistics and the tools used by the scientific community and promote increased usage and transparency of state-of-the-art Bayesian tools. The research findings will be incorporated into various educational activities to engage K-12 students. The project will provide research opportunities and training for graduate students and will enhance undergraduate and graduate curricula, accompanied by a monograph.<br/><br/><br/>This project develops Bayesian methodologies to address three significant statistical challenges: (1) unifying feature extraction techniques via novel latent space representations in independent component analysis, (2) improving astronomical distance estimation by incorporating measurement errors and non-linear relationships in parallax data, and (3) constructing prior distributions tailored for high-dimensional simplex-valued data that can adapt to arbitrary sparsity and dependence patterns. By leveraging heavy-tailed priors within hierarchical models, this work provides a new framework for controlling higher-order moments in blind source separation and as mixing densities for normal scale mixtures for handling non-linearity, robustness, and sparsity. The methods to be developed will be rigorously tested in applications spanning astronomy, blind source separation, community detection, and ecological modeling of species diversity and affinity, demonstrating their broad utility. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications in statistics, machine learning, and other scientific journals, and software implementations will be openly accessible as R packages that benefit the wider quantitative science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are often called ""forever chemicals"" because they persist for long periods in the environment. PFAS can contaminate groundwater supplies. Recent reports suggest that PFAS is present in the drinking water of 200 million Americans. The problem is especially severe in communities that lack municipal water supplies and rely on groundwater. Large-scale PFAS monitoring is expensive. This project will advance a new PFAS-detection technology that is faster, cheaper, and more sensitive than current detection methods. The project will also raise awareness of PFAS risks and mitigation strategies. Additional benefits include research opportunities for undergraduate students and undergraduate coursework in entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The project will advance a new method called Molecule-Probed Raman Spectroscopy (MPRS) for pollutant detection. MPRS relies on molecular probes that are attached to a polymer surface. This is different from state-of-the-art Raman methods which detect C-F bonds in PFAS directly, without using molecular probes. In MPRS, when the -CF group of the PFAS interacts with the molecular probe, there is a change in the Raman signal of the molecular probe. By monitoring this change in signal, MPRS can detect even low levels of PFAS rapidly. The project will integrate experiments with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations to discover the interactions between PFAS and polymers in aquatic environments. The key objectives of this research are to: (1) understand fundamental mechanisms of how interactions between PFAS and molecular probes amplify Raman signals and therefore discover new probes for PFAS detection, (2) investigate factors that influence the PFAS adsorption, and (3) explore how salts impact molecular interactions and PFAS detection. This project will create a portable sensor for ultra-sensitive, rapid  quantification of PFAS from a variety of water sources such as groundwater, brackish water, and blood.

Modern research in mathematics naturally encounters more abstract notions of symmetry and requires the development of more advanced techniques for their study. The PI will identify and study concrete instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two and three. The research will also develop new connections between algebra, representation theory, and low dimensional topology. This project integrates education, research, and career training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Examples include creating a series of videos which will improve the algebra education of Utah's high school mathematics teachers-in-training, and organizing the graduate student focused Moab Topology Conference.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will engage in three related research projects. Each project is motivated by and has direct implications for the long-standing conjecture that Rozansky-Witten theory, a three dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory, defines a non-semisimple topological field theory. In the first project the PI will further develop and extend the theory of relative modular categories and their associated non-semisimple topological field theories to find new connections with homological blocks of 3-manifolds. In the second project the PI will develop the representation theory of affine L-infinity algebras and unrolled quantum groups and use the results to construct abelian approximations of Rozansky-Witten theory. In the third project the PI will extend his work on twisted equivariant matrix factorizations to construct non-semisimple, possibly unoriented, topological field theories for Landau-Ginzburg theory and explore their interpretation as Rozansky-Witten defects.

Witnessed by the negative resolution of Connes? embedding problem, there has been a surge of interactions between operator algebras and quantum information theory (mainly surrounding understanding quantum entanglement, quantum channels and nonlocal games). 2. The area of non-commutative (nc) function theory of several complex variables has experienced explosive growth in the past decade. In the one-variable setting, function theory is intimately connected with operator theory. While questions about holomorphic functions of several complex matrices have proven more difficult, recent progress in the area seems promising. This area links to nc probability and nc harmonic analysis. 3. The field of harmonic analysis is a classical branch of analysis that has important applications and connections to a variety of other fields including analysis of PDEs, geometric combinatorics, geometric measure theory, scattering theory, and complex analysis.

As the geographic separation grows between food production and consumption, food supply chains are increasingly exposed to local and distant climatic disruptions. Current research has focused mostly on the production of a few staple crops, leaving substantial gaps in understanding domestic and international climate risks to an array of U.S. food supply chains. This project will pioneer new approaches to systematically detect, attribute, and track individual climate disruptions to food production along the entire food supply chain to locations of consumption in the U,S. Research findings will increase national capabilities to identify and track climate-associated food supply chain disruptions, thereby supporting investments and policies to enhance the resilience and competitiveness of the U.S. economy and protecting national food security against climate-related disruptions. The project will support a comprehensive education plan to achieve widespread reach at K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels and local, state, and national scales. <br/><br/>The overarching question addressed by this project is: How, where, and to what extent do climate-related disruptions to food production travel through domestic and international supply chains to affect U.S. food supply? This project aims to create a quantitative framework to detect, track, and attribute climate disruptions throughout the entire food supply chain and the full food basket. The central hypothesis is that specific combinations of food items, climate extremes, and supply chain structures can collectively undermine the resilience of food supply chains. This research will systematically quantify climate risks and identify opportunities to enhance resilience through three objectives: i) measure climate vulnerability of U.S. crop production, ii) characterize national and global food trade networks, and iii) identify opportunities to reduce climate vulnerabilities. These activities will integrate with the project?s education goal to enhance understanding of sustainability and resilience through systems thinking. This plan includes developing science modules for middle and high school students and creating summer research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, aiming to increase interest in STEM careers and interdisciplinary collaboration. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the ENG/CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids and are fundamental to science and engineering, with applications ranging from weather forecasting and ocean modeling to aircraft design and pipe flow. Despite their widespread use, key theoretical questions remain unanswered?most notably, the global regularity and uniqueness of solutions in three space dimensions. This question is one of the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems. The proposed research aims to develop a new mathematical and computational approach to uncover possible mechanisms that lead to singularity formation in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. This work is significant because understanding how such singularities form could provide new insight into turbulence, which plays a central role in many physical systems. The broader impacts include the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in mathematical analysis, modeling, and large-scale simulation. This research directly supports NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare.<br/> <br/>The investigator develops a novel approach to study the potential finite-time singularity in the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with smooth initial data of finite energy. The project begins by analyzing a generalized version of the equations in a space of fractional dimension slightly above three. In this setting, the space dimension is treated as a tunable parameter that helps eliminate scaling instability and reveals the formation of an asymptotically self-similar blowup solution. The investigator then considers the vanishing viscosity limit as the space dimension approaches three. The numerical evidence suggests that the potential singularity is not of exactly self-similar, but rather of Type II with logarithmic corrections. Using a novel two-scale dynamic rescaling formulation and a derived leading-order reduced two-dimensional system, the investigator aims to identify and eliminate unstable modes in the solution. This will allow the construction of a stable singularity profile and potentially enable a computer-assisted proof of finite-time blowup in a generalized Navier-Stokes system. The successful execution of this research could provide a pathway toward resolving the Clay Millennium Problem and advance the theoretical understanding of turbulence. Graduate students involved in the project will gain valuable experience in rigorous partial differential equation analysis and high-performance numerical computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, a problem formulated by Diophantus in the third century, when translated into the language of a polynomial equation, amounts to determining the rational solutions (x, y) to the equation y^2 = x^6 + x^2 + 1. This problem remained unsolved until the work of Wetherell in 1997.  Studying this algebraic equation from the point of view of geometry yields a curve, and more precisely, a curve of genus 2.  While curves of genus 2 or more are known to have finitely many rational points by the work of Faltings in 1983, as of yet there is no algorithm to determine these finite sets in general. In particular, when the curve?s Jacobian rank is equal to or larger than the genus, there are many challenges that remain. In this project, the PI will study methods for explicitly determining the finite set of rational points on curves of genus 2 or more.  The PI will also organize educational activities to build the mathematical pipeline and mentor students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>One promising approach for determining the finite set of rational points on curves of genus 2 or more, regardless of Jacobian rank, is through Kim's nonabelian Chabauty program and the computation of Selmer sets.  Kim has conjectured that Selmer sets in depth n are finite for n sufficiently large, and that moreover, that these Selmer sets eventually precisely cut out the set of rational points.  Several components of the first nonabelian part of this program (i.e., in depth 2) have been made algorithmic by the PI and her collaborators. In this project, the PI proposes a careful study of Selmer sets in depth 2 and 3 for new classes of curves. She will do this by carrying out explicit computations that are motivated by Kim?s conjecture.

This research will begin with a multi-population comparison problem, using a stabilized cross-validation framework, and will then investigate performance guarantees of cross-validation in more general settings. The project will also develop new methods for adaptive population comparisons in high-dimensional and nonparametric regimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Languages differ from one another, but they also show a great deal of variation within themselves. People in different regions or countries often pronounce words in the same language differently. For example, many people in the southern US pronounce the ?i? in words like ?ride? as an ?a? sound (similar to the one found in ?rad?), while most other Americans do not. Most speech-to-text systems?which turn spoken words into written text?focus on just one variety of each language. However, in everyday life, many people speak other varieties. Existing speech-to-text systems often do not work well for these varieties. Improving speech recognition for low-resource varieties represents a business opportunity, one that can help more Americans access voice-powered tools and services. This project takes one step towards this goal. It innovates by leveraging the fact that the differences between various varieties of the same language often follow predictable patterns. For example, since the pronunciations of words in different regions change following rules that apply to the whole vocabulary, one can often predict how a word will be pronounced in one variety if one knows how it is pronounced in another. The project will develop a powerful AI model (POWSM) that can transcribe pronunciation (using a universal system developed by linguists to represent sounds). This approach enables the development of speech-to-text systems for previously unsupported language variants, even when little recorded training data exists for them. It works by learning both the similarities and the systematic differences between well-resourced varieties and others.<br/><br/>The project builds an encoder-decoder foundation speech model called POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model), which is trained to recognize speech as sequences of phones (consonants and vowels) in any language. The project will include three applications using this model: 1) Prompting POWSM with vector representations of the systematic sound correspondences between a low-resource variety (LRV) and a high-resource variety (HRV), enabling the model to recognize the LRV as a transformed variant of the HRV. 2) Constructing stochastic weighted finite-state transducers that can generate synthetic LRV data based on linguist-curated knowledge about sound changes in the HRV and LRV. Using this synthetic data to train a language model that can be used to decode LRV output from POWSM. 3) Learning phonetic correspondences between language varieties automatically from transcribed audio using a novel form of unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction (UBLI) that leverages both text and audio. Audio aligned in this way can be used to train basic speech-to-speech translation models that, when used in conjunction with POWSM, enable speech technologies for LRVs without requiring linguistic annotation beyond transcription. The proposed methods are intended to cover most HRV-LRV scenarios. They will be evaluated on major languages including varieties in English, Italian, Chinese, German, Arabic, German, and Dutch, English, as well as endangered languages like Nahuatl and Mixtec.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current attempts at such printing suffer from a limitation of the printer?s depositing material only in layers parallel to the ground, restricting its application to simple forms and making it incompatible with the production of materially efficient parts that entail complex geometries. This technological limitation is exacerbated by the need for constant human monitoring and tuning of the process to eliminate defects. As a result, current applications are limited to single-family houses with simple geometries that use more concrete, not less, than if manufactured using traditional formwork methods, thus limiting widespread adoption by the industry. This project looks to develop new printing methods that reliably deposit material in complex geometries inherent to materially efficient parts.

Until very recently, experimenters were incapable of measuring materials on fast-enough timescales to see how electrons behave when they are far out of equilibrium before they reach a new steady state. This restriction to studying electrons in materials at or near equilibrium has fundamentally limited understanding of the physical mechanisms governing charge and heat conduction, magnetism, and other topics. In the past decade, developments in ultrafast laser technology have made it possible to study far-from-equilibrium systems of electrons. Apart from isolated examples, however, there is no theoretical framework for interpreting such experiments, i.e., for understanding what they can tell us about the underlying quantum mechanical dynamics of the electrons, or how we can use this knowledge to guide the search for materials with new functionalities. This is the theoretical gap that the present project aims to fill. <br/> <br/>This project has two main thrusts. First, for broad classes of systems ? such as superconductors and thin wires ? the researchers will develop explicit predictions for out-of-equilibrium behavior based on state-of-the-art theoretical descriptions. In materials that exhibit exotic phenomena, there are often multiple theoretical models that agree on what equilibrium behavior looks like, but in general make distinct predictions for out of equilibrium. The researchers will use out-of-equilibrium dynamics as a way for distinguishing between these various models. Also, many fundamental aspects of the physics of complex quantum systems have largely been studied with computer simulations because they have no nontrivial implications for near-equilibrium dynamics. Out of equilibrium, however, such phenomena appear to have concrete and testable implications; the researchers will establish what these implications are, and how they can be unambiguously identified in present-day experiments.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a theoretical framework to exploit new experimental capabilities to yield new insights into quantum materials. Alongside the research, the educational and outreach component of this activity includes the training of students in this new field and the organization of conferences. In addition, the researchers intend to write a monograph on nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, intended to make the dramatic developments that have taken place in this field over the past two decades accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Most current experimental probes of quantum materials employ linear response. Recent experimental developments enable interrogation of materials through nonlinear response, offering a wealth of opportunities for materials characterization, and for resolving fundamental questions that could not be unambiguously settled through linear-response techniques. However, exploiting this opportunity requires a theoretical foundation, which is currently absent. The researchers will develop the necessary theoretical foundation for applying nonlinear response techniques to correlated quantum materials.<br/> <br/>The research consists of three principal thrusts. The first thrust will address both clean and disordered superconductors to investigate how nonlinear response may be used to probe intrinsic lifetimes of excitations, as well as how to use nonlinear response to resolve fundamental questions regarding energy localization. The second thrust will consider one-dimensional systems at low temperatures. Specific problems include how nonlinear response may be used to probe disorder-driven localization in Luttinger liquids, how nonlinear response may be used to characterize the spin incoherent Luttinger liquid (with and without disorder), and nonlinear corrections to Luttinger liquid physics. The third thrust aims at developing a crisp means of characterizing chaos, addressing formal theoretical concepts like eigenstate thermalization, and understanding how nonlinear response could be used to gain insight into strange-metal phases without good quasiparticles.<br/> <br/>In addition to the research, this project will train students in this new field, and disseminate the key developments through conference organization and summer-school lectures. Furthermore, the researchers intend to write a monograph on quantum dynamics. Quantum dynamics has witnessed dramatic advances over the past two decades, yet these advances are scattered across a wide literature. A monograph that collects the key developments in one place will play a key role in making this field accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One challenge is that their bright stellar hosts hinder the detailed characterization of the planets? atmospheres. The discovery of planetary-mass companions (PMCs) on wide orbits has allowed for the study of atmospheres of Jupiter-like exoplanets, serving as analogs for those on closer-in orbits like those of our Solar System giants. A researcher and her team at the University of San Diego has been awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Faculty Catalyst (AFC) Award to observe ongoing gas giant planet formation in wide-orbit planetary-mass, and to design specialized observing modes in anticipation of future instrumentation upgrades. This both expands the types of exoplanets that can be characterized while also laying the groundwork for preparing direct-imaging studies with upcoming 30-m class telescopes. This Award will support four undergraduate summer student researchers as well as two full-time post-baccalaureate student researchers. The researcher will expand the department's physics retention efforts with year-round activities such as professional development, research skills training and career information woven into course offerings, and a near-peer mentoring program within the campus summer research experiences.<br/><br/>Over the course of the AFC award, the proposer will work on two projects. The first is to observe ongoing gas giant planet formation at mid-infrared wavelengths in wide-orbit, PMCs with the Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) during its science demonstration survey post-commissioning on the Keck telescope. The second project is to design specialized higher-resolution observing modes in anticipation of upgrade opportunities with SCALES. The goal is to advance understanding of the origin and evolution of gas giant exoplanets and wide-orbit PMCs. Current theories of planetary accretion suggest the oft-used hydrogen line to total accretion luminosity relationships for low-mass stars may not be appropriate and the PI aims to provide the first constraints on empirical line accretion relationships down to planetary masses. This work will determine whether accretion models need to be adjusted in the low-mass regime, provide additional insight into their accretion processes and place new constraints on mid-infrared protoplanetary accretion tracers. In addition, the principal investigator will advise undergraduate research students and full-time post-baccalaureate students, introduce discipline-specific programmatic structure into campus summer research programs, and develop a research-skills curriculum for introductory physics courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Until very recently, experimenters were incapable of measuring materials on fast-enough timescales to see how electrons behave when they are far out of equilibrium before they reach a new steady state. This restriction to studying electrons in materials at or near equilibrium has fundamentally limited understanding of the physical mechanisms governing charge and heat conduction, magnetism, and other topics. In the past decade, developments in ultrafast laser technology have made it possible to study far-from-equilibrium systems of electrons. Apart from isolated examples, however, there is no theoretical framework for interpreting such experiments, i.e., for understanding what they can tell us about the underlying quantum mechanical dynamics of the electrons, or how we can use this knowledge to guide the search for materials with new functionalities. This is the theoretical gap that the present project aims to fill. <br/> <br/>This project has two main thrusts. First, for broad classes of systems ? such as superconductors and thin wires ? the researchers will develop explicit predictions for out-of-equilibrium behavior based on state-of-the-art theoretical descriptions. In materials that exhibit exotic phenomena, there are often multiple theoretical models that agree on what equilibrium behavior looks like, but in general make distinct predictions for out of equilibrium. The researchers will use out-of-equilibrium dynamics as a way for distinguishing between these various models. Also, many fundamental aspects of the physics of complex quantum systems have largely been studied with computer simulations because they have no nontrivial implications for near-equilibrium dynamics. Out of equilibrium, however, such phenomena appear to have concrete and testable implications; the researchers will establish what these implications are, and how they can be unambiguously identified in present-day experiments.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a theoretical framework to exploit new experimental capabilities to yield new insights into quantum materials. Alongside the research, the educational and outreach component of this activity includes the training of students in this new field and the organization of conferences. In addition, the researchers intend to write a monograph on nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, intended to make the dramatic developments that have taken place in this field over the past two decades accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Most current experimental probes of quantum materials employ linear response. Recent experimental developments enable interrogation of materials through nonlinear response, offering a wealth of opportunities for materials characterization, and for resolving fundamental questions that could not be unambiguously settled through linear-response techniques. However, exploiting this opportunity requires a theoretical foundation, which is currently absent. The researchers will develop the necessary theoretical foundation for applying nonlinear response techniques to correlated quantum materials.<br/> <br/>The research consists of three principal thrusts. The first thrust will address both clean and disordered superconductors to investigate how nonlinear response may be used to probe intrinsic lifetimes of excitations, as well as how to use nonlinear response to resolve fundamental questions regarding energy localization. The second thrust will consider one-dimensional systems at low temperatures. Specific problems include how nonlinear response may be used to probe disorder-driven localization in Luttinger liquids, how nonlinear response may be used to characterize the spin incoherent Luttinger liquid (with and without disorder), and nonlinear corrections to Luttinger liquid physics. The third thrust aims at developing a crisp means of characterizing chaos, addressing formal theoretical concepts like eigenstate thermalization, and understanding how nonlinear response could be used to gain insight into strange-metal phases without good quasiparticles.<br/> <br/>In addition to the research, this project will train students in this new field, and disseminate the key developments through conference organization and summer-school lectures. Furthermore, the researchers intend to write a monograph on quantum dynamics. Quantum dynamics has witnessed dramatic advances over the past two decades, yet these advances are scattered across a wide literature. A monograph that collects the key developments in one place will play a key role in making this field accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Languages differ from one another, but they also show a great deal of variation within themselves. People in different regions or countries often pronounce words in the same language differently. For example, many people in the southern US pronounce the ?i? in words like ?ride? as an ?a? sound (similar to the one found in ?rad?), while most other Americans do not. Most speech-to-text systems?which turn spoken words into written text?focus on just one variety of each language. However, in everyday life, many people speak other varieties. Existing speech-to-text systems often do not work well for these varieties. Improving speech recognition for low-resource varieties represents a business opportunity, one that can help more Americans access voice-powered tools and services. This project takes one step towards this goal. It innovates by leveraging the fact that the differences between various varieties of the same language often follow predictable patterns. For example, since the pronunciations of words in different regions change following rules that apply to the whole vocabulary, one can often predict how a word will be pronounced in one variety if one knows how it is pronounced in another. The project will develop a powerful AI model (POWSM) that can transcribe pronunciation (using a universal system developed by linguists to represent sounds). This approach enables the development of speech-to-text systems for previously unsupported language variants, even when little recorded training data exists for them. It works by learning both the similarities and the systematic differences between well-resourced varieties and others.<br/><br/>The project builds an encoder-decoder foundation speech model called POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model), which is trained to recognize speech as sequences of phones (consonants and vowels) in any language. The project will include three applications using this model: 1) Prompting POWSM with vector representations of the systematic sound correspondences between a low-resource variety (LRV) and a high-resource variety (HRV), enabling the model to recognize the LRV as a transformed variant of the HRV. 2) Constructing stochastic weighted finite-state transducers that can generate synthetic LRV data based on linguist-curated knowledge about sound changes in the HRV and LRV. Using this synthetic data to train a language model that can be used to decode LRV output from POWSM. 3) Learning phonetic correspondences between language varieties automatically from transcribed audio using a novel form of unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction (UBLI) that leverages both text and audio. Audio aligned in this way can be used to train basic speech-to-speech translation models that, when used in conjunction with POWSM, enable speech technologies for LRVs without requiring linguistic annotation beyond transcription. The proposed methods are intended to cover most HRV-LRV scenarios. They will be evaluated on major languages including varieties in English, Italian, Chinese, German, Arabic, German, and Dutch, English, as well as endangered languages like Nahuatl and Mixtec.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technologies based on deep learning or deep neural networks have proven to be especially effective at learning from vast quantities of data, and yet our theoretical understanding of these tools has lagged behind. As we rely more on neural-network systems in our daily lives, it becomes even more important that we can guarantee their safety and reliability. One failure mode of current systems is that they can be confidently incorrect, and this can cause real-world harm. It would be better if our systems ""know what they don't know"" by maintaining an internal representation of their own uncertainty. In recent years, progress has been made in the mathematical study of ""calibration"" and ""multicalibration,"" which establish a mathematical framework for uncertainty, probability, and fairness in problems having to do with categorical prediction such as classifiers and recommender systems. The goal of this project is to port these ideas into perceptual domains such as image or video processing. This project will result in the creation of new general-purpose neural networks for image-processing based on a new mathematical principle of learning ""calibrated representations"" of images, resulting in general-purpose systems that effectively ""know what they don't know."" This will enable more robust and reliable image-processing applications across wide sectors of research and technology.<br/><br/>Representation-learning is a challenging area of machine learning (ML) in which the goal is not to solve any particular task, but to learn ? from unlabeled and minimally-structured data ? to form a representation or embedding vector of the data that will turn out to be useful, robust, and generalizeable in a variety of downstream tasks. Recent progress in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has produced embedding models that begin to rival task-specific models in areas like vision and language-processing. However, SSL is an area where empirical results have consistently outpaced theoretical understanding, making some SSL models susceptible to surprising failure-modes. The next generation of representation-learning methods must build on the success of current methods while establishing firmer theoretical foundations. This project advances such a foundation in terms of probability and uncertainty quantification. The key idea is to draw on the recent development of ""multicalibration,"" which provides theoretical guarantees for trustworthy and fair classifiers. However, multicalibration in its existing form is only applicable to supervised learning tasks where labels or regression targets are known. First, this project extends multicalibration to weakly-structured but unlabeled data, where it gives rise to a constrained optimization objective. This then naturally leads to a set of self-consistency constraints on the outputs of a representation-learning or embedding model. These self-consistency constraints closely resemble the kinds of heuristic learning objectives that have been empirically successful in SSL. This project therefore aims to design and train embedding models with new self-consistency constraints derived from (multi)calibration. The theoretical contribution will be to place SSL methods on more solid theoretical footing, namely by establishing a connection to probabilistic inference and representations of uncertainty. The practical contribution will be to create and release more trustworthy and robust embedding models to serve as a foundation for general downstream visual tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are known to be coming from galaxies outside our own and are now a highly intense area of astrophysical pursuit, with over a thousand FRBs detected to date.  A research team between the University of California Santa Cruz, Northwestern University and the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) forms the core of the Fast and Fortunate for FRB Follow-up (F4) team, which has been funded by the NSF since 2019 to observe FRBs and associate them with their host galaxies. This has enabled the team to start to use FRB signals to probe the universe and to make a new census of the baryons (subatomic particles, mostly protons and neutrons) in a highly diffuse state outside of galaxies throughout the universe.  This current NSF award extends this work to allow F4 to increase its observational impact by an order of magnitude through follow-up observations of two new surveys of precisely localized FRBs, allowing them to study cosmology, baryon distribution and identify FRB progenitors.  This award will also support students in a postbaccalaureate 'Bridge' program hosted at the MMO for attracting and retaining talented and traditionally underrepresented students, with a long-term goal of increasing their participation and leadership in STEM fields.  All of the investigators will engage in the many outreach activities of the MMO.<br/><br/>During the period of this grant, the F4 team will acquire, analyze, and disseminate deep, multi-band imaging and spectroscopy on the host galaxies of hundreds of FRBs across the sky. For many tens of FRB fields, they will obtain imaging and multi-object spectroscopy to identify intervening galactic halos and map the foreground large-scale structure. These data and derived quantities (e.g. redshifts (z) and stellar masses), together with measurements of the FRBs (e.g. dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM)) will enable three major scientific thrusts: (1) cosmology: the first statistically robust determination of the Macquart relation (DM vs. z), leading to a new and complementary estimate of the Hubble parameter; (2) galaxy formation: inferring the radial distribution of baryons in galactic halos and constraining the magnetic fields and gas density of the circumgalactic medium; and (3) FRB progenitors: testing the many models invoked to produce FRBs and using rapid follow-up imaging at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths to resolve FRB emission mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they struggle in unstructured, dynamic, real-world settings that demand adaptability and autonomy -- challenges that humans handle with ease. Humans excel at abstract reasoning,  allowing them to perform complex tasks without constant attention to low-level details. This research project aims to equip robots with similar capabilities, enabling them to learn abstract representations of their environment and actions through experience. By enhancing the ability of robotic agents to plan and execute tasks in real world settings, this research could drive advancements in automation, assistive care, and disaster response. Additionally, the project intends to contribute to STEM education through outreach programs for high school students and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The findings will be disseminated through leading robotics conferences and peer-reviewed journals, ensuring broad visibility within the research community. Moreover, the results will inform and enhance robotics courses and all software and datasets produced will be openly shared, fostering collaboration and further advancements in the field.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance robotic manipulation in unstructured environments by enabling robots to autonomously learn abstract representations of states and actions from sensory and execution data. Existing planning methods have been successful in controlled settings by using task planners to reason abstractly about complex tasks, providing reliability, explainability, and transparency. However, they rely on human-specified representations, which are impractical in real-world scenarios with unknown objects and noisy sensor data. In contrast, purely data-driven approaches can learn directly from raw sensor data, reducing the need for manual specification but struggling with generalization and lacking interpretability, limiting their deployment in dynamic environments. Research funded by this award seeks to address these issues by developing a framework that learns abstract state and action representations from experience and seamlessly incorporating them into existing manipulation planners. Research activities will focus on designing methods for autonomous real-world data collection, designing algorithms to extract structured representations, and adapting decision-making strategies to leverage learned abstractions. Experimental validation will be conducted on real-world robotic platforms to assess the effectiveness of the learned abstractions. If successful, this research will enhance robotic adaptability, transparency, and efficiency that could significantly expand applicability of autonomous manipulation in open-world environments such as household tasks, assistive care, and construction. Robots capable of abstract reasoning will be better equipped to handle long-horizon tasks like rearrangement, packaging, and sorting. The results will be disseminated through leading robotics conferences and peer-reviewed journals, with software and datasets openly shared to support further research and educational initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the necessary rise of QIS, an important challenge in undergraduate STEM education is understanding how university students make sense of the foundational interconnectedness of mathematics in quantum, and how professors can best facilitate both deep physical and mathematical understanding in quantum instruction to ensure that all students succeed in their degree programs and have access to the quantum workforce. The purpose of the Student Understanding of Linear Algebra across Quantum Information Science project is to conduct fundamental basic research regarding student understanding at the intersection of mathematics and quantum information science across disciplines. This project has the potential to benefit society by increasing what is known about students' interdisciplinary understanding of mathematics and quantum information science, generating insight into student cognition that will be relevant to subject matter, courses, and disciplines across STEM beyond those directly investigated in the project. Results have the potential to inform best practices in QIS instruction, which in turn, supports the growth of the quantum workforce--a workforce that is increasingly critical to international competitiveness in information technology during the coming century.<br/><br/>The project research questions are: How do students understand various linear algebra concepts that are central to quantum information science concepts across disciplines? How do students reason about and symbolize linear algebra concepts in coordination with quantum information science concepts across disciplines? These questions are pursued through qualitative analyses of interviews conducted with and written work collected from students enrolled in four QIS-focused courses that are part of an interdisciplinary Quantum Information Science and Engineering minor. These four courses include a lower-division and an upper-division physics course, a chemistry course, and a computer science course. Each of the four courses relies on a similar throughline of core linear algebra concepts, such as linear combination, matrix equations and linear operators, unitary and Hermitian matrices, orthonormality, basis and change of basis, inner product, and tensor product, and eigentheory, as well as Dirac notation and matrix notation. Data analyses will aim to characterize students' meanings for these linear algebra concepts, as well as how students leverage linear algebra in their understanding of quantum topics such as qubits and entanglement. Thus, answering the project research questions will produce explanatory, research-based knowledge about how humans make sense of core mathematical concepts and their interconnectedness with QIS beyond disciplinary lines, in contexts that underly STEM in the modern world.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study how microplastics move through soil and water and interact with potentially toxic chemicals, such as chlorinated ethenes and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The research will explore the fate of microplastics in the environment by conducting a series of laboratory experiments of increasing scale and complexity under conditions that mimic those of contaminated sites. Results of the project will advance scientific knowledge that can be used to protect public health, remediate contaminated sites, and protect water supplies. <br/><br/>Although the interactions between microplastics and halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) are recognized, fate and transport and risk models do not capture the critical roles and dynamics of these interactions. This CAREER project aims to address these critical gaps by exploring the fate and transport of microplastics and their interactions with the associated adsorbed HOCs in soil and groundwater environments. The specific objectives are to: (1) evaluate the impacts of aged and weathered microplastics on HOC adsorption and kinetics; (2) assess the impacts of weathering and aging of HOC-adsorber microplastics on HOCs biotransformation, and resolve how microbial community composition differs at the microplastic and soil interface; (3) evaluate the effects of flow (e.g., simulated rainfall events) on the fate and transport of microplastics and adsorbed HOCs in the unsaturated zone and at the water table; and (4) create programs to disseminate knowledge about the impact of HOCs and microplastics on water quality. The project will generate critical data for improving mathematical transport models and conceptual site models, leading to more representative risk and exposure predictions. Additionally, the project will provide valuable insights into the potential for soil and subsurface microbial communities to affect the fate of microplastics and HOCs.

In fact, it is one of the earliest features of ecology that students learn in school. This structure, despite its ubiquity, has not always been in place. Three hundred million years ago, during the Permian Period, carnivores were the dominant dietary ecology and herbivores were exceptionally rare. At some point, likely during the Permian, a key shift occurred from the carnivore-dominated ecosystem to the herbivore-dominated environments observed today. The fossil record of Oklahoma, which includes the most diverse and best-preserved fossil vertebrate assemblage from the Paleozoic, offers an exceptional opportunity to explore this change. The goals of this project are to track the evolution of herbivory in different tetrapod clades and assess the patterns and processes that lead to it becoming the foundational dietary ecology of terrestrial environments today. This project will directly support Oklahoma graduate and undergraduate students through scientific and technical skills training, as well as broader institutions by utilizing understudied resources, such as the vertebrate faunal collections at the University of Central Oklahoma and the Sam Noble Museum, Oklahoma?s Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>The establishment of the modern terrestrial ecosystem structure represents a profound ecological transition in vertebrate history. To evaluate the tempo and mode of this change, this research will 3D scan the teeth from Permian fossil vertebrates recovered primarily from Oklahoma. Subsequently, this work will use the 3D scans to quantify dental complexity, which directly relates to diet in living mammals and saurians, using the Orientation Patch Count Rotated method. The quantification of tooth shape permits direct comparison of dissimilar shapes from a wide variety of vertebrates and will elucidate the strategies that different clades took to consume plants. Changes in dental shape, complexity, and disparity will be evaluated through deep time to elucidate the ecological changes that occurred through the Permian Period. This research seeks to identify when herbivory became the critical diet of terrestrial systems, how different groups varied in their approach to consuming plants, and what strategies were most successful.

Despite recent advancements in deep learning (DL), which have demonstrated high performance in the automatic diagnosis and interpretation of medical conditions from ECG signals,  the real-world use of these models in healthcare remains limited. This is due to several key challenges, such as the lack of sufficient data for rare but clinically important heart conditions, the difficulty of understanding how these ?black-box? models make decisions, and the absence of explanations that align with the diagnostic reasoning of clinical experts. This project seeks to overcome these challenges in collaboration with clinicians to build DL systems that can generate synthetic ECG signals for rare cases, enhance diagnostic reliability by identifying instances of model uncertainty, and produce comprehensive explanation reports that reflect the clinical workflow of ECG diagnosis. These explanations are intended to assist clinicians in understanding the reasoning behind deep-learning model decisions, thereby increasing trust and usability in real clinical settings. The  results of this research are expected to improve the quality and transparency of DL-based decision support systems, enrich training for future healthcare professionals through tools that align with their diagnostic processes, and broaden access to accurate and interpretable diagnostic technologies.<br/><br/>This project aims to facilitate the integration of deep learning models for Electrocardiograms(ECG)-based detection and monitoring of cardiac conditions by addressing the predominant challenges of data shortage for rare conditions, lack of alignment and interpretation with clinician diagnostic processes, and model uncertainty. This project will address four fundamental research challenges: 1) Multimodal learning: jointly learning signal-feature embedding space for controlled generation of synthetic ECG signals based on SCP statements, 2) Model uncertainty: dynamic and fluid prototypical spaces for improved reliability through abstention reducing false positives and negatives, 3) Rare ECG data: controlled ECG signal generation from SCP-ECG (Standard Communications Protocol) statements to alleviate data challenges, and 4) Clinically-aligned explanations: generation of comprehensive clinical and technical contextual, counterfactual, and contrastive explanations for classification outcomes. These four research aims will be complemented by clinical collaborators to ensure translation in real-world clinical settings and dissemination in the clinical community. The outcomes are anticipated to facilitate the integration of interpretable and reliable deep learning systems into clinical settings, paving the way for future integration of other 1D time-series signals in clinical workflow alignment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As large machine learning models become increasingly essential across science and industry, their substantial resource demands, particularly memory, computation, and energy, have limited their deployment to expensive, specialized hardware. Lossy compression techniques, such as sparsification and quantization, have emerged as solutions for running these models on consumer devices, such as laptops and smartphones. However, these methods often reduce predictive accuracy and require extensive tuning. This project proposes an approach to address this accuracy-efficacy trade-off by building self-aware machine learning models over lossy compression. By enabling models to detect and adapt to their own compression, this project will unlock pathways for cost-effective machine learning model inference.<br/><br/>Technically, the project consists of two core research objectives. The first focuses on developing machine learning models capable of self-awareness in response to lossy compression. This includes enabling models to determine whether they have been compressed, identify the type of compression used, and localize the affected components. The second objective leverages this self-awareness to recover and enhance model performance without retraining. Techniques include instruction-based recovery, sparse zeroth-order optimization that adjusts a small subset of model parameters, and a collaborative inference framework where multiple compressed models work together. The project will evaluate these methods on real-world tasks such as long-context language modeling and biomedical question answering. By addressing fundamental limitations in compressed machine learning model inference, this project will contribute practical tools for efficient machine learning model deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, solving these RITC-PDEs accurately and efficiently over a long time period remains computationally challenging due to their non-equilibrium nature and the need to preserve thermodynamic properties at the discrete level. This project will develop a general computational framework to solve RITC-PDEs while maintaining their energy conservation and nonnegative entropy production for long-time dynamic simulations and predictions. The proposed research will lead to a unified computational framework for studying multiscale non-equilibrium phenomena across various scientific disciplines, along with open-source tools for the broader research community.

They are essential for modeling coupled processes involving energy-conserving(reversible, dispersive) and entropy-producing (irreversible, dissipative) dynamics. This project will develop high-order, accurate, efficient, easy-to-implement, and structure-preserving numerical schemes that maintain thermodynamic properties for RITC-PDEs. Specifically, the project will (a) design innovative structure-preserving discretization methods, including decoupled and high-order schemes, to accurately simulate complex RITC systems while maintaining their inherent thermodynamic consistency; (b) develop advanced time-stepping algorithms that ensure efficiency and accuracy for multiscale dynamics, by leveraging system properties such as energy budgets, entropy production, and topological changes to guide adaptive time step sizes; (c) construct a structure-preserving model order reduction framework that can generate reliable surrogate models for large-scale RITC systems; and (d) implement an open-source software package for simulating RITC-PDEs with GPU acceleration, adaptive meshing, and user-defined model inputs.

This project advances science and technology by developing methods to measure and control memorization in text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which are widely used in social networks, citation networks, and biological systems. While memorization in machine learning can enhance recall of frequently used information, it also raises concerns related to privacy and security. Existing research lacks a comprehensive framework for evaluating and regulating memorization in text-attributed graphs, particularly concerning how graph structures influence memorization patterns. This project will establish new techniques for assessing memorization, develop methods for dynamically adjusting memorization levels, and create the first benchmark for studying memorization effects in text-attributed graph-based learning. These innovations will strengthen the reliability, privacy, and interpretability of AI models used in critical applications such as healthcare, cybersecurity, and knowledge discovery. By ensuring that AI models can retain useful information while preventing unintended leaks of sensitive data, this work will contribute to the development and deployment of responsible AI technologies.<br/><br/>This project develops a rigorous framework for measuring and controlling memorization in TAGs through three key research thrusts. The first thrust introduces a novel dynamic prompting strategy that adapts to input variability, enabling more precise measurement of memorization rates. The second thrust proposes a new dynamic pruning framework that allows for fine-grained control over memorization, ensuring that models can be optimized for either enhanced recall or increased privacy. The third thrust establishes a benchmark for memorization in TAGs, systematically evaluating how memorization is influenced by graph topology, such as node connectivity and long-distance relationships. The project?s methodologies integrate insights from graph neural networks and large language models, bridging gaps in understanding between structured and unstructured data representations. By addressing fundamental challenges in memorization, this research will provide practical tools and insights that benefit AI developers, regulatory bodies, and industries that rely on trustworthy machine learning models.

In societies with a diverse population, many people are not proficient in the majority language. People with less majority-language proficiency face challenges communicating their needs in daily activities such as medical consultations, discussing workplace benefits with employers, exploring housing, and others. A typical solutions pairs these individuals with professional interpreters or bilingual volunteers. Such support is often expensive and unsustainable. To fill the gap, this project will develop innovative tools based on AI Large Language Models (LLMs) to help people advance their language abilities for effective information seeking. Users without technical expertise in computers or AI will be guided to design their own personalized tutoring systems. The resulting digital tutor will assist its user in creating learning plans, practicing strategies, and tracking their progress in advancing their language proficiency. The study will generate rich data, metrics, and benchmarks for language learning for real-life information-seeking practices. The project will advance the science of human-computer interaction, language science and education, and natural language processing. The process of designing and using their own digital tutor will increase user's understanding of AI (AI literacy), and both the power and limitations of LLMs. The tutoring systems will assist users in navigating various information-seeking scenarios, ultimately improving the person's language proficiency and quality of life.<br/><br/>This project provides a novel approach to tackling the challenges faced by people with less majority-language proficiency. They will go through a process wherein they a) design, utilize, and refine an AI-enabled tutoring system that guides their language use for situational purposes, and b) advance their language proficiency along a learning path tailored by themselves to their needs. The experience will stimulate the individual's critical thinking regarding actions to take at the different stages of their language learning. Using the system provides the individual with feedback to adjust their learning to improve outcomes. There are four sets of research activities involved in the lifecycle of this project. Activity 1 employs experience sampling to pinpoint individuals' current practices and challenges in language use for daily information seeking. It help pinpoint the user's essential needs in fine-grained manner. Activity 2 compiles a bank of system building blocks, setting the stage for each individual-as-designer's assembly and customization of their tutoring system. Activity 3 engages each individual-as-learner-and-designer in crafting, using, and refining their tutoring system. It will generate longitudinal data to track the progress of a person's language use in daily information seeking, as well as their coordination with the tutoring system. Activity 4 initiates an open data program to uncover value trade-offs in interactions between participants and large language models.

Effectively reasoning over knowledge graphs to extract meaningful insights and uncover novel connections, is crucial for addressing multifaceted national challenges and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration. However, current KG reasoning methods face significant challenges related to reliability, sustainability, and extensibility. Reliability issues arise due to varying amounts and qualities of available data across different KGs, resulting in inconsistent reasoning outcomes. Sustainability is compromised by the continual evolution of knowledge graphs, which traditionally requires costly and inefficient model retraining whenever new information emerges. Additionally, extensibility remains a critical limitation, as existing reasoning models cannot easily or rapidly adapt to newly developed knowledge graphs, requiring extensive computational resources and hindering timely deployment. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating a continual collaborative framework specifically designed for practical, real-world scenarios. The proposed framework will enable reasoning models to incrementally integrate new information, collaboratively share insights across multiple domains while ensuring data privacy and quickly adapt to new KGs. By addressing the critical issues, the project will contribute to the advancement of open knowledge networks, promoting their development in a manner that ensures reliability, sustainability, and extensibility. These improvements will strengthen existing reasoning approaches and enhance their ability to serve as a vital component of the nation's infrastructure.<br/><br/>The continual collaborative framework faces two significant challenges: the challenge of catastrophic forgetting and the challenge of effective and robust knowledge transfer. To overcome these challenges, the project proposes two thrusts. The first thrust aims to enable continual local updating of knowledge graph reasoning models. The team will address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when continually updating KG reasoning models by preserving a set of representative data for rehearsal during subsequent continual updates. For novel emerging data, the team will design a synergistic solution combining prompt tuning and model modulation to tackle knowledge collision and facilitate knowledge integration. The second thrust aims to build an extensible collaborative framework for knowledge graph reasoning. The team will target the challenge of effective and robust knowledge transfer in a collaborative environment where multiple KG reasoning models share knowledge through prompt consolidation and inter-model transfer. To customize reasoning model parameters for emerging KGs, a conditional generative framework will be employed to learn the distribution of parameters from existing reasoning models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To obtain solutions that translate best into real-world settings, these problems should involve models of the real world that are as accurate as possible, which in a mathematical context means that the problems may need to involve a large number of decision variables and complicated formulas with features such as nonsmoothness.  Thanks to the thriving field of mathematical optimization, there exist algorithmic methodologies for solving certain instances of problems of this type.  However, contemporary methodologies also have limitations that preclude their use for solving complex problems robustly and efficiently.  for example, it may be that with respect to an objective that is optimized, only the consequences of a certain set of decisions can be estimated (in terms of a cost, error, or other measure).  This can occur, when the value can only be determined through a computer simulation or as a statistical prediction over only partially observed data.  Such a context demands that contemporary approaches be extended so that they can intelligently handle noisy or stochastic (i.e., randomized) estimates of the value of decisions.  This project aims to design such algorithmic extensions for solving important classes of optimization problems arising in these prevalent and challenging application areas.<br/><br/>This project will involve the design, analysis, and implementation of gradient-sampling-based algorithms for solving locally Lipschitz optimization problems, specifically those that have nonconvex and nonsmooth objective functions.  The main scope of the project is to extend contemporary gradient-sampling-based algorithms for settings when function and derivative evaluations are corrupted by computational and/or stochastic noise.  In settings with such noise, fundamental properties on which gradient-sampling methods rely for their convergence guarantees break down, meaning that these fundamental properties need to be revisited and enhanced for settings with computational and/or stochastic noise.  These, in turn, will necessitate careful redesigns of complete algorithmic methodologies along with their corresponding convergence theories.  The real-world impact of the project will be enhanced by the fact that it will translate into enhancements to the state-of-the-art software developed by the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process generates ocean crust and is responsible for most of the volcanic eruptions on Earth. The presence of even small amounts of water in the mantle is known to have large effects on the amount of magma produced. Likewise, small changes in chemical composition of the mantle rocks will also change the amount of magma produced. This project will be the first to study both of these factors together. The project involves both laboratory experiments that replicate the conditions in the mantle and computational models that predict melting. Two graduate students will conduct each aspect of the project, respectively, but also will be cross-trained under the guidance of principle investigators. Several first-year undergraduates will also be involved in the research, leveraging an existing program at the University of Utah. The anticipated outcome of this research will be the first models that accurately predict the combined effect of water and composition variations on mantle melting. The project will also support making video tutorials to help with the adoption of the software developed in this project.<br/><br/>The presence of even small amounts of water and other volatiles can significantly alter the way that mantle rocks melt and how much magma is produced to form new crust and create volcanoes. Understanding the mantle melting processes from the composition of basalts produced is a very difficult problem, so laboratory experiments and computational modeling provide the best ways to address these questions. This project integrates high pressure-high temperature laboratory experiments and geochemical numerical models to investigate the impacts of variable water content on melting of a realistic mantle composition containing both peridotites and pyroxenites as they coexist in a decompressing, rising mantle plume. The project will develop the first model parameterization that can accurately predict the effects of water on melting a lithologically realistic mantle containing pyroxenites, and make publicly available open-source software to enable other researchers to run these models. The central hypothesis is that increasing both the abundance of pyroxenite and the concentration of water in the decompressing mantle will generate measurably deeper melting than either factor alone. Experimental data generated during the project will add significantly to the public Library of Experimental Phase Relations and the EarthChem national data repository. This project will enable two graduate students to continue their studies and will provide first-hand research experiences for freshmen students at University of Utah.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research on minimax problems dates back almost a century, when von Neumann published his minimax theorem about zero-sum games. The past several years have witnessed tremendous research interest in solving minimax problems, motivated by training deep learning models, including generative artificial intelligence and robust machine learning. Though well-trained deep learning models can deliver high-quality performance in many tasks, they are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Using such models can cause serious safety and security risks; thus, improving their robustness is very important. Most existing methods for solving minimax problems require certain strong conditions that do not hold for modern applications, such as training robust deep learning models. This project will develop new optimization algorithms for solving minimax problems, which can deliver guaranteed stability and reliability under weaker and more practical conditions. Software packages will be developed and released for public use to benefit both academic and industry researchers. The results from the project will be integrated into regularly offered or topical courses at RPI for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Different algorithms will be designed by leveraging the structures of the considered minimax problems, and analysis will be conducted as well to show the convergence of these algorithms and their complexity. For solving nonconvex nonsmooth minimax problems that satisfy a certain regularity condition for the dual part, a momentum-accelerated primal-dual stochastic subgradient method (PDSsG) will be investigated, and a Moreau-envelope based smoothed PDSsG, as an alternative, will also be explored. For solving nonconvex-nonconcave nonsmooth minimax problems that do not satisfy regularity conditions, new approaches will be developed by using the log-exponential smoothing function to approximate the maximization part. On solving problems that involve too-big data, new distributed methods will be designed under the setting of either a complete network or an incomplete connected network. Low-precision communication and error-compensation techniques will be used, for the first time, to solve nonconvex minimax problems, to save communication, and achieve fast convergence. These investigations are expected to invent new analysis techniques and lead to novel and efficient algorithms for solving large-scale minimax structured optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In structural graph theory, the goal is to understand the large-scale behavior of graphs whose local behavior is somehow restricted. This project focuses on developing structural techniques for dense graphs, that is, graphs with many connections. The PI will focus on two ways of restricting the local behavior: by forbidding a vertex-minor, and by asking for a dependent first-order theory. These restrictions have applications to other domains such as quantum computing, algorithms and complexity, discrete geometry, and extremal combinatorics. Graduate students will be trained as part of the project.<br/><br/>This project will develop structural techniques for dense classes of graphs, focusing on classes with a forbidden vertex-minor or a dependent first-order theory. For classes with a forbidden vertex-minor, the goal is to obtain a complete understanding of the structure relative to a tour graph. This will be a key step towards proving a conjecture of Geelen, which would give a very precise structural description of graphs with a forbidden vertex-minor. For classes with a dependent first-order theory, the focus is on a well-known dichotomy conjecture. This conjecture roughly states that for classes that are closed under vertex deletion, having a dependent first-order theory is equivalent to admitting an efficient algorithm for checking the first-order properties of graphs in the class.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluid flows such as gases are important in nature. Their study is crucial for understanding the dynamics in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, including gas dynamics, material science, geometry, turbulence, and shell theory. While one-dimensional problems in this field are relatively well understood, the theory for multi-dimensional cases remains mathematically underdeveloped. This project seeks to advance the mathematical understanding of multi-dimensional conservation laws and their applications in both fluid dynamics and geometry, and will integrate research and education, therefore also contributing to the development of the future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The research will focus on four core problems: (1) the existence and stability of the transonic contact discontinuity in the three-dimensional axisymmetric nozzle in gas dynamics: this is a free boundary and mixed-type problem, the free boundary is characteristic, and this study will shed light and provide new methods on the general multi-dimensional theory of conservation laws; (2) the existence of a global solution to the transonic flow past a three-dimensional axisymmetric cone in gas dynamics: new ideas and techniques will be developed to solve this mixed-type PDE problem; and  (3) the global smooth solution to the Gauss-Codazzi equations of isometric immersion of surfaces: a global smooth solution to the underlying hyperbolic system of balance laws yields a smooth isometric immersion of surfaces, and a longstanding open problem is to find such a global smooth solution when the curvature of the surface has the optimal decay rate and oscillations. By developing novel analytic methods for these important problems, the project will deepen understanding of multi-dimensional PDEs in fluid dynamics and geometry.

Beadwork is not only visually captivating but also mechanically fascinating. As a metamaterial, its mechanical properties arise from not just the materials used but also its structure. Fabricated by weaving thread through beads, beadwork combines complementary characteristics of textiles and granular matter into one material. For example, like textiles, beadwork is programmable to various shapes and like granular matter beadwork can rearrange to resist high loads. This work will explore the relationship between beadwork design and its mechanical properties. Insights from this work will not only promote the progress of science but also enable the use of beadwork as material in applications that advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. For example, new technologies that require materials with varied properties such as soft robotics, wearable tech, and deployable structures. This CAREER award also supports integrated educational activities designed to broaden resources, perspectives, and participation at the intersection of STEAM disciplines of mechanical engineering, physics, and craft. Working towards developing a pipeline for the next generation of STEAM researchers and workforce, these activities include a graduate course on craft mechanics, online STEM-beadwork resources, instructor training, and K-12 STEM programming using beadwork. The award will directly drive these activities as beadwork is implemented in learning modules, hands-on demonstrations, and research opportunities.<br/><br/>As a composite material system, beadwork combines mechanics of slender structures and packed grains, enabling them with programmatic design, tensile actuation, and extremely tunable stiffness. This CAREER project will support experiments on beadwork metamaterials to explore these and other emergent properties and develop predictive models that describe beadwork?s key mechanical and geometric features. In particular, the objective is to investigate the beadwork?s mechanical response to internal and external action, expected to be characterized by nonlinear deformation, internal contact and friction, fracture, and instability. In a gradual research approach, simpler, periodic two-dimensional designs to more complex three-dimensional configurations will be considered. Bead level material behavior, kinematics, and forces will be theorized and connected to effective structural response. Homogenization schemes based on lumped masses/energy will be used in developing approximate but efficient predictive models. The desktop-scale experimental platform for testing concepts in this project will be useful in related fields that encode tessellations. For example, beadwork shares concepts of topology and geometry that are used in the computer graphics community for developing meshes as well as in nanoscale chemistry with carbon nanostructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal is to improve Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology, which produces electricity from sunlight. As the world faces increasing energy demands, more renewable energy solutions are being developed, including CSP. However, CSP has a challenge: it relies on sunlight, which is an intermittent energy source. This makes it hard to use CSP all the time. To solve this, scientists are working on ways to store heat energy so it can be used when the sun isn?t shining. One promising solution is TCES, which allows CSP plants to store heat at high temperatures and release it when needed. This project will focus on developing and testing DCM materials to create the best possible heat storage solution. It will also help students who work on the project improve their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, preparing them for future careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Currently, CSP plants use molten salt-based heat energy storage systems, but their low decomposition temperatures (600 to 650°C) limit plant efficiency by capping the operating temperatures of the power generation cycle. TCES leverages the heat generated from a reversible chemical reaction that facilitates the reduction (charging step) and re-oxidation (discharging step) of metal oxides such as DCMs. Compared to sensible heat energy storage, TCES possesses a substantially higher energy density and a more extended storage period. In this project, DCMs will be synthesized using the solution combustion synthesis approach by co-doping both the Ca and Mn sites with suitable metal cations. The primary objective is to attain a TCES capacity of greater than 500 kJ/kg within the optimal temperature range of CSP systems (700 to 1200°C). The design of DCMs will emphasize achieving superior enthalpy of reduction, extent of redox reactions, and cyclability, directly contributing to the attainment of the maximum TCES capacity. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analysis will provide theoretical insights into the potential of DCMs concerning oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). Detailed characterization of DCMs will allow correlating their physical and chemical attributes with their ability to facilitate the redox reactions in TCES.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research looks to enable real-time adaptation of autonomous systems to unexpected disruptions, with potential applications to power grids and robotics. Autonomous systems have become increasingly complex, integrating advanced decision-making algorithms to operate in dynamic and uncertain environments, while the sources of disruptions have grown even more diverse and unpredictable. However, current control algorithms lack the ability to correctly categorize and respond to different types of unexpected disruptions, such as sensor noise, mechanical malfunctions, environmental disturbances, or adversarial cyber-attacks without human intervention, leading to performance degradation and potential failures. This research project looks to address this critical gap by developing a unified framework that enables autonomous systems to detect, classify, and mitigate disruptions in real time through game-theoretic modeling and reinforcement learning control strategies. By equipping autonomous systems with the capability to respond dynamically without human intervention, this research seeks to enhance their resilience, efficiency, and safety in other high-stakes applications such as intelligent transportation systems, space exploration, and disaster response. Additionally, this project seeks to contribute to workforce development by integrating research with education, providing interdisciplinary training in artificial intelligence and control systems, and engaging students through outreach and STEM initiatives aimed at expanding the engineering and technology workforce.<br/><br/>This project looks to model complex autonomous systems as multi-agent systems, where different components collaborate to achieve a common objective. When a disruption occurs, the affected component is treated as an irrational agent within the system. Passive irrational agents represent faults caused by external disturbances, while active irrational agents exhibit adversarial behavior, such as cyber-attacks. While traditional fault mitigation methods treat all disturbances as adversarial, this research introduces a cooperative index to measure deviations from expected behavior and employs inverse reinforcement learning to distinguish between passive and active irrational agents for improved joint rewards. To ensure optimal system adaptation, the project seeks to develop a novel Actor-Critic-Friend-or-Foe (ACFoF) algorithm, which dynamically updates control policies while maintaining system performance. The researched framework could offer a groundbreaking approach to autonomous disruption detection and mitigation, enhancing the reliability of autonomous systems in critical applications. Additionally, the research supports educational initiatives by providing interdisciplinary training opportunities for students in artificial intelligence, control systems, and cybersecurity, preparing the next generation of researchers and engineers to tackle challenges in autonomous decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The brain contributes computational intelligence, while the body provides mechanical intelligence. Integrating these elements?computational and mechanical intelligence?into the concept of mechano-computation represents a frontier in both robotics and neuroscience research. Progress in this field necessitates interdisciplinary communication and collaboration across various scientific domains. To propel this promising field forward, the Mechano-computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH) Network aims to unite diverse researchers from robotics, mechanics, materials science, neuroscience, information theory, biology, engineering design, and applied mathematics. Through workshops, travel grants, and the facilitation of collaborative projects, this network seeks to stimulate interdisciplinary dialogue, develop rigorous metrics for assessing autonomous systems, train the next generation of researchers, and push the boundaries of research in all areas of mechano-computation. By establishing a centralized resource for sharing findings, benchmarks, and methodologies, this network of researchers can accelerate innovation and position the United States as a leader in this transformative field, laying the groundwork for enhanced robotic systems in healthcare, agriculture, forestry, national security, and beyond. It may be argued that the full potential of robotics will not be realized until an intelligent physical body is purposefully designed from the outset, with careful consideration of both the available computational intelligence and the affordances the body can provide?affordances that, if appropriately leveraged, can offload and simplify computational demands by enabling efficient, embodied solutions to complex tasks.<br/><br/>The Mechano-computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH) Network will bring together leading experts to tackle these critical challenges in autonomous systems through the integration of mechanical and computational intelligence. Creating intentional mechano-computation will enhance the design and control of autonomous systems, making them more efficient and explainable, and it will contribute to the development of innovative materials, mechanisms, and control strategies, pushing the boundaries of current research.

This research will look to estimate wind loads on a variety of low-rise structures by establishing a machine learning (ML) framework to complement physical wind tunnel testing. Due to high costs of physical experiments in laboratories, peak wind loading on buildings are difficult to quantify using wind tunnel tests alone. Uncertainties in the estimation of peak wind effects on cladding elements can render design provisions unrealistic and cause building envelope failure and water intrusion. The ML framework looks to generate the necessary information for advancing wind design for low-rise building communities. Contributions of the research will provide new knowledge on wind effects at the building level which can help to enhance community resilience and national welfare. These contributions are important for the natural hazards engineering community to develop improved designs for new buildings and innovative retrofitting approaches for existing buildings, thus benefiting society through future damage reduction during windstorms. This award will contribute to the NSF's statutory role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research project is to utilize ML methods informed by large-scale model wind tunnel testing to: (1) provide a quantitative, robust, and cost-effective ML methodology that will enable a deeper understanding of building aerodynamics; and (2) address a major challenge regarding scaling effects on bluff body aerodynamics by predicting wind loads on full-scale real buildings based on data obtained for scaled wind tunnel models via an advanced data-driven technique, known as few-shot learning. The scientific objective of this project is to create, verify, and validate a data-driven framework to accurately predict wind loads on low-rise structures and associated uncertainties, while considering inflow turbulence, geometry, and scaling errors due to Reynolds number violation. This data-driven framework seeks to enable professionals to predict full-scale pressures more reliably on buildings, leading to improved design. The central hypothesis is that with a data-driven ML approach, low-rise building aerodynamics and the associated sensitivity to critical parameters can be better understood, while the need for expensive physical testing or numerical simulations can be substantially reduced. The outcomes of this study will provide an extensive data repository for wind effects on low-rise structures. Wind tunnel testing will be conducted at the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind at Florida International University. Project data will be archived in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Direct and precise control of large population of individuals has emerged as a new frontier across engineering disciplines. However, existing solutions fall short in practice as they fail to account for realistic nonlinear agent models, inter-agent interactions, statistical errors, and constraints affecting the uncertain dynamics of the population. This project will address this critical gap by designing theory and computational algorithms with performance guarantees. The research transcends the discipline of control engineering and will be impactful in machine learning where there remains a critical need for precise control of data distributions. The project will train the next generation of students and engineers working in the broad areas of control, machine learning and their intersection, via several educational and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project explores a new vision advancing the theory and algorithms for the control of distributions. The distributions may correspond to the stochastic states of a single controlled dynamical system giving rise to time-varying state probability distributions. Alternatively, the distributions may correspond to population ensembles wherein the dynamics of an individual agent in the population can be nonlinear in state, non-affine in control, and the agents may interact in a nonlocal manner. The project focuses on three main challenges that remain in this area involving nonlinearity in dynamics, interactions among agents and robustness of control policy. The project will deliver a suite of theory and algorithms for the control of distributions in either case, with optimality and robustness guarantees in the presence of hard deadline and controlled dynamical constraints, with or without process noise. The outcomes will enable scalable nonparametric gridless computation beyond second order statistics (i.e., covariance control), thereby unlocking the full potential of distribution control in practical applications. The broader impact of this project will result from fundamental advances in theory and computational methods to benefit the fields of stochastic optimal control, optimal mass transport, Schrödinger bridge -- all three are finding rapid adoption in generative diffusion models in machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It explores its physical realization through an intelligent wearable exercise ""reminder"" system called ""Souvenir"" and an adaptive machine intelligence that optimizes personalized interventions. The system looks to deliver physical and textual smartphone ""nudges"" to motivate therapeutic exercise after a stroke. This work looks to address a significant problem: many stroke survivors habitually refrain from using their hemiparetic limbs despite retaining sufficient ability to move them, a phenomenon known as ""learned non-use"". Learned non-use limits a person's ability to perform activities essential for independent living. The project will conduct fundamental research needed to develop an explainable machine intelligence capable of assessing patient motivation in real time, adapting the challenge level of therapeutic activities based on those assessments and the patient's current ability, and cueing activities in an unobtrusive manner. By leveraging the behavioral science of motivation to increase compliance with prescribed exercise, the project looks to advance the mission of the National Science Foundation by promoting scientific progress and enhancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project also includes public outreach and educational activities designed to promote science literacy among students and the general public.<br/><br/>The current state-of-the-art treatment for addressing learned non-use after stroke is a two-week intensive intervention known as constraint-induced movement therapy, designed to engage a virtuous cycle of functional recovery. While this approach can lead to clinically meaningful improvements in paretic arm function that may persist for up to two years, most clinicians do not adopt it due to its high demands on time and lack of specialized training. A low-cost, low-burden alternative is urgently needed, one that both clinicians and patients will actually use. This project looks to advance the goals of the M3X program by conducting fundamental research in embodied reasoning (patient modeling and state estimation) as mediated by bidirectional sensorimotor interactions. This involves motion monitoring and the exchange of physical and textual cues between a human patient and a synthetic actor (Souvenir). The project will follow a user-centric design approach, iterating through computational modeling, software engineering, user focus groups, pilot testing, and assessment to develop and refine an explainable machine intelligence. This system seeks to assess patient motivation in real time and adapt the challenge level of therapeutic activities based on those assessments and the patient's current ability. The project concludes with a feasibility demonstration through human subject experiments, testing how an intelligent machine can influence individual human behaviors to optimize sensorimotor performance and recovery after stroke.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current formulation of the Standard Model does not account for the observed value of the Higgs boson mass, making discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model a primary goal of the LHC experiments, including those being carried out in this award involving the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS). <br/><br/>This work will focus on searches for new physics, as well as upgrade developments toward the High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) for the CMS experiment during the High-Luminosity LHC run in the early 2030s.

The primary analysis goal is to search for vector-like quark (VLQ) pair production with the record-breaking CMS dataset. Several deep machine learning algorithms will be developed to identify hadronic decays of bottom quarks, top quarks, W, Z, and Higgs bosons, which are all reconstructed as jets with unique internal structure. With these deep learning techniques, VLQ pair production searches can be dramatically improved to include identification and mass reconstruction. Specifically, this work will use image recognition machine learning techniques to develop jet identification algorithms for HL-LHC studies. Additionally, extensive development will be made on design features and assembly procedures for upgraded silicon sensors to be used in the HGCAL. The Bethel CMS group will participate in module production tests at Fermilab. This award will allow the Bethel group to engage with several outreach and education activities, reaching high school students and the general public through tours of detector exhibits and preparing new students and collaborators for CMS analysis via an annual Data Analysis School and hands-on summer tutorials.

In natural systems, such as those found in animals, the brain and body must collaborate effectively for the successful navigation of a complex environment. The brain contributes computational intelligence, while the body provides mechanical intelligence. Integrating these elements?computational and mechanical intelligence?into the concept of mechano-computation represents a frontier in both robotics and neuroscience research. Progress in this field necessitates interdisciplinary communication and collaboration across various scientific domains. To propel this promising field forward, the Mechano-computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH) Network aims to unite diverse researchers from robotics, mechanics, materials science, neuroscience, information theory, biology, engineering design, and applied mathematics. Through workshops, travel grants, and the facilitation of collaborative projects, this network seeks to stimulate interdisciplinary dialogue, develop rigorous metrics for assessing autonomous systems, train the next generation of researchers, and push the boundaries of research in all areas of mechano-computation. By establishing a centralized resource for sharing findings, benchmarks, and methodologies, this network of researchers can accelerate innovation and position the United States as a leader in this transformative field, laying the groundwork for enhanced robotic systems in healthcare, agriculture, forestry, national security, and beyond. It may be argued that the full potential of robotics will not be realized until an intelligent physical body is purposefully designed from the outset, with careful consideration of both the available computational intelligence and the affordances the body can provide?affordances that, if appropriately leveraged, can offload and simplify computational demands by enabling efficient, embodied solutions to complex tasks.<br/><br/>The Mechano-computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH) Network will bring together leading experts to tackle these critical challenges in autonomous systems through the integration of mechanical and computational intelligence.

Because it is so small, it is not possible to take an ordinary photograph to investigate its basic properties, shape, and structure. Other methods must be employed to ?develop a picture? of the nucleus. While we often think of nuclei as spherical in shape, more often they are deformed spheres like an onion or a football. To investigate these structures, the team at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory uses a Van de Graaff accelerator and a nuclear reaction to produce neutrons, which they scatter from nuclei of interest. The neutron scattering process produces gamma rays that can be used to construct an image of the nucleus. These images contribute to understanding how protons and neutrons interact within the nucleus to form matter in the universe. In addition, students at all levels are provided with opportunities to participate in these studies. Program participants receive hands-on experience and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to national energy, medical, and security needs.<br/><br/>The University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory (UKAL) specializes in producing nearly monoenergetic neutrons. Employing this probe for inelastic neutron scattering studies (INS) yields a wealth of information for nuclear structure including the population of excited states which are often inaccessible with other methods, and the measurement of level lifetimes via the Doppler-shift attenuation method. The primary goal of this work is to provide detailed spectroscopic data that lead to the understanding of the fundamental properties of atomic nuclei. The team at UKAL will continue to investigate open questions about shape coexistence and the onset of collectivity in nuclei within selected isotopic chains as well as study isotopes of interest for neutrinoless double-beta decay, 0???. The researchers will also perform complementary measurements in collaboration at other facilities and work together with theorists to provide interpretations of the data obtained. Perhaps the largest advantage of university nuclear laboratories is the ability of learners at all levels to gain hands-on experience with all aspects of the experimental process.

A protein's shape determines how it interacts within the body, and this knowledge is critical for drug development. Recent breakthroughs in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have allowed scientists to capture detailed images of proteins in their natural state. These images capture the structure of the sample and facilitate the study of the structures in their natural state. In practice though, many of the obtained protein images are of medium resolution and pose challenges to the study of protein?s secondary structure. To address this weakness in existing microscopy, this research aims to develop a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational framework that leverages advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of modeling protein structures from medium-resolution images. This novel method will combine static quality information with adaptive learning strategies so that the new model will enhance its ability to fully capture structural features of proteins even when the data are from medium-quality images. <br/><br/><br/>Structural inconsistencies in protein secondary structures in cryo-EM images pose challenges for their accurate determination. The project will first focus on characterizing these inconsistencies and variability. It will then integrate this understanding into the design of effective strategies to address variations in structural quality and shape geometry with a machine learning-based semantic segmentation model.  The research will employ curriculum learning strategies where models are trained with increasing levels of difficulty for semi-optimal situations when global optimum is difficult to obtain. The method integrates dynamic curriculum learning strategies into advanced semantic segmentation-based deep learning architectures to enhance the modeling of secondary structures. By combining static quality information with adaptive learning strategies, the model will enhance its ability to capture structural features of varying complexity and geometry.<br/>This research will enable improved modeling of protein secondary structures by addressing structural inconsistencies observed in medium-resolution cryo-EM data.

Breaking them down efficiently and selectively is a key first step in biotechnology, as over 70% of their content consists of sugars that can be converted into bioethanol through chemical or enzymatic treatment and fermentation. However, these materials are naturally resistant to breakdown, making biofuel production challenging. To access the sugars, chemical pretreatments are used to separate the main components, but these processes consume large amounts of water, chemicals, and solvents, often damaging plant structures and producing harmful waste that threatens water quality. This project will explore dry fractionation as a sustainable and environmentally responsible alternative to conventional separation methods. Dry fractionation eliminates the need for chemicals and water, and generates no waste, while preserving structural integrity of key biopolymers. Results from the project could enable U.S. biorefineries to make special plant-based fibers at a significantly reduced cost compared with current methods. The project will help undergraduate and graduate students gain real-world experience in research, communication, and mentorship and receive industry feedback to make learning more relevant to modern bioprocessing needs. Additionally, the project will promote public engagement and STEM education through outreach activities like educational videos and a lignin nanofiber resource for students. By building stronger ties between universities and the biorefinery industry, the research will support innovation and collaboration that can drive sustainable technology development.<br/><br/>This project will create a dry and chemical-free tribo-electrostatic separation (TES) method to separate agricultural biomass residues into two distinct fractions: a cellulose-rich fraction suitable for biofuel feedstock and a lignin-rich fraction to be further transformed into nanofiber biomaterials through electrospinning. These lignin-based nanofibers will potentially serve as effective adsorbents for organic contaminants and as components in supercapacitors. The overarching hypothesis is that cellulose's distinct surface properties and compositions compared to lignin and hemicellulose will result in different triboelectric charging behaviors, enabling their subsequent TES separation under an electric field. This research will 1) Investigate the relationship between triboelectric charging behaviors of biomass particles with their composition and physical properties; 2) Explore the TES separation behavior of biomass residues milled at varying particle sizes; 3) Assess the spinnability of electrostatically enriched lignin fractions for nanofiber production. Successful completion of this project will fill essential data gaps by investigating the tribo-charging behavior of biomass residues, enabling the development of completely dry, waste- and chemical-free TES while providing insight into critical factors affecting the purity of lignin-enriched fractions for nanofibers by electrospinning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development and implementation of novel experimental methods and techniques have renewed interest in physical problems which present significant conceptual and technical challenges. These include effects associated with the response of superconducting materials to light and other applied electromagnetic radiation beyond standard textbook approaches. Another example is presented by the unusual way charge can move through novel quantum devices and heterostructures when a strong magnetic or electric field is applied. This is encoded in the transport properties of the material or system. The PI will focus on establishing basic physical principles which would enable robust control over how these materials and devices transfer electric charge and energy in response to externally applied fields. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to enable the study of transport and optical properties of novel materials beyond the limitations of textbook approaches. Importantly, a major part of the project focuses on discovering novel nonlinear physical effects and formulating specific theoretical predictions which can be verified experimentally. <br/><br/>The successful completion of the project will have a broader impact on scientific and non-scientific communities. Currently the PI aims to reach audiences beyond the Kent State campus by transforming the most popular topics from the freshman course Physics, the Human Adventure into public lectures for middle and high school students.

Specifically, the main research objectives of this project are:<br/><br/>?	to advance a theoretical description of nonlinear electromagnetic responses of disordered superconductors for both weak and strong coupling. The PI aims to develop a theory to describe the collisionless dynamics induced by an external electromagnetic field applied to superconductors in the presence of pair breaking processes. The PI plans to consider superconductors for both weak and strong coupling. <br/>?	to develop a detailed theory of the planar Hall effect. The main outcome of this project will be a set of theoretical predictions which can be tested using transition metal dichalcogenides, the surface states of the topological insulators and two-dimensional electronic gas at lanthanum titanate / strontium titanate interfaces as possible experimental platforms. <br/>?	to develop a theory of ac-conductivity, Hall effect, and nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation rate in fluctuating superconductors near a pair breaking quantum phase transition. This project builds on recent work, where the effects of quantum fluctuations on dc-conductivity have been considered in a model of a two-band fluctuating superconductor near a superconducting quantum critical point. The work is motivated by recent experimental results on iron-based superconductors. <br/><br/>All three research objectives have a common overarching theme of nonlinear phenomena and are experimentally motivated; the first two projects are focused on response functions in the nonlinear regime, while the third project addresses intrinsically nonlinear effects at the level of a linear response theory. <br/><br/>An active learning approach will be the touchstone of the educational component of the project. The PI will continue his collaboration with colleagues from the Department of Psychology which aims to evaluate the impact of an easy-to-use learning program on students? learning and comprehension of STEM content.

Highly deformable thin shells can be elastically stowed and self-deployed while exhibiting superior stiffness to mass ratios when compared to other shape changing mechanisms. However, excessively tight packaging causes prolonged and disordered motion during deployment. This is driven by propagating instabilities consisting of the buckled formation and travel of localized folds. The underlying factors that cause multiple fold propagations, including interaction behaviors between folds, remain fundamentally unexplained. If left unregulated, the resulting motion could cause incomplete deployment and damage due to collision or entanglement. This award will support research focused on elucidating the mechanics of propagating instabilities that inform the robust design and packaging of deployable shell structures. The outcomes are anticipated to include new design principles for future deployable and adaptive structures that will advance the frontiers of space exploration, robotics, and morphing vehicles. Furthermore, this award will spark early interest in STEM and motivate students to pursue STEM careers through lab internships for high school students, research opportunities for undergraduate students, and exhibitions at local STEM events and museums.<br/><br/>The main objective of this research award is to characterize the structural, dynamic, and packaging parameters that govern multiple fold propagation behaviors in deployable shell structures. A computational framework will produce response maps that visualize the motion and interaction of these deformations while strain energy stability landscapes will explain the underlying mechanisms. Novel fold interaction behaviors will be fundamentally understood including convergence, merging, reflections, divergence, and bifurcation. Experimental validation of the deployment paths will be provided by discrete, full-field, and embedded measurement techniques. The second objective is to investigate packaging and design methods that modulate multiple propagating instabilities in composite shells by (1) increasing the stability level of packaged folds that interact with and dissipate the energetic propagation of highly unstable folds, and (2) altering the local shape and layup in the traveling path of folds to manipulate their movement. The generated knowledge will be of the fold arrangements and localized changes to the shell that effectively suppress excessive deployment motion. This will be extended to more complex shell profiles and 3D shell formations, which will help explain how propagating instabilities behave and are modulated in kinematically coupled and variable curvature shell structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In natural systems, such as those found in animals, the brain and body must collaborate effectively for the successful navigation of a complex environment. The brain contributes computational intelligence, while the body provides mechanical intelligence. Integrating these elements?computational and mechanical intelligence?into the concept of mechano-computation represents a frontier in both robotics and neuroscience research. Progress in this field necessitates interdisciplinary communication and collaboration across various scientific domains. To propel this promising field forward, the Mechano-computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH) Network aims to unite diverse researchers from robotics, mechanics, materials science, neuroscience, information theory, biology, engineering design, and applied mathematics. Through workshops, travel grants, and the facilitation of collaborative projects, this network seeks to stimulate interdisciplinary dialogue, develop rigorous metrics for assessing autonomous systems, train the next generation of researchers, and push the boundaries of research in all areas of mechano-computation. By establishing a centralized resource for sharing findings, benchmarks, and methodologies, this network of researchers can accelerate innovation and position the United States as a leader in this transformative field, laying the groundwork for enhanced robotic systems in healthcare, agriculture, forestry, national security, and beyond. It may be argued that the full potential of robotics will not be realized until an intelligent physical body is purposefully designed from the outset, with careful consideration of both the available computational intelligence and the affordances the body can provide?affordances that, if appropriately leveraged, can offload and simplify computational demands by enabling efficient, embodied solutions to complex tasks.<br/><br/>The Mechano-computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH) Network will bring together leading experts to tackle these critical challenges in autonomous systems through the integration of mechanical and computational intelligence. Creating intentional mechano-computation will enhance the design and control of autonomous systems, making them more efficient and explainable, and it will contribute to the development of innovative materials, mechanisms, and control strategies, pushing the boundaries of current research. We anticipate five key outcomes as a result of the formation of the MESH Network: (1) A comprehensive theoretical framework and standardized metrics for mechano-computation; (2) Improved interdisciplinary collaboration and communication among researchers; (3) Long-term interactions among network members and early-career researchers, including nurturing graduate students trained at the intersection of disciplines; (4) Sharing of innovative materials, mechanisms, and control strategies; (5) Practical demonstrations by network participants of mechano-computation systems addressing societal and environmental challenges.

However, intensive farming practices can contribute to significant environmental impacts, such as groundwater depletion, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity. At the same time, these farming systems are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as droughts and heavy rainfall, driven by a changing climate. To ensure long-term sustainability, it is essential to balance crop productivity with environmental stewardship. This work focuses on understanding how farming practices impact both the environment and crop resilience under these challenges. Working closely with farmers, the project will develop an easy-to-use tool to help them make informed decisions that optimize productivity while minimizing environmental harm. Additionally, the project will foster education and mentorship through the creation of a mentorship network and connecting agricultural communities with the knowledge and resources needed to achieve more resilient and sustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this work is to advance sustainable agricultural practices through research, education, and mentorship by integrating and advancing water footprint and environmental impact assessment tools. A critical challenge in agriculture is the lack of systems-level understanding of how farm management decisions impact the environment under variable and changing climate conditions. This proposal addresses this gap through three specific objectives: (1) quantify and assess environmental impacts of farm management decisions under variable climate conditions, (2) develop and implement a site-specific, user-friendly decision-making tool, and (3) establish and sustain a state-wide mentorship network to recruit and retain students. The underlying research hypothesis is that environmental impacts of agriculture will shift in response to climate transitions due to evolving management decisions, requiring site- and scenario-specific recommendations to minimize negative outcomes. To address this, the research integrates field measurements from an experimental irrigated cropping system under diverse management scenarios, process-based model calibration and validation, life cycle assessment, water footprint analysis, and projections under future climate scenarios. These efforts will culminate in the development of an online decision-support tool to help farmers make informed, sustainable decisions tailored to their specific conditions. The educational aim is to establish tools and networks for long-term learning and mentorship, with a particular focus on supporting neurodivergent students during educational transitions. This includes the creation of a multi-tiered mentorship program to promote broad engagement in environmental and agricultural fields. Together, the research, education, and mentorship efforts will enhance understanding of the interplay between agricultural management, climate variability, and environmental impacts, while fostering a robust, informed, and inclusive workforce dedicated to sustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The various systems targeted for study require the detailed quantum mechanical description of several simultaneously interacting particles, be they atoms, molecules, or atomic nucleons.  This class of quantum mechanical problems constitutes the field of few-body physics, and as the number of particles increases, the difficulty of solving the quantum mechanical equations grows exponentially: Few previous studies have successfully ventured beyond the celebrated 3-body problem.  In this project, novel and unconventional techniques are developed and extended, including the adoption of atypical coordinate systems and novel representations of the quantum states, thereby enabling results for 3-body, 4-body and even 5-body problems.  The goals of the project include concrete and detailed predictions of the behavior, energy level structure, and reaction rates amenable to experimental verification, including some which would support ongoing efforts to advance quantum information science.  The project is expected to yield credible predictions of new phenomena and to stimulate qualitative insights that might suggest new paths for furthering the advance of this field of research.  The effort will also strengthen the pool of talent capable of tackling the most challenging theoretical questions in the microscopic world.<br/><br/>The specific topics being studied involve few-body systems at nanokelvin temperatures that are of current interest in the realm of ultracold atomic and molecular physics.  One area is the development of the quantum theory of three-body recombination in an ultracold gas of microwave-shielded polar molecules, which is a key loss process in that system which remains poorly understood.  An adiabatic representation in hyperspherical coordinates will be implemented to describe this process and explore novel bound states known as Efimov states.  Another area of concentration for the project is the delicate binding of Rydberg molecules to a ground state atom at enormous length scales, separated by hundreds or even thousands of Bohr radii.

Rock slope failures pose significant risks to lives, infrastructure, and economies. These slopes are made of structured rock masses, which include intact rock blocks (rock matrix) intersected by natural fractures. Predicting the stability of such slopes is difficult due to the complex interactions between the rock matrix and natural fractures. Traditional models often oversimplify these interactions, averaging properties of the rock mass, failing to account for the distinct roles of the rock matrix and natural fractures in instability, and thus overestimating the safety margins and leading to inadequate risk assessments. This project seeks to advance fundamental knowledge of how the properties and degradation rates of the jointed rock components ? i.e., natural fractures and the rock matrix ? influence the instability of jointed rock slopes to improve predictive models and contribute to the safety and sustainability of infrastructure in mountainous regions. Other broader impacts include engaging students of different ages and the general public in innovative STEM outreach activities, such as inquiry-based problem-solving techniques for high school students, the Youth-in-Custody program participants, and visitors of natural history museums and mountainous national parks, to inspire public appreciation for civil and geotechnical engineering. Graduate and undergraduate students look to develop science communication skills through the design and delivery of educational and outreach activities. Each activity will be evaluated for its effectiveness in increasing enrollment in the regional civil engineering schools and the effects of inquiry-based activities on the public?s perception of engineering. The project is expected to expand participation in STEM fields and foster partnerships between universities, national parks, and local communities.<br/><br/>The research looks to integrate laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to reveal the mechanisms driving fracture evolution and progressive failure processes in jointed rock slopes. The results seek to quantify the consequences of jointed rock failure, such as failing rock volume, runout distance, and velocity. The distinct contributions of the rock matrix and natural fractures to slope stability and the factor of safety look to be characterized based on the contrast between the hydraulic and mechanical properties of these components and the geometric characteristics of the slope relative to the natural fracture network. Experimental studies seek to simulate fracture-matrix interactions at various scales by monitoring the evolution of strain and fractures on the surface and through rock blocks and joints using high-spatiotemporal process monitoring techniques, such as digital image correlation and acoustic emission measurements. Scaled jointed rock slopes will be constructed in the laboratory using metal-ceramic 3D-printed rock blocks, with elevated gravity achieved by applying a strong magnetic field. Hydromechanically coupled, hybrid continuum-discontinuous numerical models will be calibrated and validated with experimental results with the intent of extending scenarios of the effects of contrasting hydromechanical properties and strength degradation rates on the instability of jointed rock slopes. These models seek to provide insights into strain and water pressure distribution effects on failure progression in full-scale jointed rock slopes. This project is expected to advance the state of the art in rock mechanics and slope stability analysis, improve infrastructure safety, and foster an informed STEM workforce through cutting-edge research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to develop tools that improve decision quality, support valid statistical inference, and enhance interpretability in RL algorithms, ultimately building trust and accountability for real-world applications. The broader impacts include advancing the science of machine learning, improving decision-making in resource-constrained settings, and training future data scientists through interdisciplinary mentorship and open educational resources.<br/><br/>The research focuses on developing theoretical foundations and methods for reliable inference and decision-making in RL when data is scarce and models are misspecified.

This project will develop new technologies that enable STIL models to selectively forget specific user data without retraining from scratch. The novelty of this project lies in its ability to effectively erase individual trajectories or behaviors embedded in complex user data, while preserving the utility and accuracy of the original models. The proposed technologies will empower users with control over their data and help ensure that AI systems used in urban intelligence are not only effective but also privacy and legally compliant. <br/><br/>This project will pioneer a new research direction in machine unlearning within the spatial-temporal imitation learning (STIL) domain by introducing the SIFT (Spatial-temporal Imitation ForgeTting) framework.

The research will develop innovative methods including negation trajectory generation and reward shaping to remove privacy-sensitive data, spatial-temporal partitioning and similarity-based data augmentation to handle data sparsity and variability, and differential privacy techniques to ensure provable unlearning guarantees.

In many cases, these structures are universal, meaning they arise independently of conditions such as initial data and, in some cases, even of the governing equations. The project will develop and apply mathematical tools to identify and characterize emergent asymptotic phenomena in nonlinear wave models, with a particular focus on non-generic or anomalous behavior.

Water distributors and building owners try to kill biofilm bacteria with disinfectants and high temperatures, but biofilms are resilient. The goal of this career project is to engineer a biofilm that promotes good bacteria that can outcompete unwanted ones. If successful, this strategy to work with biofilms, instead of against them, will lead to more stable drinking water quality. It will also be more sustainable, with lower energy and material costs. Understanding more about biofilms in our water pipes will improve guidance that makes drinking water safe. Educational and outreach activities will strengthen the Nation?s STEM workforce and empower the public to take control of their own drinking water quality.  <br/><br/>Most microbes in drinking water systems reside in biofilms along pipe walls. While these microbes are largely benign, drinking water pathogens associated with the immunocompromised, or opportunistic pathogens, thrive in biofilms. Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are estimated to cost more than $2.4 billion in healthcare costs each year. Current strategies to control these pathogens in plumbing systems, if effective, are unsustainable, with high energy, maintenance, and material costs. Even with disinfectant, biofilm formation in plumbing is largely inevitable. New strategies are required to control these biofilms and reduce exposure to pathogens from drinking water. An approach embracing biology can be more sustainable and provide greater stability in plumbing systems. This project will engineer drinking water biofilms to have long-term biological stability and resistance to invasion, especially by pathogens. The scalable approach will establish a competitive model microbial consortium specific to drinking water. At the bench-scale, coupon experiments and a cell printing method will be used to control initial biofilm colonization.

Finally, the same facility and pure culture experiments will be used to explore and validate models of biofilm-water interactions. This approach considers the unique reality of plumbing, with high surface area to volume ratios and intermittent flow.

However, in practice, applications have a fixed number of particles and the mean field approximation may become inaccurate over long time scales since the exact solution may deviate from the mean-field limit exponentially fast. The investigator studies the deviations to the mean-field limit to derive more accurate descriptions, and better capture the long-time behavior.

This project seeks to address this critical gap by designing theory and computational algorithms with performance guarantees. The research could transcend the discipline of control engineering and will be impactful in machine learning where there remains a critical need for precise control of data distributions. The project looks to train the next generation of students and engineers working in the broad areas of control, machine learning and their intersection, via several educational and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project explores a new vision advancing the theory and algorithms for the control of distributions.

Alternatively, the distributions may correspond to population ensembles wherein the dynamics of an individual agent in the population can be nonlinear in state, non-affine in control, and the agents may interact in a nonlocal manner. The project focuses on three main challenges that remain in this area involving nonlinearity in dynamics, interactions among agents, and robustness of control policy. The project looks to deliver a suite of theory and algorithms for the control of distributions in either case, with optimality and robustness guarantees in the presence of hard deadline and controlled dynamical constraints, with or without process noise. The outcomes seek to enable scalable nonparametric gridless computation beyond second order statistics (i.e., covariance control), thereby unlocking the full potential of distribution control in practical applications.

Important outcomes may occur during a particular season, such as pests eating crops, but those outcomes are driven by recurring effects between seasons. For example, pests eating during summer affects their hibernation during winter, and survival during winter affects reproduction for the next summer. Accurately quantifying this type of effect is important for understanding long-term outcomes in seasonal ecosystems. This work studies a mathematical description of recurring change, which combines two well-established frameworks into a more complex approach. In particular, this work is concerned with how well the approach can match real-world data. An important factor is whether information obtained from data is accurate and how this affects confidence in mathematical results. The work begins with a simulated test of these problems, before incorporating real data from two studies. The studies concern mosquitoes and bees, highlighting the broad potential applications of this approach. Mosquitoes are common disease vectors that impact human health, and bees provide pollination that impacts agriculture and food security. The project also includes an education component that aims to improve quantitative preparation of biology students alongside interdisciplinary preparation of mathematics students.<br/><br/>In this work, feedback between seasonal behaviors is described by hybrid-timescale models. These models couple continuous differential equations (for fast, short-term interactions) with discrete difference equations (for slow, seasonal behaviors). Use of these models may be complicated by intractable analysis and high sensitivity to model inputs. Moreover, their application-level utility depends on the ability to accurately represent true ecosystems. This work will assess parameter estimation and identifiability for these models (or, whether model parameters can be uniquely and reliably recovered from data). Preliminary work will establish appropriate methods and criteria to assess identifiability, using simple models fit to synthetic data. The resulting methods will be applied to empirical data in two applications, under increasingly complex conditions. Taken together, these assessments will establish conditions under which hybrid-timescale models can be practically implemented in seasonal ecosystems.

One separation method is to adsorb molecules of the desired species onto the surface of an adsorbent. Later, the same molecules can be desorbed and recovered. The efficiency of the separation could be improved by modifying the adsorbent for each desired separation.  Promising adsorbents can be identified by screening vast ?libraries? of possible candidates using a computer. However there is a major hurdle: the attractive forces between the desired molecule and each candidate adsorbent in the library are unknown. This project will develop machine learning tools to rapidly predict the forces. These predictions will be used to identify optimal adsorbents for some industrially important separation processes. The results of this project will improve the efficiency of adsorptive separation processes. Additional benefits will come from outreach to high school students through summer research programs, to professionals via online courses, and to broad audiences through an educational video.<br/><br/>Chemisorption is the adsorption of a molecule on a surface accompanied by the formation of chemical bonds. Chemisorption is relevant to many separation processes that are based on adsorption/desorption using an adsorbent surface. A major ongoing research effort is the computational design of adsorbents that can selectively adsorb desirable species out of a mixture. A crucial step in such computations is to develop interaction potentials to describe the chemisorption between the molecule and the surface. This project seeks to reduce the computational effort to develop such interaction potentials. Simulations will be conducted to obtain interaction potentials between specific molecules and adsorbent surfaces. These data will be fed to a machine learning model to predict the interaction potential between the same molecules and other adsorbent surfaces. The central hypothesis to be tested is that adsorbent surfaces can be treated as ?building blocks? so that the interaction potentials are transferrable from one adsorbent to another with similar building blocks. This project will dramatically boost data generation capabilities to train artificial intelligence frameworks for adsorbent discovery. The project will rapidly screen hundreds of thousands of metal organic frameworks to identify adsorbents that can separate mixtures of small molecules such as ethane/ethylene, ammonia/nitrogen/hydrogen, etc. Separation of such mixtures is immensely important in the chemical industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Helmholtz problems are notoriously difficult to solve computationally, and there has been much research into finding better algorithms for this key and essential task. Despite this past research, there remains room for improvement. The benefit of improved algorithms could be, for example, the creation of advanced optical meta-materials that can outperform traditional optical devices used in civilian and military applications, e.g., being lighter, using less power, or operating in multiple regimes. This proposal will develop new fast algorithms for solving Helmholtz problems. The algorithms are optimal in the sense that the number of operations needed to solve the problem is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom (number of unknowns). The breakthrough is based on viewing the Helmholtz problem as the time-periodic solution of an associated wave propagation problem using the recently developed WaveHoltz algorithm.<br/><br/>Time-periodic problems and associated eigenvalue problems arise in a wide range of applications in engineering and applied sciences involving systems exhibiting time-harmonic behavior. This proposal aims to address problems of this type by developing new and efficient high-order accurate algorithms for solving large-scale Helmholtz and eigenvalue problems for multi-domain and multi-physics applications. Numerical schemes for these problems will be based on an extended WaveHoltz algorithm for Helmholtz problems, along with a new EigenWave algorithm for eigenvalue problems.  WaveHoltz computes solutions to the Helmholtz problem by filtering solutions of a related time-domain wave equation, thus avoiding the need to invert a large, indefinite matrix. The EigenWave algorithm follows a similar approach and can compute eigenvalues of an elliptic operator anywhere in the spectrum without inverting an indefinite shifted matrix. In addition to the extension of WaveHoltz to complex geometry on overset grids, the basic WaveHoltz approach will be accelerated using large-time-step implicit time-stepping at an O(N) cost per iteration (N being the number of grid points), and by deflation using eigenmodes (or approximate coarse-grid eigenmodes) computed with the new EigenWave algorithm. Dispersive (pollution) errors will be ameliorated using high-order accurate spatial approximations. WaveHoltz will also be extended to dispersive wave propagation problems as well as multi-domain problems that couple different physics or materials in different domains, coupled with high-order accurate interface conditions. For open domain problems (e.g. scattering problems) the new algorithms will be coupled to advanced radiation boundary conditions.  The development of the proposed algorithms and simulation capabilities will lead to a new and transformative approach for solving large-scale Helmholtz and eigenvalue problems, and will provide high-performance open source software tools to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Is there a way to quantify the constructive and destructive interference produced as waves traveling in different directions interact? One way to answer this question is using Fourier decoupling, a mathematical theory that has recently led to spectacular advances on various longstanding conjectures across diverse areas of mathematics. The PI aims to broaden the scope of Fourier decoupling by extending it to new settings such as alternative ways of measuring cancellation and more general geometric surfaces currently not covered by the known theory. Another goal is to build a unifying framework between Fourier decoupling and the seemingly unrelated mathematical theory of efficient congruencing which will bring new ideas to the areas of Fourier analysis and number theory. Furthermore, the PI plans to apply techniques from Fourier decoupling to the analysis of Boolean functions in computer science, with the goal of deepening our theoretical understanding of areas such as algorithmic learning theory. Finally, the project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in research, the organization of international summer schools, and develop an early-career analysis community across the US advancing both scientific discovery and educational development.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, the project focuses on advancing Fourier decoupling theory and its applications across harmonic analysis, number theory, and theoretical computer science. Key goals include: (1) interpreting the 2012 Parsell-Prendiville-Wooley argument on translation-dilation invariant systems in decoupling language; (2) developing new mixed norm decoupling inequalities relevant to dispersive partial differential equations and extending known Strichartz estimates; (3) adapting the high-low method to the moment curve setting to derive logarithmic power bounds for decoupling constants, giving potential number theoretic applications; (4) proving new refined decoupling estimates and applying them to problems like the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture; and (5) exploring connections between Euclidean harmonic analysis and Boolean function analysis, especially the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality and the Friedgut-Kalai-Naor Theorem, with implications for learning theory. Expected contributions include sharper bounds in decoupling theory, new decoupling theorems for highly general surfaces, improved maximal function bounds for the Schrödinger equation on the torus, and new analytic tools for use in algorithmic contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, geometry has entered the scene and has provided new perspectives for tackling long-standing problems in matroid theory. Behind the resolution of each of these conjectures is an algebraic invariant that exists for any matroid, but whose properties are predicted by geometry. The broad aim of this project is to study these algebraic invariants with a focus on uncovering their impact and applications throughout combinatorics.  This project includes mentoring graduate students, creating a learning community at NC State for graduate students interested in combinatorics, and initiating a middle-school outreach activity in Raleigh, NC.<br/><br/>The first project aims to give a simpler and more general definition of the intersection cohomology module of a matroid, a module that played a key role in the proof of Dowling?Wilson's top heavy conjecture from 1975.  This new definition will work over positive characteristic fields and thus will lead to positive characteristic analogues of Kazhdan?Lusztig polynomials of matroids.  The project will also introduce a matroidal analogue of Stanley's local h-polynomials with the aim of shedding light on classical problems in graph colorability and matroid realizability. The second project aims to understand to what extent there might be a ""Chow theory"" for arbitrary partially ordered sets.  In the settings of matroids, polytopes, and Coxeter groups, the Chow polynomials of posets have interpretations in terms of well-studied notions in the three respective areas.  The guiding theme is to prove results for arbitrary graded bounded posets by discovering commonalities among these three settings; and, on the other hand, to interpret results that hold for arbitrary posets in these three specific settings. The third project aims to understand log-concavity phenomena in algebraic combinatorics and commutative algebra.  On the one hand, new techniques from commutative algebra will be introduced into the study of log-concavity of polynomials with the goal of investigating log-concavity conjectures for Schur-like polynomials; and, on the other hand, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials will be used to investigate log-concavity questions for natural polynomials arising in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Capitalizing on these new technologies, this project focuses on critical statistical challenges that must be overcome to tackle a central challenge of neuroscience: linking brain activity to behavioral output. Neural and behavioral data are noisy, high-dimensional time series with complex dynamics. This project will develop novel computational and statistical methods to analyze these data and offer new insight into how the brain produces natural behavior.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will develop state space models (SSMs) ? statistical models for high-dimensional time series data ? to link brain activity and behavior. The first objective is to develop SSMs for neural recordings. These methods will allow scientists to model how brain activity changes across contexts, how it is influenced by chemical signals like neuromodulators and neuropeptides, and how it can be precisely modulated through real-time, closed-loop experiments. The second objective is to develop similar methods for the study of behavioral video data, allowing scientists to quantitatively capture how behavior is shaped by modulatory inputs, how it changes throughout aging, and how behavior is structured in pursuit of latent goals. Finally, this project will leverage state-of-the-art methods in artificial intelligence called deep SSMs, tailoring them for use in brain-computer interfaces, and developing a theory of how deep SSMs work. Altogether, this project will contribute novel methods that will provide new insight into how the brain produces rich, natural behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of these are robots that can run or autonomous cars that can navigate cluttered streets. To make these algorithms work, people use simulation. The problem is that in practice, these robots struggle to solve similar challenges in the real-world, due to the lack of controllability in these applications. The more realistic the environment, the more data that are required, and the more time that is needed for such robots to work effectively. These challenges are made even more difficult by what is known as the sim(ulatio)n-to-real gap, which refers to the problem of applying what has been learned in computer simulations to real-life situations where conditions are different and less predictable. These limitations restrict the use of the algorithms and robots in important areas where collecting data is expensive, risky, or impractical, such as healthcare robotics or emergency response systems. This project will address these key limitations by eliminating reliance on simulators altogether and developing reinforcement learning methods that can be trained directly in real-world settings.<br/><br/>The project will create new theoretical frameworks and algorithms that integrate foundation models, which are large, pre-trained artificial intelligence models, into reinforcement learning. These models provide built-in knowledge about the world, enabling learning systems to acquire new skills more quickly, perform better in unfamiliar situations, and be deployed more rapidly in real-world environments. The research will focus on three core areas. First, it will establish formal methods for incorporating knowledge from foundation models into the state and action spaces of reinforcement learning agents, allowing them to leverage high-level abstractions and prior knowledge to inform decision-making. Second, it will derive theoretical analyses and provide performance guarantees, including bounds on sample complexity, generalization capability, and convergence rates, to demonstrate how these enhanced agents can learn more efficiently with fewer interactions in complex, real-world environments. Third, it will design new reinforcement learning algorithms that integrate foundation models to improve reward modeling, exploration strategies, and policy optimization, ensuring stability and robustness during both training and deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process generates ocean crust and is responsible for most of the volcanic eruptions on Earth. The presence of even small amounts of water in the mantle is known to have large effects on the amount of magma produced. Likewise, small changes in chemical composition of the mantle rocks will also change the amount of magma produced. This project will be the first to study both of these factors together. The project involves both laboratory experiments that replicate the conditions in the mantle and computational models that predict melting. Two graduate students will conduct each aspect of the project, respectively, but also will be cross-trained under the guidance of principle investigators. Several first-year undergraduates will also be involved in the research, leveraging an existing program at the University of Utah. The anticipated outcome of this research will be the first models that accurately predict the combined effect of water and composition variations on mantle melting. The project will also support making video tutorials to help with the adoption of the software developed in this project.<br/><br/>The presence of even small amounts of water and other volatiles can significantly alter the way that mantle rocks melt and how much magma is produced to form new crust and create volcanoes. Understanding the mantle melting processes from the composition of basalts produced is a very difficult problem, so laboratory experiments and computational modeling provide the best ways to address these questions. This project integrates high pressure-high temperature laboratory experiments and geochemical numerical models to investigate the impacts of variable water content on melting of a realistic mantle composition containing both peridotites and pyroxenites as they coexist in a decompressing, rising mantle plume. The project will develop the first model parameterization that can accurately predict the effects of water on melting a lithologically realistic mantle containing pyroxenites, and make publicly available open-source software to enable other researchers to run these models. The central hypothesis is that increasing both the abundance of pyroxenite and the concentration of water in the decompressing mantle will generate measurably deeper melting than either factor alone. Experimental data generated during the project will add significantly to the public Library of Experimental Phase Relations and the EarthChem national data repository. This project will enable two graduate students to continue their studies and will provide first-hand research experiences for freshmen students at University of Utah.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It explores its physical realization through an intelligent wearable exercise ""reminder"" system called ""Souvenir"" and an adaptive machine intelligence that optimizes personalized interventions. The system looks to deliver physical and textual smartphone ""nudges"" to motivate therapeutic exercise after a stroke. This work looks to address a significant problem: many stroke survivors habitually refrain from using their hemiparetic limbs despite retaining sufficient ability to move them, a phenomenon known as ""learned non-use"". Learned non-use limits a person's ability to perform activities essential for independent living. The project will conduct fundamental research needed to develop an explainable machine intelligence capable of assessing patient motivation in real time, adapting the challenge level of therapeutic activities based on those assessments and the patient's current ability, and cueing activities in an unobtrusive manner. By leveraging the behavioral science of motivation to increase compliance with prescribed exercise, the project looks to advance the mission of the National Science Foundation by promoting scientific progress and enhancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project also includes public outreach and educational activities designed to promote science literacy among students and the general public.<br/><br/>The current state-of-the-art treatment for addressing learned non-use after stroke is a two-week intensive intervention known as constraint-induced movement therapy, designed to engage a virtuous cycle of functional recovery. While this approach can lead to clinically meaningful improvements in paretic arm function that may persist for up to two years, most clinicians do not adopt it due to its high demands on time and lack of specialized training. A low-cost, low-burden alternative is urgently needed, one that both clinicians and patients will actually use. This project looks to advance the goals of the M3X program by conducting fundamental research in embodied reasoning (patient modeling and state estimation) as mediated by bidirectional sensorimotor interactions. This involves motion monitoring and the exchange of physical and textual cues between a human patient and a synthetic actor (Souvenir). The project will follow a user-centric design approach, iterating through computational modeling, software engineering, user focus groups, pilot testing, and assessment to develop and refine an explainable machine intelligence. This system seeks to assess patient motivation in real time and adapt the challenge level of therapeutic activities based on those assessments and the patient's current ability. The project concludes with a feasibility demonstration through human subject experiments, testing how an intelligent machine can influence individual human behaviors to optimize sensorimotor performance and recovery after stroke.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying these complexes can support a better fundamental understanding of chemical reactions and bonds. In addition to these objectives, this project aims to leverage this phenomenon for the discovery of next-generation catalysts, including photocatalysts. This multifaceted project will support catalyst development, produce knowledge in physical organic and inorganic chemistry, and contribute to the education and training of future scientists.<br/><br/>Encounter complexes, also referred to as outer complexes, are typically intermediates invoked in various reactions, including Lewis acid-base adduct formation. This project will specifically target adducts of Lewis acidic carbenium ions that can isomerize between their datively bound inner form and their more elusive outer form, where the donor-acceptor interaction is non-covalent. By tethering the Lewis-opposite functionalities, the work will show how the nature of the carbenium unit, the donor properties of the Lewis base, and the backbone structure can be used to adjust the respective energies of the inner and outer forms, which is a prerequisite for dynamic inner/outer isomerism. The project will also explore how such a phenomenon may be harnessed for the reversible masking of reactive carbenium ions and for their possible use in photoredox catalysis. Another aim will employ this inner/outer isomerism as a tool to adjust the redox properties of the main group functionality acting as the Lewis base, with the objective of increasing two-electron redox cycling at chalcogen and pnictogen centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While conventional deep neural networks struggle with them, multi-stream architectures are an emerging approach that has been shown to perform better. However, despite their potential, the broader adoption and advancement of multi-stream methods and models are limited by gaps in existing algorithms and their implementations, as well as a lack of foundational design knowledge. This project aims to address these shortcomings by integrating modern developments in deep learning with efficient algorithmic implementations to produce a library of state-of-the-art multi-stream models. The anticipated outcomes include: (1) a suite of high-performance multi-stream foundation models with applications to object detection, text-based image segmentation, and audio-video analysis; (2) optimized algorithms that enhance the efficiency of their internal mechanisms; (3) and new foundational knowledge to guide the design of future multi-stream systems.

The PIs and collaborators recently discovered a way of transforming these nonsymmetric versions in the same style as Garsia and Haiman did for the symmetric case.  Further study of these new polynomials will unearth new representation theoretic and combinatorial mysteries of nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New synthetic tools are being evaluated based on a universal reaction design concept that enables access to functionalized oxindoles, a type of structure present in a variety of biologically relevant molecules. The new synthetic tools employ selective transition-metal catalyzed reactions to make a variety of distinct changes to a single molecular intermediate in the presence of simple building blocks. While advancing methods for organic synthesis, this research program is also being used to train graduate students in synthetic chemistry and to engage undergraduate students in teaching labs through a molecular-target-specific pedagogical approach. These activities are being used to encourage students to consider careers in research and discovery.<br/><br/>Despite the ubiquitous presence of cycloannulated indole and oxindoles frameworks in medicinal chemistry and materials science, the number of reliable, efficient methods for diversifying these building blocks with flexible site-specific functionalization capabilities is relatively limited. Using these synthetic targets as motivating templates for reaction design, Prof. Ashfeld and his reaction team are using the difference in reactivity between PdII- and RhII-carbenoids to selectively favor [3+1]-, [3+2+1]-, and [4+3]-cycloadditions for the construction of key alkaloid frameworks. A central diazooxindole intermediate is being divergently functionalized using these methods and fundamental reactivity lessons learned about being used to expand the reactivity scope to the asymmetric synthesis of cyclobutenes, pyrans, and complex indole ring-systems, including the total synthesis of N-methylwelwitindolinone C isothiocyanate. The synthetic methods being developed also form the basis for a cohesive pedagogical approach toward laboratory instruction that will broadly impact STEM education efforts at all levels.

The QBO influences higher latitude phenomena such as the stability of the stratospheric polar vortex (the ?Holton-Tan effect?) that subsequently impacts the tropospheric mid-latitude jet stream.  As the QBO vertically propagates from the middle stratosphere to the tropopause, it also influences the position of the North Pacific jet as well as the variability in the tropical troposphere through its interactions with deep convection and the Madden-Julian oscillation. The persistence and quasi regular nature of the QBO offers the potential for predictability out to several years if well represented in global models. This study aims to provide insight into the longstanding model bias in QBO strength in the lower stratosphere, with the QBO being too weak in the models, and the inability of models to correctly capture the QBO modulation of the stratospheric polar vortex. The project includes the training of two graduate students in climate dynamics and provides research opportunities for undergraduate students in a STEM field. It additionally includes creating outreach materials for the University of Utah and the Natural History Museum of Utah on the QBO and its role in the climate system.<br/><br/>The main goals of the project, to better understand the weak QBO bias in the lower stratosphere in fully coupled models and the inability of these models to capture the Holtan-Tan effect, will be addressed using a simplified model of the stratosphere with a self-generating QBO. To test the leading theories regarding the weak QBO bias in the lower stratosphere, experiments isolating the effects of vertical resolution, varying tropical upwelling speeds, varying imposed tropical latent heating and gravity wave drag, and adjusting gravity wave sources will be performed. To better understand the interactions of the QBO with the stratospheric polar vortex additional experiments will be conducted focusing on the sensitivity of the Holton-Tan effect to polar vortex strength and the sensitivity of the polar vortex strength to the mean equatorial zonal wind vertical structure. The use of the simplified model offers the ability more clearly interpret the results compared to a fully coupled climate model and to perform a greater number of experiments at low computation cost. The graduate students will lead these experiments, with guidance from the lead investigator, offering training for the next generation of atmospheric scientists capable of addressing societally relevant issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent studies suggest that astrocytes, a different type of brain cell, may also play an important role. This project combines experiments and computational modeling to study how astrocytes contribute to brain function. Astrocytes affect many aspects of neuronal activity and communication, providing a potential mechanism by which they can alter signaling in the brain. The computational modeling and mathematical analysis within the project will enable a deeper biological understanding of these astrocyte-neuron interactions, generate new ideas for why they may be important for information processing in the brain, and suggest ways to integrate these principles into artificial intelligence systems. In conjunction with the modeling will be experiments to observe and manipulate astrocytes in living brains. In so doing, the project will validate new ideas about astrocytes' roles in the brain, providing an enhanced understanding of neural circuits and brain function. <br/><br/>The scientific premise of this project is the ""contextual guidance"" hypothesis, which postulates that astrocytes act as switchboards that transmit information about the environment and the physiological state of the organism to neurons and networks thereof. As such, astrocytes may act as a force multiplier that can expand the repertoire of dynamics that neurons can realize, thus enabling computation. The project will explore two ideas in this regard: (i) that astrocytes actively modulate neuronal dynamics in response to signals sensed from the environment, and (ii) this modulation enables neuronal networks to tailor their dynamics in response to context-specific circumstances. To substantiate these ideas, the project will investigate the role of astrocytes in neuromodulatory systems and subsequent effects on neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the project will examine network-level interaction between neurons and astrocytes, exploring features like ""tiling,"" where astrocytes overlay neuron clusters to influence signal routing. In addition to scientific insights, the research will examine how brain-inspired computing may be enhanced by new artificial neural network designs that incorporate astrocytes, with a focus on context-dependent computational paradigms. Additionally, the project includes initiatives to engage trainees in interdisciplinary neuroscience research and exchange, including new mini-courses that bridge neuroscience, engineering and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>A companion project is being funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The observations performed will include standard hydrographic and biological measurements along five transect lines that represent zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity. Sampling locations in each transect will be arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming. Satellite observations will also be used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentrations. Collectively, these measurements will extend a marine time-series that previously has revealed a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater and impacts on prey for larger marine mammals, seabirds and probably fish and shellfish.

The degradation or aging of battery is a natural process as the battery undergoes continuous charge and discharge process during service, limiting the battery?s capability of delivering rated energy and power. This natural degradation may also lead to a poor estimate of state of charge and state of health of the battery, posing safety concerns for demanding applications such as electric vehicles (EV), electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (e-VTOL), drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) etc. This project intends to address these challenges by utilizing high-frequency ultrasonic waves, which interact with anode, cathode and separator during propagation, and may provide meaningful information about battery degradation in real-time and in service conditions. This project will aid in formulating robust algorithms for battery health management systems, facilitating longer range and enhanced capabilities for mission critical systems.  The intellectual merit of the proposed research project includes advancing the current understanding of how ultrasonic guided wave signals propagate in lithium-ion pouch cell batteries, and how the information contained in the signal is affected by the evolution of anode and cathode mechanical property variation due to the transfer of lithium ions.  Using this understanding, and employing novel signal processing techniques, it will develop algorithms for monitoring the battery health and predicting the remaining useful life in a more robust and accurate way.  The broader impacts of the project include allowing the society to reap the benefits associated with all battery powered vehicles, increasing the safety and reliability of the associated systems by providing critical insights and methodology for developing a robust battery management system using ultrasonic waves.  It will also provide hands-on demos and training on battery cycling and stress wave propagation to secondary education teachers to augment existing curricula to inspire the rising generation into STEM careers.<br/><br/>Ultrasonic guided waves are stress waves propagating in solid materials, and their group velocity and phase velocity are functions of elastic modulus and density. Lithium-ion batteries undergo modulus and density evolution during the aging process, which can directly be inferred from the guided wave signals. This proposal hypothesizes that the lithium-ion battery is a time-varying system whose mechanical properties are functions of charge, discharge and aging process. Successive collections of ultrasonic signals from the battery can be thought of as response signals being collected at different frozen-time snapshots from the time-varying systems. Autoregressive model based modal analysis techniques can be invoked to extract physically meaningful parameters from the ultrasonic signals, that can subsequently be correlated with battery state of charge and battery aging and can be used as real-time measurements for the prediction of remaining useful life. Motivated by this transformative concept, this proposal aims at testing this hypothesis by answering the following questions. How ultrasonic guided wave signals (1) interact with anode, cathode and ion-transfer; (2) respond to battery aging and which parameters are most affected by battery aging; (3) how the extracted parameters can be used to develop real-time battery monitoring algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central goals of the project are to improve these constructions, to develop faster algorithms to operate on these lattices, and to build more efficient cryptographic applications using them.<br/><br/>The technical advances in this project concern number fields with small root discriminants. This project will study the computational complexity of constructing such number fields and of performing arithmetic operations in them. Prior work on infinite families of number fields with small root discriminants has focused on existence theorems. This project will build on work of two of the P.I.s on efficient explicit constructions of such families. The goal is to improve these constructions using a variety of mathematical techniques including Galois cohomology, explicit Chebotarev theorems and recent advances on Hilbert's 12th problem via p-adic methods and modular forms. Another goal is to develop fast Fourier methods for performing arithmetic operations of the kind needed in cryptography. The relevance of number fields with small root discriminants was noted by Peikert and Rosen in 2006. They showed that such fields lead to very small connection factors relating the difficulty of solving the worst case of the short vector problem to the difficulty of solving the average case of the short integer solution problem.

Markov chains play a pivotal role in theoretical computer science, enabling the development of sampling and approximate counting algorithms important in statistical physics and cryptography. Another important family of examples includes card shuffle sequences, which have intriguing connections to DNA rearrangements in biology. The main targets of study in this project are mixing times, cutoff, and limit profiles. The time it takes a physical system to reach equilibrium is an example of a mixing time. The cutoff phenomenon describes a phase transition during which the distance of a Markov chain from equilibrium very abruptly drops to near zero. The limit profile captures the limiting value of the distance to stationarity as the size of the state space grows to infinity. The research problems under investigation impact a spectrum of disciplines, including computer science, cryptography, physics, and biology, and the project also offers research opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The current research program aims at developing techniques for studying the cutoff phenomenon and determining the limit profile for important Markov chains. Mixing phenomena will be explored using tools from representation theory, combinatorics, and probability theory. The program focuses on a range of models, including particle systems, exclusion processes, random walks on groups, and card shuffling. The primary goal of the research is to develop versatile techniques for bounding mixing times and establishing the occurrence of the cutoff phenomenon. A significant part of the proposal concerns exclusion processes. These processes have evolved into some of the most widely studied particle systems across mathematical physics, probability theory, and combinatorics. Their applications span various domains, from modeling traffic congestion to simulating the motion of molecules in gases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main focus will be on longstanding conjectures concerning the fluctuations of these surfaces and the scaling limits of the models when positioned on a slope and on a hard wall. This project also provides research opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The first research direction concerns the 3D Ising model and its (2+1)D SOS approximation at low temperature, with boundary conditions that force these random surfaces to have a positive slope. It is widely believed that, above a slope, the low temperature rigidity of these surfaces will destabilize, and their scaling limits should be a Gaussian Free Field (GFF). Little progress has been made on this problem until a recent successful study of a variant of the SOS model. The project outlines a program building on this recent progress, aiming to establish a GFF limit for the true SOS model and, thereafter, 3D Ising. The second research direction focuses on the 3D Ising and (2+1)D SOS surfaces above a hard flat wall. The plan is to solve key questions, addressing the typical height and shape of the Ising surface in that setting, and the fluctuations of the SOS level lines. The third research direction aims to study the SOS model above a hard wall (as above) but with an added pinning/layering potential, competing with entropic repulsion effects.

However, there is a lack of tools available to study the biological mechanisms underlying how these environmental conditions drive disease onset and progression. The goal of this project is to develop lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as tools to study how oxygen levels and inflammation influence pregnancy health. These advances will uncover potential therapeutic strategies to treat diseases of pregnancy and other diseases characterized by low oxygen or excessive inflammation. This research is integrated with educational activities focused on providing early research exposure to increase scientific participation. Specifically, it will provide pathways for undergraduate students at a local community college to work on translational research, integrate the research objectives into undergraduate and graduate coursework, provide summer research opportunities for students, and prepare modules for K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop and use LNPs as tools to study the role of oxygen- or immune-related pathways during healthy and pathologic pregnancy. LNPs have been predominately used for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery to treat and vaccinate against diseases. This work aims to shift the paradigm of using LNPs as therapeutics to also being used as tools to study biological processes underlying healthy and pathologic tissues. Both oxygen levels and immune activity are intricately controlled throughout pregnancy to support healthy placenta development and function, and their dysregulation can lead to pregnancy-related pathologies throughout gestation. However, there is a severe lack of living models, and therefore a lack of treatment options, available to study the pathophysiology of these conditions. To fill this gap, this project will design LNPs that preferentially accumulate in the diseased placenta and use these LNPs to investigate key biological questions relating inflammation and hypoxia to placenta health. This work integrates both non-living and living components to form a fundamental understanding of the molecular drivers of pathophysiology of pregnancy. The successful completion of this work will uncover potential therapeutic avenues to treat diseases of pregnancy, which currently have very limited treatment options. Further, it establishes LNPs as tools for studying pathophysiology across numerous diseases driven by hypoxia or inflammation, revolutionizing the way diseases are studied and leading to the development of new therapeutic approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The very nature of the strong carbon-fluorine bond in these molecules makes them persist in the environment and the human body.  There is growing evidence that forever chemicals cause cancer and other diseases, and it is expected that stricter guidelines on the levels of PFASs allowed in drinking water will be implemented in the future.  Current methods for testing for PFASs in drinking water must be carried out off-site, rely on expensive specialized equipment, and have a turn-around time of days to months.  The TrueBlue sensing devices developed here will combine the ability of biological systems to recognize virtually any pollutant with high sensitivity combined with readout electronics in a small disposable ?dipstick? format; sensing can occur within 1-2 hours.  One of the research teams of this collaborative effort will design these hybrid bioelectronic devices to detect PFAS compounds using the latest advances in artificial intelligence.  This team?s efforts are complemented by a world-leading applied research team that has been working with the New York City (NYC) Department of Environmental Protection for nearly three decades to advance water resource recovery in NYC, one of the largest metropolitan regions in the world.  The intellectual merit of this project comes in delivering a transformative technology for detecting PFASs and other pollutants in water and advancing the design and application of hybrid bioelectronic devices using artificial intelligence.  The broader impacts span from improving human health by minimizing exposure to PFAS compounds in the environment to rich training opportunities for future generations of STEM researchers.    <br/>  <br/>This project seeks the convergence of the fields of synthetic biology, bioelectronics, machine learning, and water resources engineering to provide point-of-use sensors for assessing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water.

Current methods for testing for PFASs in drinking water must be carried out off-site, rely on expensive specialized equipment, and have a turn-around time of days to months.  In contrast, the TrueBlue biohybrid devices developed here can be utilized on-site and will use equipment that is 100-fold less expensive.  This transformation will be achieved by building an entirely new class of biohybrid device that co-opts the specificity of a yeast G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the sensitivity and remote sensing capabilities of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out devices, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to de novo design the GPCRs to recognize key PFAS compounds.

To make sense of this data, the scientific enterprise relies on new computational methods and computing infrastructure to realize new insights. In other words, the computational methods used for large scale data analysis are now tools of the scientific community as they are central to the knowledge generation process. This project aims to address a major limitation in large scale data analysis by designing and implementing novel methods that employ computational storage devices, which combine the storage inside of a computer with a configurable processor that resides on the storage device itself. This project will yield new insights into the efficient use of these computational storage devices and will demonstrate how they can be used to remedy the challenges faced in several scientific domains. The project will benefit society by training students in the use of cutting edge technologies that are of national importance and which have great potential to bolster the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>Computational storage devices are an emerging technology for accelerating large scale data intensive computations because they combine storage with field programmable gate arrays. Relocating computational tasks from the host processor to a computational storage device eliminates data movement between the computational storage device and the central processor unit's main memory over the bandwidth constrained system interconnect, thereby reducing traffic, saving energy, and reducing latency. Using this paradigm can result in unprecedented acceleration of scientific applications that process large datasets, have data dependent performance characteristics, and have non uniform data access patterns. This project will conduct a design space exploration for selected computational tasks in order to identify the kernels and design parameters that provide the best acceleration for a system with multi core CPUs equipped with computational storage devices. The project will design and implement several indexing data structures having a wide range of properties that make them suitable across numerous application scenarios that are optimized for computational storage devices. The project will create and disseminate a user friendly programming framework that provides data parallel primitives for computational storage devices including map, reduce, filter and join, and collective communication functions including scatter, gather, and all to all communication.

Organizations, such as companies, domain sciences, and government agencies, increasingly have numerous datasets, scattered in many locations. When starting a data science or AI project, users often must find a specific datasets, then analyze them to extract insights. However, finding the needed datasets among a ?sea of datasets? is often very difficult. So organizations increasingly use data catalogs for this purpose. A data catalog stores the names, descriptions, and other characteristics of datasets, as well the relationships among them. Users can then query the catalog to find desired datasets. As such, data catalogs have become a critical enabler for data science and AI projects. Yet the state of the art in catalog development has remained quite limited, leading to underwhelming performance that falls short of the users? needs. In particular, not enough attention is devoted to the ?pain points? of catalog users, and there is very little interaction among the research, vendor, user, and open-source tool communities. This has negatively impacted users, especially in domain sciences, with anecdotal evidence of intensive manual work to construct catalogs. This project seeks to address these limitations by first developing innovative and practical solutions for several pain points of catalog users, thereby accelerating research on these critical topics. Second, the project will combine these solutions to build SmartCat, a catalog software, and open-source SmartCat for educational and research purposes, and to serve domain science users. These technologies will facilitate the widespread deployment of data catalogs, resulting in better data science and AI for society, especially for domain sciences.  Findings from the project will be incorporated into a new course, a new textbook, and a proposed computing-oriented (CS+X) major for environmental sciences. This will help improve STEM education. Finally, the project will build on the above activities to promote bridges among stakeholder communities that work on data catalogs, thereby increasing partnership between academia, industry, and others. <br/><br/>Toward the above goals, this project considers a long-term agenda that spans the stakeholder communities (research, vendor, user, open-source tool) and applies Generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), to solve catalog problems. The project will develop solutions to (1) enrich datasets with many types of metadata, such as table and column name expansions, textual descriptions, and tags, (2) discover relationships among the datasets, such as unionable, joinable, and lineage relationships, and (3) help users find desired datasets via browsing, keyword search, and natural language querying. These solutions will significantly advance the state of the art in data catalog, data discovery, and data integration, as well as the application of Generative AI to data management. The project introduces new core problems that are serious ?pain points? for catalog users, but have received little attention from the research community. It considers problems that have been extensively studied, but points out the limitations of existing approaches, and proposes novel solutions. Like many current works, it also considers LLMs, but does so in the context of a real-world data management problem, namely data catalog.

One particular concern relates to the ""black-box"" nature of state-of-the-art AI models. These models are incredibly powerful, but they cannot be easily interpreted by humans. Lack of interpretability challenges the responsible use of AI - without model interpretability, human users cannot understand model decisions or correct model mistakes. This can have dire consequences, especially in critical, high-stakes settings. The goal of this project is to improve the interpretability of machine learning models in the context of computer vision. Specifically, this project will develop innovative technologies to allow machine learning-based computer vision models to explain their reasoning processes to human users, and to allow human users to interact with those models to correct their mistakes. By fostering a two-way dialogue between AI and human users, the technologies developed in this project will not only lead to computer vision models with improved interpretability to human users but will also empower users to make more informed decisions. At the same time, the developed technologies will facilitate continuous improvement of computer vision models based on feedback from human users and will lead to more accurate models with refined reasoning processes.<br/><br/>This project will advance interpretable machine learning by creating new interpretable models and techniques for computer vision. It will lead to: 1) multimodal interpretable models that unify various forms of interpretability, such as prototype-based interpretability and natural language explanations; 2) interpretable generative models, which can explain the image generation process to human users; 3) interpretable reinforcement learning techniques that can be used to train interpretable policies based on their interactions with the environment; and 4) human-AI interaction techniques that will allow human users to interact with interpretable models to correct mistakes in the models' reasoning and improve the quality of model predictions and explanations. The research effort will push the boundaries of interpretable machine learning, by unifying various forms of interpretability, by extending the use of interpretable machine learning to generative modeling and to reinforcement learning, and by bringing human-AI interaction to a new level. This project also comes with an integrated education component, which will lead to lesson plans that integrate interpretable machine learning, as well as the ethical and responsible use of AI, into high school classrooms. The education effort will bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and K-12 classrooms and will inspire the next generation of AI scientists.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Robust Intelligence Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these results promise new applications in operator theory and operator algebras.  For example, our new combinatorial results suggest a statistical treatment of certain families of approximately finite dimensional algebras.  Certain multivariate symmetric polynomials that arise in this work gives rise to random vector norms, which connect traces of noncommutative *-polynomials to combinatorics and probability theory.  Continuing the combinatorial theme, symmetrized tensor products of certain non-normal operators provide an exciting new sandbox for function-theoretic operator theorists.

There, icebergs break off, drifting towards lower latitudes and warmer waters. Along the way the icebergs melt and the rock fragments sink to the seafloor, leaving behind a trail of these rock fragments called ice rafted debris. Ice rafted debris accumulates at the bottom of the ocean and over time preserves a record of activity at their source, the Antarctic ice sheet. In this study investigators will use sediment cores recovered in the Indian Ocean by the Ocean Drilling Program to reconstruct the accumulation of ice rafted debris over time. The drill site is about 500 miles north of the Antarctic continent, and in the path of the ice bergs that it sheds. When looking at the variations in ice rafted debris over time, the team will obtain a record of changes in the glacial activity of the Antarctic ice sheet through time. The study is motivated by the mystery surrounding changes in glacial activity in response to changes in the shape of Earth?s orbit around the sun, the wobble of its axis, and the degree of the tilt of the Earth?s axis, the so-called Milankovitch cycles. For a period of time between about 1.2 and 1.6 million years ago, it is not clear if ice sheet growth and melt responded to changes in incoming solar energy related to changes in the shape of the orbit or to changes in its tilt toward or away from the sun. This study will contribute data to help understand how these external mechanisms cause variations in the size and behavior of Antarctic ice sheets. Investigators will conduct this research alongside a number of undergraduate students and one graduate student. Records of ice rafted debris provide an ideal teaching tool as they are reasonably easy to assemble by students independently (after initial training) and thus provide students with a sense of self-reliance and self-confidence, increasing their motivation to remain in a STEM related field. Thus, ice rafted debris is an ideal proxy to teach students about paleoclimate and paleoceanography. Broader impacts activities include training and mentoring undergraduate students and a graduate student, outreach with a local middle school, and efforts to expand access in STEM.<br/><br/>Legacy Ocean Drilling Program Site 745B - drilled during Leg 119 in 1988 south of the polar front in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean - provides a rare opportunity to study paleoclimate at the full orbital scale back into the late Miocene (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1989) in a vastly understudied region of the world ocean. Investigators propose to construct records of ice rafted debris (IRD) to infer Antarctic ice margin dynamics during the early Pleistocene (~1.1-1.8 Ma) and during specific late Pleistocene interglacial intervals (Marine Isotope Stages 1,5, 7, 11, and 15). Recently, orbital-scale resolution records of biogenic opal and magnetic susceptibility have been tuned to the Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) oxygen isotope stack unlocking the site?s full potential for paleoceanographic reconstructions. With the early Pliocene record, the team will test the hypothesis that the dominance of 41 kyr ice volume fluctuations observed during this interval of time is an artifact of the oxygen isotope proxy. Precession-related variations in the IRD record would support interhemispheric cancellation of the precession signal in oxygen isotope records. Dominance of obliquity would suggest that fluctuations in marine-terminating ice sheets did occur on this time scale. With the late Pleistocene interglacial intervals, which correspond to different amplitudes of obliquity versus precession in insolation forcing, investigators will examine the response of marine terminating ice margins under these different conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent studies suggest that astrocytes, a different type of brain cell, may also play an important role. This project combines experiments and computational modeling to study how astrocytes contribute to brain function. Astrocytes affect many aspects of neuronal activity and communication, providing a potential mechanism by which they can alter signaling in the brain. The computational modeling and mathematical analysis within the project will enable a deeper biological understanding of these astrocyte-neuron interactions, generate new ideas for why they may be important for information processing in the brain, and suggest ways to integrate these principles into artificial intelligence systems. In conjunction with the modeling will be experiments to observe and manipulate astrocytes in living brains. In so doing, the project will validate new ideas about astrocytes' roles in the brain, providing an enhanced understanding of neural circuits and brain function. <br/><br/>The scientific premise of this project is the ""contextual guidance"" hypothesis, which postulates that astrocytes act as switchboards that transmit information about the environment and the physiological state of the organism to neurons and networks thereof. As such, astrocytes may act as a force multiplier that can expand the repertoire of dynamics that neurons can realize, thus enabling computation. The project will explore two ideas in this regard: (i) that astrocytes actively modulate neuronal dynamics in response to signals sensed from the environment, and (ii) this modulation enables neuronal networks to tailor their dynamics in response to context-specific circumstances. To substantiate these ideas, the project will investigate the role of astrocytes in neuromodulatory systems and subsequent effects on neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the project will examine network-level interaction between neurons and astrocytes, exploring features like ""tiling,"" where astrocytes overlay neuron clusters to influence signal routing. In addition to scientific insights, the research will examine how brain-inspired computing may be enhanced by new artificial neural network designs that incorporate astrocytes, with a focus on context-dependent computational paradigms. Additionally, the project includes initiatives to engage trainees in interdisciplinary neuroscience research and exchange, including new mini-courses that bridge neuroscience, engineering and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>A companion project is being funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include escalating construction costs, limited access to federal funding, diseconomies of scale, and turbid source waters due to more frequent storms. Exacerbating these hurdles is the lack of affordable drinking water treatment options. Small public water systems need access to technology that makes it easier and less expensive to treat water, financing that eases the burden of capital costs, and capacity-building to ensure reliable delivery of safe drinking water. VersaWater - a collaboration of researchers and practioners - offers a community-centered approach for water treatment that will increase the number of Americans with access to safe clean drinking water. Specifically, VersaWater offers a community-centered approach for the implementation of reliable and safe water treatment. These systems are electricity-free prefabricated water treatment plants (WTPs), designed to reliably treat turbid waters at a lower cost using gravity power alone. These systems have elegantly simple flow control, chemical dosing, self-cleaning features and easy to replace parts. VersaWater's implementation process includes support for the community in accessing federal funds, regulatory compliance, and hands-on learning for system's operators and managers. VersaWater does the behind-the-scenes work of converging the right partners to accompany small communities on the path to achieving safe water access, providing what they need through one organization (a ""utility-in-a-box""). As a result, Versawater is addressing a public health gap and critical water security issues in the United States. The project advances scientific knowledge in water treatment while supporting sustainable and resilient water infrastructure.<br/><br/>By combining cutting-edge research with a comprehensive, participatory implementation process, VersaWater sets a standard for addressing global water access challenges effectively and equitably. The VersaWater team has developed an implementation framework for VersaWater's prefabrication technology, which will be refined through a piloting process in Phase 2. VersaWater's next phase of work is organized into four core components structured as a series of pilots. Each component is designed to progressively increase community involvement and external investment. Workforce development will occur concurrently through several training opportunities. A Demonstration Plant serving 250 people (PF250) will be installed at an educational institution for learning and training. The PF250 produces 18,000 gallons of drinking water per day complete with an automated coagulant doser to enable operators to spend less time on-site and decrease operation costs. A Cohort 0 will be comprised of two small water systems in Puerto Rico (PR). PR small water systems experience disproportionately high poverty rates and challenging treatment conditions caused by climate-related storms. These installs will be accompanied by simulated applications for funding to develop capacity. Cohort 1 will be comprised of PR and rural Northeastern U.S. small water systems. Communities will be guided through submissions of applications for shovel-ready implementation projects to federal funders. After this Cohort, VersaWater plans to be in operation mode and expanding its ""utility in a box"" implementations year after year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, a user executing a web search will increasingly rely on LLMs to summarize their search results, rather than viewing individual web pages, and they might use LLMs to ?talk to? long documents like financial reports, rather than reading them in their entirety. To support these new paradigms, it is important that an LLM be able to generate responses that are factual, informative and safe. However, satisfying these criteria is not sufficient: a response should also be at the right level of abstraction or detail, in the right format, creative where appropriate, and aligned with other user needs. Current practice has neglected evaluation of these more subtle factors. This project proposes to address these shortcomings by identifying a set of ?evaluation concepts? to indicate the kinds of areas where LLMs are failing, like ?lack of detail in a list.? The project will then develop technology for automatically evaluating and improving LLM responses according to these concepts.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve the evaluation and the functionality of LLMs in two ways. First, the project will discover a concept taxonomy and learn how to evaluate LLM responses according to the concepts in that taxonomy. This process will necessitate advances in reward models, which are themselves LLM, customized to reliably score responses. Second, these reward models are applied to actually improve the LLMs? responses. Specifically, the project will curate training data exhibiting the correct kinds of behavior for each concept, enabling training of LLMs that do better on those concepts. Finally, the project will develop methods for iteratively improving responses using our reward models. The project will open-source the concept taxonomy and reward models that will outperform closed-source, proprietary models. These models will enable the public to have a better sense of the performance of LLM systems across a variety of applications, and will drive the open-source community to build stronger, more reliable LLM systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wildfire damage to infrastructure and ecosystems is rising. It is possible to coexist with wildfires if decision makers consider fire behavior and take adaptive approaches, such as wildland fuel reductions and community home hardening. Knowledge of where and when adaptive approaches are needed requires a clear understanding of how wildfire propagates at multiple scales under different weather scenarios. Although researchers have made a substantial effort to model wildfire behavior at different scales, until recently, they knew little about how fires behave once they enter communities. Wildfire propagation models offer a unique opportunity to link fire behaviors on the global scale all the way to the individual-building level in communities. Making this link will allow for more effective wildfire management that couples fuel reduction and home hardening strategies tailored to account for the physical, social, ecological, and economic characteristics of each community. <br/><br/>This project will establish a framework to merge characteristics of the built environment with those of wildlands to improve models of fire risk in fire-prone communities. The research will start by linking wildfire models to simulate the behavior of fire at different scales - from a global domain to the community level. In addition, the approach to wildfire risk modeling will consider houses as drivers of fire, rather than simply recipients of fire. This will be achieved using a new community wildfire propagation model, AGNI-NAR ? Asynchronous Graph Nexus Infrastructure for Network Assessment of Wildland-Urban Interface Risk. AGNI-NAR is as a decision-making tool that captures fire interaction between vegetation and structures to allow stakeholders to make informed wildfire fuel and home hardening decisions at the wildland, individual property, and community landscape levels. Recognizing that every community is unique, the project will seek to co-produce actionable solutions using the wildfire models through iterative engagement with key stakeholders in the study areas to identify socially acceptable mitigation scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum entanglement is at the heart of technologies such as quantum computing, and is also crucial to several unusual properties of materials at low temperatures. However, entanglement is typically fragile, i.e., easily disrupted by interactions with a quantum system's environment. One of the key questions, therefore, concerns the phenomena occurring precisely at the boundary where quantum entanglement is lost, giving way to intuition familiar in everyday life. Such ""phase transitions"" remain poorly understood, especially in systems composed of a macroscopic number of interacting electrons. This project will focus on such transitions in a variety of contexts, ranging from materials where electrons are strongly entangled with each other, to ""quantum hard drives"", systems which can serve as storage space for information exploiting entanglement.<br/><br/>The PI will utilize a combination of analytical tools and state-of-the-art numerical simulations to explore the research.

This workshop will emphasize back-of-the-envelope calculations inspired by everyday phenomena and will also introduce fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, including applications such as quantum computing.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project addresses questions at the intersection of quantum condensed matter physics, quantum information theory, and statistical mechanics by focusing on scenarios where one macroscopic quantum subsystem acts as a bath for another one, leading to an interesting exchange of quantum entanglement between the two subsystems. One broad aspiration is to foster deeper connections between fruitful concepts from ground-state physics and emerging insights from the study of open quantum systems. For example, consider a composite system where electrons are weakly entangled with quantum spins that are in a topologically ordered state. One can imagine a scenario where the electrons act as a quantum bath for the spins leading to an information-theoretic phase transition where the topological order residing in the spin system is destroyed without any singularity in local correlation functions. Another example is a topologically ordered system where quantum fluctuations in the ground state driven by some parameter, say, a magnetic field, are superimposed on the fluctuations driven by decoherence. What is the global phase diagram of such a system? Can the combination of decoherence and quantum fluctuations lead to new phases that cannot exist if only one of them is present? Finally, motivated by the broad theme of quantum baths, the PI will also study phase transitions in heavy-fermion systems where the entanglement between the spins and the electrons can lead to analogs of a topologically ordered ""symmetric mass generation"" phase. The PI will explore the analogs of such phases also in open quantum systems.<br/><br/>To make progress on the above themes, the PI will utilize a combination of tools such as renormalization group, Quantum Monte Carlo and mapping to solvable models in various limits. Many of the concepts explored in this project are inspired by interdisciplinary exchanges among quantum condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum information science, and addressing the questions posed here is expected to further enhance their mutual synergy. Moreover, progress on these topics is anticipated to have practical implications for advancing quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum memory devices. Graduate students supported by this proposal will actively lead and carry out a substantial portion of the described research. To broaden societal engagement, the PI will organize an annual multi-session physics workshop designed specifically for high-school students.

Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) has emerged as a key network technology to provide high-bandwidth, low-latency communication for distributed ML and fast data storage. This project explores an RDMA-based campus network design and implementation that enables the shared use of distributed, heterogeneous Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate scientific applications and fast access to research data storage.<br/><br/>The project entails four research thrusts. First, high-bandwidth, low-latency RDMA network infrastructure will be established to connect campus GPUs using standard data center-class network hardware. Second, new workload scheduling systems and algorithms will be developed to make efficient usage of the RDMA network. Third, storage disaggregation over RDMA will be enabled, allowing compute servers to access remote NVMe-class storage with minimal performance overheads. Finally, varied science applications, such as large language models (LLMs), domain-specific natural language processing (NLP), medical image processing, and cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) will be evaluated on top of the RDMA network, the workload scheduler, and the disaggregated storage.<br/><br/>This project presents a first step toward improving the efficiency and utilization of Duke University's compute infrastructure by connecting centralized and individual GPU servers via a high-speed RDMA network. It is expected to reduce the time, effort, and financial burden that researchers typically face in enabling the scaling of scientific workloads in a number of scientific fields including but not limited to ML and LLMs, biomedical imaging, and molecular dynamics. The project will contribute to workforce development by training graduate and undergraduate students in high-performance computing, network optimization, and large-scale data management.<br/><br/>Software artifacts, papers, and tutorials developed as part of this project will be released on the following website https://sites.duke.edu/dream/.

The ability to modify and control material structures, and understand their structure-property relationships can lead to exciting scientific discoveries and new technologies. In addition to pushing the boundaries of science, such advances lead to the improved prosperity of society. An important family of oxide materials are perovskite oxides. The structure and functional properties of these materials can be modified by different synthesis methods. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research and the Office of Strategic Initiatives, Prof. Ramezanipour at the University of Louisville, investigates the incorporation of oxygen-vacancies into perovskite oxides, where some of the positions that would typically be occupied by oxygen atoms are vacant. The distribution of these vacant sites in the material structure can be either random or ordered. In this project, several hypotheses are evaluated in an effort to understand how the ordering of oxygen-vacancies can be induced and controlled. Several chemical principles are used, such as the effect of electronic properties and geometric stability. Based on these criteria, a wide range of oxygen-deficient perovskites with different vacancy-arrangements and ordering patterns are synthesized, helping to establish guidelines for rational design of vacancy-ordered materials. Broader impacts of this project include training student researchers, enhancing undergraduate students? laboratory skills, and outreach activities aimed at motivating high school students to pursue higher education, particularly in STEM fields. <br/><br/><br/>Technical summary<br/> <br/>This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research and the Office of Strategic Initiatives, establishes guidelines for rational design of vacancy-ordered structures in oxygen-deficient perovskites and their derivatives. These studies are motivated by remarkable properties of this family of materials, which are different from those of stoichiometric systems. The research is built around several hypotheses, based on fundamental chemistry considerations, to explore the formation and arrangement of oxygen-vacancies. Methods of tuning the concentration of oxygen-vacancies are studied to obtain perovskite-based oxides with different degrees of vacancies. Several types of ordering can be realized in oxygen-deficient perovskites, each leading to different types of coordination, such as tetrahedral, square-pyramidal, and octahedral, for metal cations within the material lattice. In this project, these different ordering-types are investigated, and the principal investigator and his research group explore several factors  as potential parameters that affect the ordering of oxygen-vacancies. A series of experimental techniques are used to obtain the target materials and investigated by an array of state-of-the art characterization methods. Overall, the researchers use a combination of compositional and synthetic considerations to develop design principles for the realization of each type of ordering in oxygen-deficient perovskites, which might enable new materials for various technological applications, thereby increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.

Such events also cause severe disruptions to agriculture, infrastructure, energy delivery and use, industrial activity, and fisheries. To better protect life, property, and food sources, it is in the national interest to provide policymakers and local and regional stakeholders with the reliable information they need to make informed decisions. The provision of such information requires Earth system model simulations that can run fast at increasingly finer scales on emerging computational platforms. In addition, advancing the scientific understanding of the processes occurring at these scales and how they feed back to the larger scales is needed. The project aims to address this Earth system modeling challenge by advancing the capabilities of one of the most widely used Earth system models through the creation of optimized configurations of its ocean component that can run efficiently on advanced supercomputers. The project will make a crucial contribution to the Earth system model, providing critical information at local and regional scales and enhancing the planet's resilience to natural hazards. The project will support the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the broader research, policymaking, and stakeholder communities, through specific classes, tutorials, and workshops.<br/><br/>The project creates an innovative cyberinfrastructure for the latest version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM3), particularly for its ocean component, Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6).

Inhalation of these aerosols can trigger respiratory and/or cardiovascular responses in people living along the coast, negatively impacting their health. Testing the hypothesis involves a coordinated approach that uses water sampling and analysis for algal bloom toxins, air quality, and aerosol sampling and analysis, as well as the field deployment of high frequency soil redox sensors and real-time monitoring, sample processing, and outreach during bloom events. The study area selected is around Lake Erie and near the city of Toledo, Ohio which gets it drinking water from the Lake. This area has repeatedly been impacted by harmful algal blooms in recent years. The research team is interdisciplinary and includes involvement by an expert in soil geophysics. It also includes medical personnel, one of whom is an expert in lung inflammation and clinical translation and one who is an expert in high-resolution toxin analysis. The work also involves collaboration with the Great Lakes Center which is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and National Institutions of Environmental Health Sciences. Broader impacts of the work include improving understanding of health conditions caused or exacerbated by harmful algal blooms in coastal settings and moving geoscience research results quickly and directly to health practitioners to provide more timely and faster incorporation into improved condition treatment and public health interventions. The research also supports an early career researcher and postdoctoral fellow, increasing the interaction between geoscience and medical/health practitioners. <br/><br/>In the Great Lakes region, harmful algal blooms are a seasonal concern due to the release of toxins called microcystins into the water. These toxins can harm human health. Harmful algal blooms are influenced by wetting and drying cycles in the soil and can concentrate microcystins in the soil during drying episodes. Evidence suggests that inhaling airborne aerosols containing algal toxins may be a significant route of exposure and trigger negative respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in coastal populations. This is because toxic algae-related hydrophobic congeners (microcystins) appear to be disproportionately enriched in water-rich aerosols due to their affinity for surfactant-stabilized bubble films. Preliminary data indicate that inhaling aerosols containing these toxins can provoke strong inflammatory responses in lung tissue. Thus, causing serious health implications. This study investigates how environmental changes, such as seiches (the swashing of coastal waters up over coastal lands) and heavy rain influence the release and airborne spread of microcystins in coastal areas. The project uses specialized soil sensors and air samplers to sample impacted coastal soils and waters in areas affected by harmful algal blooms. The analysis of these data are used to determine whether changes in soil characteristics and composition due to wetting and drying increase the likelihood of airborne toxins and people's exposure to them. The findings will provide valuable insights into the development of more effective public health strategies in regions prone to harmful algal blooms. The study addresses a critical gap at the intersection of soil biogeochemistry, atmospheric science, and public health by exploring how soil chemistry may influence airborne toxin risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Measuring particle size is a common method in the Earth Sciences. This technique is used to determine sediment transport in river systems, travel distance of volcanic ash, and to reconstruct past environments. Centrifugation uses rapid, motorized spinning of samples to mechanically separate different minerals from each other and to rinse solvents from sediments. These instruments will give both undergraduate and graduate students first-hand experience conducting lab work- from learning lab protocols and running samples independently to analyzing data. Hands-on data collection and analysis are skills that will better prepare them for future careers in the geosciences. <br/><br/>This grant proposal is for the acquisition of a laser diffraction particle size analyzer and a benchtop centrifuge. Currently there is not an available particle size analyzer within 300 miles of the Cal Poly Humboldt campus, which means we need to send samples to outside labs for analysis. This is costly, time consuming and deprives both undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to gain experience using lab instrumentation.  Determining particle size is an important measurement in many aspects of the Earth Sciences. For example, it can characterize the energy level of the depositional environment in a lake, be used to interpret aspects of a volcanic eruption such as eruption volume and transport mechanics of pyroclastic currents, be used in fault characterization in paleo-seismic trenching surveys, and help determine provenance of ancient fluvial sands. Additionally, processing samples using a benchtop centrifuge is an integral part of mineral separation in thermochronology using minerals such as zircon and apatite. California State Polytechnic University Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt), is the California State University (CSU) system?s third polytechnic and only one in Northern California. The new revised mission includes providing hands-on learning opportunities to better prepare students to solve the challenges of our time. Cal Poly Humboldt is dedicated to addressing workforce shortages in the sciences. Although Cal Poly Humboldt is set in one of the most unique natural geological settings which offers a natural laboratory for students and faculty, it is the most geographically isolated campus in the CSU system. This grant will directly impact faculty and students by acquiring in-house instrumentation to centrifuge samples and measure particle size from various sources, providing direct, hands-on opportunities for research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sargassum quickly began to disrupt fishing, tourism, nearshore ecosystems, and even caused health problems for populations exposed to rotting sargassum seaweed. Sargassum arrives on shore mixed with plastic trash and can be difficult and costly to clean up. An estimated 5-13 million tons of plastic enters the ocean each year, and sargassum blooms are estimated at over 20 million tons each year. While there have been increased efforts to track, collect, and create valuable products out of sargassum, research and development has vastly ignored the connection between sargassum and ocean plastics. This IRES project investigates plastic-sargassum interactions in the ocean and develops valuable products from sargassum-plastic pollution, such as concrete and composite lumber, for the building and construction industry. Simultaneously, this project trains U.S. students in innovation and international collaborations through mentored research experiences in the Dominican Republic. <br/><br/>This research progresses through three of the most prominent challenges in creating valuable products from sargassum-plastic pollution: tracking, collection, and product development. One of the main challenges facing management of sargassum is tracking seasonal flows: when will the seaweed blooms reach shore, where will they arrive, and in what quantities? This project uses satellite and aerial images to map and measure sargassum flows and then correlates this data with plastic information taken from field measurements. Collection is usually slow and costly, as it is mostly performed manually and with small-scale equipment. This project designs and tests new methods for collecting and processing that are best suited to delivering sargassum-plastic material in the quantities and condition best suited for development of value-add construction and building products. Finally, product development ensures profitability and feasibility by designing technologies that do not require extensive preparation of sargassum-plastic waste. This project investigates the use of pyrolysis -a process that uses high temperatures to break down sargassum-plastic pollution- to upcycle sargassum-plastic wastes. Pyrolysis creates waxes, chemicals, and char that can then be used to make composite lumber and concrete. The development of pyrolysis as a feedstock agnostic recycling technique that results in high value products is considered of utmost importance for plastic recycling, since sorting, transportation and impurities are often barriers in the recycling industry. This research develops new methods and techniques to produce concrete and composite lumber products, which will help drive the economics for collection and management of harmful sargassum-plastic reaching US and Caribbean shores. Research is primarily conducted by U.S. collegiate student trainees; as such this project trains these students to be globally aware and internationally capable of collaborating and innovating to support the U.S. to remain at the forefront of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The student training program includes topics such as advanced research methods, science communication, and collaborating on international teams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will support early career scientists (junior faculty members, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students) from the United States to attend the meeting. In short, this award will help provide a forum that is vital for the continued growth of the EvoDevo community. A community that is essential to the progress and innovation in several fields, including those directly relevant to human development and health.<br/><br/>The NSF funding for the PASEDB meeting provides the society with the ability to bring early career scientists (assistant professors), postdoctoral associates as well as graduate and undergraduate students from the United States to the biennial meeting. Scientific sessions include topics such as genomic basis of developmental evolution, the developmental origins of novelty, emerging research organisms, developmental biology in a changing world, cell biology in EvoDevo, neuro EvoDevo, new tools in EvoDevo, development and evolution, education in EvoDevo, external influences on development, genetic basis of trait variation, and comparative omics. The organizing committee has planned for a venue to conduct lively poster sessions that offer important opportunities for early career scientists to share their work in progress. Importantly, many students are attending their first conference or presenting preliminary results for the first time in this welcoming atmosphere and inspiring setting. Attendees will also be able to participate in workshops designed to address professional development, and successful strategies in academia such as ?mentoring students and postdocs?, successful delivery of chalk talks and teaching demos during job interviews? and ?how to succeed in teaching in your first year?. These are critical topics for increasing recruitment and retention of trainees and new faculty in the field. Finally, the meeting will feature an all-postdoc symposium to showcase future PIs in the field and offer an early career award for new EvoDevo faculty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project advances the development of socially-aware language technology by building bridges between experts in language science (including linguists) and technology (including computer scientists). This is an important advancement because it fosters a better scientific understanding of human language use and how to implement those principles in AI systems. Broader impacts include activities that bring computer scientists and linguists together for collaboration and mentoring activities to train new researchers in this area. <br/><br/>The field of pragmatics explores interactive, context-sensitive, and discourse-level aspects of language. Although there has been progress in computational modeling of pragmatics and a growing body of applied computational work, for the most part language scientists and computer scientists have been working independently. This conference provides opportunities for computational linguists and natural language processing researchers to share ideas. Conference topics reflect many aspects of pragmatics including informativity, perspective-taking, image captioning, discourse coherence, mutual knowledge in dialogue, and emotion analysis. To maximize attendance, the conference is co-located with two established scientific gatherings. Virtual attendance, participation, and presentation are supported by an established video platform. Events consist of both invited and contributed presentations in addition to a pop-up mentoring event for trainees and other scholars that supports access to computational experts outside of the home institution.

CECs include chemicals that are found in everyday products like cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and cleaning products and end up in oceans through wastewater or recreational activities. Their photodegradation mechanisms in saltwater environments, particularly in the sub-nanosecond timescales on which environmentally toxic intermediates are expected to form, remain largely elusive. Professor Karsili and his team will use quantum chemistry and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy to investigate how common CECs photodegrade in bulk seawater solutions and at the air-sea interface. Their studies could contribute to the fundamental understanding of the photodegradation mechanisms of common CECs in marine relevant environments and could provide detailed information on the environmental impact of CECs when discharged into surface waters. The educational and outreach efforts of the project include the use of virtual reality to help undergraduates visualize complex chemical concepts and hosting a computational chemistry summer camp for local high school students.<br/><br/>CECs are mostly lipophilic, meaning they preferentially accumulate at the air-water interface as well as within the bulk aqueous phase. The Karsili research group will develop machine-learning (ML) potentials trained using high-level GPU-accelerated quantum chemical data. These ML potentials will be integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics to predict Henry?s law solubility constants for a range of common CECs in seawater and to simulate the excited-state dynamics of photoexcited CECs both in bulk seawater and at the air-seawater interface. To validate and these results, the team will conduct femtosecond pump-probe laser spectroscopy experiments on representative CECs in both synthetic and natural seawater ? focusing on the vital femtosecond to nanosecond timescale on which potentially toxic intermediates are formed. Fieldwork in collaboration with NOAA?s Southeast Fisheries Science Center will involve seawater sample collection along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Educational efforts include integrating the simulations into virtual reality (VR) platforms to produce interactive, open-source teaching tools that visualize abstract physical chemistry concepts. The project will also establish a summer boot camp in computational chemistry for high school students, promoting early STEM engagement and supporting transitions to college-level science education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These difficulties create a critical bottleneck in the development of high-performance computing systems, leading to increased costs, longer time-to-market, and underutilized hardware. This solution addresses these challenges by enabling engineers to simulate and evaluate chip designs significantly faster while maintaining high accuracy. This advance has the potential to improve productivity for thousands of engineers, shorten development cycles for new technologies, and reduce infrastructure needs. In doing so, the technology supports national efforts to advance semiconductor innovation, enhance energy-efficient computing, and strengthen domestic design capabilities in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

Existing externally worn prosthetic thumbs do not yet meet patient needs for a device that restores thumb length, form, appearance, and touch sensation. Surgical reconstruction methods such as digit transfer or bone grafting require more surgeries and sacrifices than many patients are willing to make. An endoprosthetic thumb is expected to restore more natural function, comfort, and appearance than external prostheses without the need to harvest healthy donor tissue. Consequently, patients will have better overall functional ability, employment opportunities, independence, confidence, satisfaction, and well-being. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

These so-called subduction zone earthquakes can trigger tsunamis and cause widespread damage, but scientists still cannot predict when they will occur. The most damaging events happen rarely, often centuries apart in a region, and their observations are scarce and rely on indirect inference. While physics-based models of subduction zones help explain these phenomena, they struggle to capture how small and large earthquakes interact over a wide range of timescales. To better understand megathrust systems and assess hazards, this project will develop new computational tools that combine real-world geophysical observations and models based on physics. The research team will study major earthquakes in Chile, Japan, and Alaska that occurred over the past 20 years to investigate their immediate and long-lasting impacts in these regions. Through partnerships with local organizations and teachers, the team will develop community-oriented learning materials for university courses as well as high schools and organize outreach events. The project will support and train undergraduate interns, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scholar, contributing to training and inspiring the next-generation geoscience workforce.<br/><br/>This project will advance state-of-the-art methods for inferring and modeling megathrust faulting processes across timescales ranging from seconds to centuries after the initial earthquake ruptures in three major subduction zones. Using Bayesian inference techniques, the team will determine the kinematic properties of large earthquakes using seismic, geodetic, and tsunami data, enabling exploration of rupture properties and predictive analysis of crustal deformation and stress changes. These model ensembles will serve as inputs for multi-physics models incorporating laboratory-based rock friction and rheology to forecast the longer-term evolution of deformation and stress in three-dimensional Earth structures, accompanied by rigorous uncertainty quantification. The team will use these outputs to investigate how earthquakes of different sizes are connected, how fault zone processes relate to geological structure, and how interseismic fault coupling influences future seismic events. The research will illuminate fault stress and strength heterogeneity and controlling factors of subduction zone seismogenesis, with the resulting datasets and modeling tools benefiting future research in earthquake science and engineering and other disciplines. Project outcomes will include physics-based estimates for plausible hazard scenarios and probabilistic forecasts of deformation and aftershocks for selected high-risk subduction zones. Through collaboration with local communities in Chile, these estimates and projections of future hazards will inform policy decisions, ultimately contributing to mitigating economic and human losses from subduction zone hazards.

As the U.S. population continues to age, the prevalence of irregular heart rhythms, particularly atrial fibrillation, is rising significantly. This condition increases the risk of stroke due to clot formation in a small outpouching of the heart known as the left atrial appendage. While oral medications to prevent clotting are effective for many, a substantial portion of patients (up to one in five) are ineligible due to contraindications such as high bleeding risk. Without a safe and effective alternative, these patients face elevated risks of life-threatening complications. Existing mechanical closure devices are rigid and metallic, often poorly suited to the highly variable anatomical structure of the left atrial appendage, and have been linked to adverse outcomes. This project explores a new approach involving a soft, adaptable closure method intended to improve patient safety, reduce healthcare costs, and increase access to life-saving stroke prevention for a vulnerable patient population.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

This project aims to strengthen national cybersecurity by developing effective, adaptive, and collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) specifically designed for edge environments. By enabling edge devices to share threat knowledge securely and retain critical information about past attacks, the research contributes to more resilient and sustainable network protection. The outcomes will advance scientific knowledge in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, support public safety and national defense, and provide educational and outreach opportunities to equip the next generation of engineers and cybersecurity professionals.<br/><br/><br/>This project investigates two major challenges in deploying effective AI-based intrusion detection in edge computing environments: (1) how to enable decentralized, collaborative threat detection via spatial knowledge sharing among edge devices, and (2) how to ensure sustainable IDS performance through temporal knowledge retention.

Smith of Clemson University will investigate a new method for converting agricultural and plastic waste into useful materials through a process called thiocracking, where sulfur and heat are used to break down organic molecules. This research will address challenges in waste disposal, including plastics, agricultural residues, and mixed-material waste, while using excess sulfur, a byproduct of fossil fuel refining. Thiocracking could transform these waste streams into recyclable materials for construction and infrastructure, reducing landfill waste, and benefiting the U.S. economy. The project will also support education by training graduate and undergraduate students, collaborating with primarily undergraduate institutions, and sharing findings with the public through social media and open-access publications where possible.<br/><br/>The project will specifically explore a two-step thiocracking-desulfurization sequence to break down complex waste streams and recover valuable organic products. In the first step, thiocracking will be used to induce depolymerization and conversion into polymeric composites. These composites will then be assessed for mechanical properties and recyclability, with a focus on their potential applications as structural materials. The second step will employ catalytic hydrodesulfurization to remove sulfur and recover hydrocarbons. This process will be optimized for catalyst performance, reaction conditions, and product distribution. Mechanistic studies will provide insight into sulfur-carbon bond formation / cleavage, advancing the fundamental understanding of thiocracking chemistry. If successful, this research would lead to an innovative, energy-efficient, and scalable strategy for repurposing waste plastics and biomass, offering a transformative solution to waste management through chemistry and materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale labeled data, in particular, has been a critical driver of progress in computer vision, the task of making computers see like humans. At the same time, data has also been a major challenge, as many important vision tasks remain starved of high-quality data. This is especially true for 3D vision, which seeks to make computers see 3D shapes from 2D images. To teach computers to see 3D shapes, many images annotated with the 3D shapes are needed, but such annotated images are difficult to obtain in the real world. This project proposes to address the data challenge by using synthetic images, images created by a computer instead of being captured from the real world. In particular, the project proposes to build Infinigen, a free and open-source software program that uses mathematical rules and physics simulation to create realistic-looking 3D scenes  covering a wide range of objects in the real world. Infinigen can create an infinite number of annotated images that look like real images and are useful for training AI systems. Compared to existing sources of synthetic data, Infinigen is unique for a number of reasons. It is not a finite collection of 3D assets or synthetic images; instead, it is a generator that can create infinitely many distinct shapes, textures, materials, and scene compositions. Every asset, from shape to texture, from macro structures to micro details, is entirely procedural, generated from scratch via randomized mathematical rules that allow infinite variation and composition. When completed, Infinigen will offer a broad coverage of objects and scenes in the real world from natural objects to artificial ones, including plants, animals, terrains, cities, indoors, and natural phenomena such as fire, cloud, rain, and snow.<br/><br/>This project is awarded as a planning project. The project team will take initial steps to engage the community and make preparations for developing Infinigen into large-scale community infrastructure. The project team will build upon an existing prototype of Infinigen and make improvements in terms of capabilities and user services. Infinigen is expected to benefit many CISE disciplines including computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and robotics. It can create training data for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and video generation. Work in this project will be integrated with K12, undergraduate, and graduate education through research training, course development and outreach events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a new generation of learning-based super resolution that delivers high image quality, fast performance, and low power consumption. This project will have a transformative impact across a wide range of fields like medical imaging, entertainment, VR, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles. Moreover, by enabling sharper images with fast, energy-efficient processing, this research allows edge devices, such as drones and mobile phones, to perform real-time image enhancement without cloud reliance, saving bandwidth and power. This will drive more efficient processing in constrained environments, reduce costs for high-quality imaging, and unlock new possibilities for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications in smart cities and augmented reality.

But more complicated phenomena (e.g. featuring nonlinearities or spatially-varying media), which are increasingly relevant in applications in medical imaging and also have long-standing intrinsic importance in geophysical exploration, have posed a substantial barrier to this class of methods---which thus have significant untapped potential in these application domains.

By suitably exploiting Green's identity the proposed methods allow for singularity-oblivious quadrature to nevertheless be used for these erstwhile singular integrals; accompanying error analysis in two and three dimensional contexts and in curvilinear domains will place the proposed methods on a firm theoretical foundation, and they will be integrated with fast N-body interaction methods. These methods will be coupled into advanced solvers that enable treatment of complex nonlinearities that arise in acoustic problems found in medical imaging. More generally, the methods will allow the extension of the integral equation methods to nonlinear and possibly time-dependent PDEs, as VIOs reduce inhomogeneous linear PDEs to corresponding homogeneous problems---for which surface integral methods have always been highly advantageous.

These slinky-like folding molecular chains, known as porous foldamers or ?hollow helices?, feature an electrostatically negative, non-collapsible inner void (with a sub-nanometer diameter). These foldamers are expected to function as synthetic enzymes by accelerating chemical transformations by overcoming the energy barriers of targeted reactions within a defined pocket, similar to natural enzymes. The synthetic tunability of the hollow helices offers an adaptable structural platform for the development of enzyme-like catalysts with progressively enhanced efficiency and specificity. Broader impacts include fundamental knowledge, new catalysts, and workforce development through rigorous student training.<br/><br/>The non-deformable inner pores of the aromatic oligoamides are strongly hydrogen-bonding and highly electronegative due to the presence of multiple inwardly oriented amide oxygen atoms.

Inhalation of these particles can cause serious respiratory and cardiovascular health effects.  Using Arizona as a testbed, this research develops and tests a novel, experimental approach that combines satellite remote sensing and health data to better understand the health impacts and hospitalization rates related to dust storms. The project involves atmospheric science, public health, and environmental science. This interdisciplinary approach provides a robust framework for understanding and addressing the adverse health impacts of dust storms, such as asthma, Valley Fever, and cardiovascular disease. This work is important because, over the last few decades, there has been increasing dryness in the U.S. Southwest and persistent droughts elsewhere in the nation. This has resulted in more frequent and intense dust being blown into the atmosphere. This research combines hospitalization records with remote sensing and machine learning to determine dust mineral composition and its link to serious health complications. Knowing which minerals are in the dust and which are most harmful helps health professionals predict and mitigate health risks associated with wind-blown dust. Broader impacts of the work include new method-development, improved correlation and understanding of airborne dust-related health issues, and results that can be used in, or applied to, a variety of environmental health studies. Results of his project can lead to significant advances in our knowledge of how to address dust-related, air quality health issues. The project also aligns with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health and welfare.<br/><br/>Sand and mineral dust storms are significant aeolian processes exacerbated by human activities. Globally, billions of tons of dust are injected into the atmosphere due to farming, desertification, and other human-created and natural environmental processes. These suspended aerosols result in the increased risk of serious health problems. Despite this known link, significant knowledge gaps remain on the actual cause of dust inhalation-related health impacts, particularly with regard to lung sensitivity to dust composition (i.e., mineralogy). This research investigates the health impacts of airborne dust by using machine learning to analyze its mineral composition and correlate it with hospital records on respiratory, cardiovascular, and airborne dust-related infectious diseases. The project uses the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model to simulate air parcel trajectories. It also utilizes advanced, remote sensing, hyperspectral data from the Hyperion, EMIT, CALIPSO, MODIS, and VIIRS satellites. These inputs are then combined with other environmental and hospitalization data using advanced mathematical techniques. Results will identify dust storm sources and develop understandings for use in forecasting health impacts and, when used by public health officials, to help mitigate dust storm impacts. Statistical approaches are employed to analyze the hospitalization patterns derived from Arizona public health databases. Integration of the disparate data allows development of a predictive model for forecasting and mitigating dust storm health impacts as a function of dust and mineral concentration and composition. Research results can be used to develop effective health prevention and/or mitigation strategies that improve dust-related health outcomes in arid and agricultural regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The delivery of the nutrients is enabled by transporters, which are proteins located in the cell membrane.  The study of these proteins is challenging.  Dr. Smith?s research seeks to create novel chemical probes to study a transporter, specifically the large amino acid transporter (LAT1).  The research will also focus on the development of a method for rapid identification of small molecules that are substrates for LAT1.  This project will give students at Bowie State an opportunity to explore protein biochemistry and other modern chemical biology techniques. <br/><br/>The large amino acid transporter (LAT1) is a key nutrient transporter that is highly expressed in the cells in the brain and placenta and in cells with high energy demand in general.  As a transmembrane protein, the structure of LAT1 has been determined only recently and transport by LAT1 was traditionally measured using radioisotope assays. Although computational methods have been used to study LAT1, experimental methods for validation of the computational predictions are lacking. Dr. Smith will pursue the development of proteoliposomes that contain LAT1.  The small molecule binding to LAT1 within the proteoliposomes will be studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  Newly developed fluorescent substrates will be used to screen for molecules that can be transported through LAT1.

In today?s chip manufacturing equipment where precision motion stations exist, there exists a fundamental trade-off between control bandwidth and achievable acceleration due to structural material stiffness-to-weight ratio limits. This trade-off severely limits the throughput of photolithography machines and wafer inspection systems for integrated circuit manufacturing, which directly depend on acceleration and control performance during wafer and photomask positioning stages. This research project attempts to solve this challenge by developing a new mechatronic hardware and control co-design paradigm that overcomes the acceleration-bandwidth trade-off and enables motion systems with substantially improved acceleration without sacrificing control performance, which has the potential to improve productivity in chip manufacturing and thus benefit society at large. Other applications that could benefit from this research include, but are not limited to, laser-based machining and the manufacture of high-power-density electric machines and aerospace structures. Tightly integrated with the research activities, this CAREER project?s education and outreach plans focus on enhancing the authenticity of engineering training, which will foster system-level synergistic thinking through curriculum development, open-source educational content creation, undergraduate research, and outreach efforts. <br/><br/>This research aims to develop theoretical methods and practical tools to transcend an acceleration-bandwidth trade-off in today?s mechatronic systems, thereby tackling key technical barriers toward future chip manufacturing equipment with enhanced throughput. It strives to achieve this goal by creating a new mechatronic hardware and control co-design paradigm that enables systematic utilization of over-actuation and selected compliance. The project will work to (1) stiffen the component?s flexible dynamics through over-actuation, i.e., controlling the structure?s flexible dynamics using distributed actuation and sensing to introduce ?servo-stiffness?, and (2) smartly introduce structural compliance in the actively controlled flexible modes to reduce weight and facilitate controller design. In particular, this project intends to create a structure topology exploration framework to facilitate over-actuation, conduct model-based analysis for over-actuated continuum dynamic systems, develop new robust bandwidth optimal control algorithms, and formulate robust control co-design frameworks for continuum dynamic systems. The effectiveness of the approach will be evaluated through experiments using over-actuated magnetically levitated precision stage prototypes and an in-depth life cycle analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, obtaining high-quality labels in many fields is extremely costly, so most available data remain unlabeled. For example, although millions of images and videos can be easily collected from social media platforms, manually labeling them is a tedious and time-consuming process. To address the challenge of limited labeled data, self-supervised representation learning has emerged as a promising approach in computer vision and natural language processing. It has already played a key role in the success of recent large language models. Despite its strong performance in practice, the theoretical understanding of self-supervised representation learning remains limited. Moreover, the problem of scarce labeled data also affects biomedical research, but the existing self-supervised methods cannot be directly applied due to the unique nature of biomedical datasets. This project aims to address these gaps by developing new theoretical frameworks for self-supervised representation learning, along with computational tools tailored to biomedical studies. It also includes educational efforts to engage students and the broader public with this growing area of research.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance the theoretical foundations of self-supervised representation learning and transform how unlabeled data are utilized in biomedical research. On the theoretical front, the project will investigate self-supervised learning on a low-dimensional nonlinear model, which effectively captures the invariant and intrinsic low-dimensional structure underlying observed data. Building on this nonlinear modeling framework, this project will develop a novel theory that explains the empirical success of self-supervised learning and clarifies the role of pseudo labels generated from unlabeled data. This theoretical foundation will inform the design of innovative and principled learning methodologies. On the application side, the project will integrate self-supervised representation learning into biomedical applications, including microbiome studies and omics-based longitudinal (trajectory) data.

However, scientists still do not have an efficient way to ?plug-and-play? these individual cell-free pieces. This project addresses this gap by developing a modular, standardized platform for cell-free bioprocessing. Instead of custom, one-off designs, the project creates eight reusable modules covering essential functions like energy generation and protein expression. These ?ready-to-use? modules make it easier to mix and match capabilities, allowing for faster, more efficient product development. The team will demonstrate how modular design and standardized kits can reduce costs, improve accessibility, and boost productivity across three market-relevant targets. In doing so, this project aims to make cell-free technologies broadly available and expand the use of cell-free technologies across the U.S. bioeconomy. This project will also cultivate the next generation of biotechnology talent through a dynamic, cross-sector team of postdocs and graduate students?uniting expertise from industry, academia, and government?to pioneer and scale the future of cell-free biomanufacturing.<br/><br/>The project pioneers a modular, standardized framework to address bottlenecks for scaling cell-free bioprocessing. The project will develop, characterize, and integrate eight distinct functional modules common across cell-free systems: three for energy generation, three for the synthesis of valuable products, and two for transcription?translation. These modules span varying levels of complexity?from individual purified enzymes to enzyme cascades, PUrified Recombinant Elements (PURE), and lysate-based systems?encompassing the full spectrum of cell-free biotechnologies. This modularity allows innovation beyond standalone PURE technologies; it comprises modules with defined capabilities, each built and optimized independently, then integrated to achieve more complex and ambitious synthesis goals. The project also incorporates advanced analytical tools and establishes new standards and metrics to rigorously evaluate module performance and compatibility, which will result in a system that provides reliable synthesis. Further, the system will be validated through the synthesis of three industrially relevant targets: the valuable small molecule santalene; the GamS protein, which enhances cell-free protein expression; and production of a bacteriophage. These demonstrations will show how the system can be used for a varied of use cases.

In semiconductor manufacturing, small solid particles, such as dust particles, are a source of contamination. Microchips made from silicon wafers are ruined when a particle lands on its surface during one of the manufacturing steps. Many of these steps involve a plasma to etch or deposit thin films. During these steps, small particles of nanometer or micron size can flake from chamber walls, or grow in the plasma itself, and then fall to the wafer and contaminate it. In this project, a recently invented method of mitigating this contamination is explored to gain an understanding of the physical processes involved towards developing even better mitigation methods. These methods involve applying an electric charge to the particles before they fall on the wafer, and using electric forces to lift and eliminate the particles before they contaminate the wafer. This project includes K12 outreach, course development, and training of both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This collaborative research effort by the University of Iowa and Appalachian State University focuses on the plasma afterglow, which is the condition lasting a few milliseconds after turning off the radio-frequency electrical power that had sustained the plasma. It is during an afterglow that particles can fall to a wafer and contaminate it. An afterglow occurs also during the off-time in modulated-power operation, which is commonly used in manufacturing. During the afterglow, the particle?s electric charge changes rapidly. It was recently discovered that the residual charge can be controlled by applying voltages to electrodes in the plasma chamber during the afterglow, thereby allowing an electric force to lift the particles and reduce the number that fall to the wafer. In this project, understanding of processes in the afterglow will be expanded by performing experiments and simulations. In the experiments, particle charge and movement during modulated plasma operation will be measured by video microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This spectrum is used for many types of wireless communication and must be shared when multiple uses occur in close proximity. The electromagnetic spectrum has become increasingly congested, driven by the needs for wireless communication and sensing to support various applications such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Things. Different wireless systems, such as mobile networks, Wi-Fi, and radar-based sensing devices, must coexist in a limited spectrum band. Although the spectrum at high frequencies promises large bandwidth, it suffers from performance problems such as severe path loss and susceptibility to signal blockages. Thus, managing interference and signal reliability becomes increasingly critical. This project addresses these issues by developing a solution that uses intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to improve spectrum sharing and performance of various wireless systems. IRS is an energy-efficient and programmable surface that can guide radio signals to bypass obstacles and reduce interference. By applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques and considering IRS physics-based constraints, the project aims to increase spectrum utilization and energy efficiency. The outcomes of this research can enhance user connectivity in crowded wireless environments, reduce signal disruptions, and drive application innovations. The project also integrates the wireless and machine-learning research findings into educational programs and provides opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students through related research activities and hands-on system deployment.<br/><br/>This project will develop a multi-IRS-assisted spectrum sharing and sensing framework to enable the coexistence of heterogeneous wireless systems. It explores the following interconnected innovations. (1) A graph neural network (GNN)-based scheme is designed to incorporate environmental information to estimate channel state information (CSI) efficiently and optimize the configurations of IRS reflection elements to direct signals and mitigate interference effectively. (2) A physics-regulated deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control scheme is developed to perform real-time fair resource allocation and beamforming under strict quality-of-service constraints among different wireless systems to optimize resource distribution and ensure reliable signal transmissions.

A scene is composed of various objects arranged in a way that is governed by physical laws. Each object consists of distinct parts that determine its functionality and affordances. For example, in a scene, the laws of gravity mean that chairs will be arranged on the floor and the rules of functionality dictate that the chair will have enough balance through its base or legs to support a person. Because the image is arranged based on the physical laws and functionality, it makes understanding the scene simpler. This project aims to develop a computer vision framework that learns and understands the physical world in a compositional manner, offering two significant benefits. First, a compositional interpretation of objects and scenes enables intelligent systems to engage in richer physical interactions and accomplish more complex tasks. Second, by decomposing complex entities into simpler constituents and modeling their relationships, this compositional approach addresses fundamental challenges faced by purely data-driven methods, including data inefficiency, the curse of dimensionality, and limited explainability. The outcomes of this project will impact a wide range of emerging applications, including robots that support manufacturing or assist with daily tasks, autonomous vehicles that enhance mobility and safety, and virtual or augmented reality interfaces that facilitate assistive workflows and remote collaboration. This project will tightly integrate research and education through curriculum development, research training for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and community outreach.<br/><br/>This project will develop new methodologies for learning and understanding the innate compositionality of objects and scenes in the physical world. It consists of three innovative thrusts. Thrust I aims to establish a unified framework for representing, parsing, and learning the compositionality of physical objects, through disentangled modeling of large shape variations, constituent parts, and detailed deformations of each part as multi-granularity neural fields. Thrust II aims to develop a new compositional model that parses 3D dynamic scenes from streaming video into an explainable layout graph on the fly, by constructing distributed representations of low-level geometry and motion and performing explicit reasoning about high-level scene compositionality. Thrust III will extend the first two thrusts by modeling the compositionality of generic articulated objects and investigating test-time adaptation for 3D dynamic scene parsing. Distinct from purely data-driven methods, this new compositional paradigm reduces reliance on extensive 3D annotations, naturally handles the high dimensionality of geometry and motion, and enables a deeper, more explainable understanding of the physical world. This project will advance and enrich fundamental research in visual compositionality, physical object and scene understanding, and explainable parsing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These interfaces are crucial in biological processes such as tissue development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. The project aims to understand how cells from different tissues interact and organize themselves when they come into contact. This research is significant because it attempts to addresses fundamental questions about cell behavior and organization, which are essential for advancing our knowledge of biology and medicine. This work supports the progress of science and advances national health by providing a deeper understanding of the physical and biological mechanisms that drive cell interactions. By understanding these interactions, the project could lead to new ways to control tissue repair and healing, prevent cancer spread, and design engineered tissues. The work will also involve transformation of an online resource, the Cell Migration Seminars Series, into an open tool for learning.<br/><br/>Confluent collectives of epithelial cells line every organ surface and body cavity. While the homeostatic epithelial collective remains solid-like and sedentary, previously stationary epithelial collectives mobilize and undergo large-scale, coordinated motion during development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. This collective fluidization necessarily leads to the creation and maintenance of interfaces between tissues with distinct physical and biological identities. However, the biological and physical rules governing the spatial and temporal evolution of these active interfaces are largely unknown. While the role of gene expression patterns and specific signaling pathways has provided significant understanding of the formation, sharpening, and maintenance of tissue boundaries during developmental processes, significantly less is understood about rules governing the interactions of different cell types as might occur after injury or during cancer metastasis. Both biological and physical mechanisms have been suggested to govern boundary dynamics after collisions of distinct cell types, but understanding remains limited. Here, the fundamental mechanobiology of heterotypic tissue interface dynamics will be investigated through variation of physical and biological properties of the constituent cellular collectives. Preliminary data indicates that collective behaviors following collisions are complex, emergent, and unexpected. Antagonistic migration assays will be used to create a reproducible tissue interface between any two cell types. The resultant tissue interface dynamics will be determined, and underlying cell-substrate tractions and cell-cell stresses governing the emergent behaviors at the interface will be measured. These studies intend to advance predictive understanding of collective cellular behaviors towards the ability to design a cellular interface with programmable morphodynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These detailed, multi-platform studies will be the first to fully exploit existing data sets to address fundamental problems that are vital for achieving NSF?s strategic goals. Such events may affect technological systems, astronauts and spacecraft, electrical power grids, and other important technologies that modern society has come to depend on.

Specifically, we will determine how the response, typically an electromagnetic wave pulse, propagates through the magnetosphere (radially, azimuthally, or a combination thereof); what wave mode and Poynting flux are associated with this response; and how the wave mode evolves.

Moreover, these complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, geometry, and topology--all of which are core areas of mathematics.

Deuterium is a naturally occurring stable isotope of hydrogen, the incorporation of which into polymers has the potential to create a revolutionary class of plastic optics with vastly improved transparency across the visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) spectrum. Currently, there remains a critical need in US defense and consumer sectors (automotive and construction) for low cost, optical glass materials that are transparent across the VIS-IR spectrum. State-of-the-art systems solely rely on heavy, expensive inorganic materials and would tremendously benefit from the creation of an alternative, low cost, light-weight plastic optical material. Hence, the UA team will explore new deuteration chemistry to prepare novel molecules and polymeric materials with the highly desirable combination of high transparency across the VIS-IR spectrum, lightweight, and robust mechanical properties over a range of temperatures. The broader impacts of the project are significant as the technological impacts of this work are far reaching, benefiting US defense systems reliant on IR optical systems, along with the pharmaceutical and nuclear energy sectors that are already heavily invested in new deuteration chemistry. Furthermore, the project will create new opportunities to engage large cohorts of undergraduate students (20-30 per semester) with research experiences in the chemical and polymer sciences via a multi-tiered training model to maximize on effective workforce training for next-generation scientists and engineers.<br/>	<br/>To address the technical challenges of this project, Pyun and Njardarson will develop new synthetic chemistry and polymerization processes to replace all the hydrogen atoms in selected optical plastic materials with atoms of the stable isotope form of hydrogen, known as deuterium. This will require the creation of new synthetic chemistry using alternative deuterated starting materials to prepare these wholly deuterated molecules and perdeuterated polymers using cost-efficient, scalable methods suitable for industrial translation. Earlier work in this area has only been successful with a very narrow subset of molecules and polymers, all of which use prohibitively expensive materials and methods. Hence, the project will focus on developing this new fundamental chemistry which will have profound effects on the optical transparency of the resulting polymeric materials and afford a new class of VIS-IR broadband plastic optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of realizing smart cities, smart agriculture, and smart healthcare is jeopardized due to the bottlenecks facing traditional electronic platforms at the heart of these emerging applications. Silicon photonics represents an innovative paradigm that can overcome these bottlenecks, by supporting light-speed and high throughput communication and computation. However, the design of silicon photonics based smart computing platforms is still in its infancy, with many open challenges. One of the most significant of these challenges is to design integrated electro-photonic platforms that are truly sustainable while also simultaneously minimizing manufacturing costs, energy footprint, and fault susceptibility. This project will take the first steps towards realizing efficient electro-photonic computing platforms that far surpass traditional electronic platforms in terms of performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability. In doing so, this project will help establish a new ecosystem of development of emerging digital intelligence platforms, for multiple application use cases that span datacenters, scientific computing, and edge systems, where photonics is making inroads. This outcome will help reduce costs and overheads of designing future smart computing platforms, which will benefit technological innovation across U.S. consumer, industrial, and defense sectors. This will also help the U.S. outcompete global competitors to emerge as the pioneer in innovative computing design for such emerging technologies. By exposing students to diverse aspects of electro-photonic circuit design, yield analysis, lifetime evaluation, modeling and trade-offs, and computing architecture design, the proposed research will contribute towards educating an agile high-tech workforce that will maintain continued U.S. leadership in technological innovation, especially in emerging post-Moore technologies. <br/><br/>This project will employ the principles of heterogeneity, reconfigurability, and recycling to transform performance, functional flexibility, and resource utilization of integrated electro-photonic platforms. The overarching goal will be to extend operational lifespan and co-reduce the embodied and use-phase costs of emerging heterogeneous integrated electro-photonic-based 2.5D computing platforms. To that end, this project will make three synergistic contributions: 1) Analyze variations and aging-aware footprints, by developing the first modeling framework for integrated electro-photonic platforms, quantifying sustainability costs of enabling variation resilience, and characterizing impacts of aging in these platforms, 2) Prolong carbon-minimum lifespan and co-optimize embodied and operational metrics, by developing techniques to prolong integrated electro-photonic platform lifespan with design time and runtime adaptive techniques, devising cross-layer techniques to reduce operational overheads, managing failure risk with runtime mechanisms for graceful degradation, and co-reducing use-phase and embodied sustainability metric costs, and 3) Introduce reuse and hardware polymorphism to reduce costs for multifunctional computing, communication, and storage components in integrated electro-photonic platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lattice based cryptography is a foundation for advanced cryptographic schemes that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Secure cryptography is essential for digital communication, for example for ensuring the safe transfer of sensitive financial data. The new mathematical advance behind this project is the efficient construction of lattices that have both addition and multiplication operations and that are more densely packed than the ones now typically used in cryptography. The central goals of the project are to improve these constructions, to develop faster algorithms to operate on these lattices, and to build more efficient cryptographic applications using them.<br/><br/>The technical advances in this project concern number fields with small root discriminants. This project will study the computational complexity of constructing such number fields and of performing arithmetic operations in them. Prior work on infinite families of number fields with small root discriminants has focused on existence theorems. This project will build on work of two of the P.I.s on efficient explicit constructions of such families. The goal is to improve these constructions using a variety of mathematical techniques including Galois cohomology, explicit Chebotarev theorems and recent advances on Hilbert's 12th problem via p-adic methods and modular forms. Another goal is to develop fast Fourier methods for performing arithmetic operations of the kind needed in cryptography. The relevance of number fields with small root discriminants was noted by Peikert and Rosen in 2006. They showed that such fields lead to very small connection factors relating the difficulty of solving the worst case of the short vector problem to the difficulty of solving the average case of the short integer solution problem.

Forest fires cause severe damage to communities by destroying property and livelihoods. To mitigate wildfire risk and severity, several clearing methods are utilized, ranging from mechanical fuel reduction, to prescribed burning and to grazing by animals. For mechanical reduction, limbing - the removal of lower branches from trees ? is one of the most critical methods for preventing crown fires, as these lower limbs act as ""ladders"" that help surface fires reach the canopy. However, limbing remains largely reliant on manual, hazardous and labor-intensive activities performed by forestry workers. This project look to provide needed knowledge for the development of robotic teams capable of autonomously cutting and catching lower tree limbs. The new robotic system looks to alleviate the workload of forestry workers in some of their most physically demanding activities, improving occupational health. It also intends to accelerate removal of hazardous fuels from the forest, contributing to wildfire prevention in the US. Results from this research intend to help protect US communities located near or within forests, as well as forest-based industries such as logging and tourism.

At the higher level, a centralized spiral-based planner looks to compute optimal trajectories for the cutter and catcher robots, considering tree geometry, kinematic and actuation constraints, and maximizing branch collection.

During the last two decades, PFAS have been increasingly detected in surface water systems (lakes and rivers) and  groundwater aquifers which serve as sources of drinking water for many communities throughout the United States. In addition, many PFAS can be transformed through abiotic and biotic pathways in natural and engineered water systems to produce toxic perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). There is a critical need for new data and knowledge to advance the fundamental understanding of the fate, transport, and reactivity of PFAS in drinking water systems. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to investigate and evaluate the abiotic and biotic transformations of PFAS in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) as the treated water transits through the distribution systems to customers? taps. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to integrate field studies of PFAS transformations in selected DWDS with controlled laboratory and pilot scale experiments. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge to advance the design of engineering solutions and policy recommendations to address and mitigate PFAS drinking water contamination. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students at George Mason University. <br/><br/>Many drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) exhibit environmental conditions comparable to those of natural aquatic systems in which the transformations of PFAS compounds and precursors to toxic perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), have been observed. In addition, the components of DWDS (e.g., pipes, tanks, and water towers) can serve as substrates for the accumulation of scales/sediments and the formation of biofilms that cause/catalyze the abiotic/biotic transformations of dissolved contaminants in these systems. This CAREER project will test the hypothesis that PFAS transformations in DWDS are primarily mediated by the biotic transformations of PFAS compounds and precursors that accumulate in their scales and sediment biofilms. To test this hypothesis, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to evaluate and characterize the chemical and microbial processes controlling PFAS transformations in DWDS with a focus on storage facilities in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) investigate PFAS partitioning and transformations in drinking water storage facilities and develop methods and infrastructure for the design of  controlled experiments to generate fundamental insights; 2) evaluate the effects of storage tank/sediment materials and environmental parameters on PFAS partitioning and transformations in drinking water storage facilities; and 3) evaluate the effect of treatment residuals on PFAS transformations in the biofilms of drinking water storage facilities. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the design and implementation of engineering solutions to minimize and mitigate PFAS contamination in drinking water storage facilities and distribution systems. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the PI proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at George Mason University (GMU) to carry out curricular research on chemistry education to support learning and success for community college transfer, non-traditional and traditional students in environmental engineering (EE). More specifically, the PI proposes to 1) investigate the impact of student chemistry preparation, attitudes, and demographics on performance and interest in EE); 2) evaluate correlations between student performance in chemistry and mastery of concepts in introductory EE courses; and 3) use the knowledge gained from this research to design lessons to remediate student chemistry preparation gaps and prepare students for the successful completion of EE undergraduate education at GMU.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modeling computation is an important building block for this understanding, however, students often struggle with abstract modeling and visualization. A prior Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project resulted in a prototype tool which provides immediate feedback on the computational models designed by students. This Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project aims to add features to the tool, improve its usability and adaptability, and investigate its impact on student problem-solving at a larger scale, in different educational settings.<br/><br/>The existing Automated Feedback for Computing Theory (AFCT) prototype tool was built on the widely used Java Formal Languages and Automata Package (JFLAP) visualization tool that aids students in learning the basic concepts of formal languages and automata theory. The enhanced tool developed in this project will initially be deployed and outcomes assessed in theoretical computer science courses at the five collaborating institutions. It will be made available under an opensource license to enable others to use and modify the software to suit their needs. The research questions are focused on understanding the impacts of the tool on students' behavior, performance, and learning of computing theory; whether students from different types of institutions are impacted in significantly different ways; and the effects of various types of feedback on students' learning. The tool's added functionality, improved usability, and availability as opensource software will encourage its adoption at other institutions and increase its educational benefits.

Unreinforced masonry structures, prevalent in rural town centers and inner-city neighborhoods, play an important role in preserving cultural identity and contributing to social and economic resilience; however, their vulnerability to tornadoes is not well understood or modeled. Through integrating engineering, social science, and preservation perspectives, this research aims to advance the science behind vulnerability and recovery models for unreinforced masonry buildings. The project intends to enhance community resilience, preserve cultural heritage, and support sustainable development in historically underserved areas. A key component of this project is its educational program, which will cultivate a new generation of professionals equipped with interdisciplinary skills to address disaster resilience and recovery challenges in communities dense with older, unreinforced masonry structures. The educational program will include new undergraduate and graduate coursework, hands-on research opportunities for students, workforce development programs, and community co-learning experiences. By bridging the gap between academic research and practical application, these educational activities will prepare students, professionals, and community members to tackle real-world challenges in disaster preparedness and recovery. This award will contribute to NSF's role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). <br/><br/>This research intends to develop a framework for understanding and modeling the complex dynamics of older unreinforced masonry buildings during tornado events and recovery. By identifying and operationalizing key structural, social, and preservation features to create more accurate predictive models for damage and recovery, this project intends to advance both pre-disaster mitigation strategies and post-disaster recovery efforts. The research methodology will include (1) collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data from tornado-affected communities using remote sensing techniques, in-situ surveys, and socio-economic assessments; (2) performing feature importance analysis through machine learning algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosting; and (3) developing updated fragility curves using Bayesian statistical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. The project outcomes will include refined damage and recovery models for unreinforced masonry structures, practitioner guides, and community tip sheets, thus translating research findings into actionable resources for disaster preparedness and recovery planning. This approach intends to provide communities, policymakers, and practitioners with valuable tools to enhance the recovery and resilience of unreinforced masonry structures in tornado-prone areas.

This project advances what is known about attitude formation and attitude changes, by examining how geographic contexts shape the formation of attitudes and influence the quality of interpersonal interactions.<br/><br/>This project tests three questions derived from an interdisciplinary mathematical model of attitude formation. This model draws inspiration from social psychology and urban science to explicitly account for interactions at different spatial scales. Specifically, the project tests: (1) How much do attitudes vary across place and spatial scale? (2) How much can the nested contexts of cities and neighborhoods explain about attitude formation? (3) How much variation in attitudes across spatial scales and places is related to the quality of local interpersonal interactions? To support training for students and researchers, the project also includes the development of an online course and a set of example data analysis pipelines demonstrating the application of these methods.

When a rough surface is exposed to the flow, it is assumed that the only effect of the roughness is to increase the friction without otherwise changing details about the flow. However, this assumption is unproven in all but the simplest situations. The purpose of this project is to definitively resolve this issue, using the novel approach of comparing flows over different surfaces that generate the same friction. This work will enable more reliable analysis and design of many systems and vehicles. The project will engage and train researchers at postdoctoral, doctorate, undergraduate, and high-school levels, enable interdisciplinary international exchanges, and provide unique research experiences for hundreds of undergraduate engineers.<br/><br/>The approach will combine state-of-the-art experimental capabilities and experience at Virginia Tech with leading edge computational expertise at the University of Cambridge. The goal is to reveal the limits and mechanisms of rough wall similarity, by comparing the properties and mechanics of non-equilibrium boundary layers generated over rough walls with different geometry but with the same effective sand-grain roughness. This comparison will be conducted for a systematic set of two- and three-dimensional flow geometries that include many of the non-equilibrium complexities found in practical applications. At Virginia Tech, experiments performed in the Stability Tunnel will include detailed mean flow and turbulence measurements at friction Reynolds numbers up to 20,000. Coordinated and complementary scale-resolving simulations at Cambridge will provide intricately detailed views of the turbulence dynamics that mediate the critical relationship between the roughness layer and outer region.

The present project addresses this need by developing and commercializing a highly sensitive, cost-effective, portable, user-friendly sensor system for the detection of bacterial disease, with the goal of enabling rapid, easy testing for the presence of the disease in all environments, including low-resource settings.  The new system, which combines advanced quantum-dot sensor technology with a proven rapid detection assay and a specialized user-friendly reader technology, will be developed using tuberculosis, a bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that can be lethal if not detected early, as a test case.  In recent years, the prevalence of the disease has increased within the U.S. and worldwide, and significant resources are being invested to help physicians combat tuberculosis; thus, there is an urgent need to develop and make available a highly sensitive sensor system that frontline healthcare professionals can use to diagnose tuberculosis readily and reliably. The long-term goal of this project is to enhance public health by reducing the spread of tuberculosis.  In addition to developing and commercializing a superior sensor system to fill a market gap in tuberculosis diagnosis, the project includes activities aimed at developing a skilled workforce to tackle regional and national disease challenges that pose a threat to societal health and U.S. economic strength.<br/><br/>The QueueD Insights team, which consists of two industry partners (InBios and C2Sense) and several academic institutions (University of Nevada Reno, University of Illinois Chicago, University of Wisconsin?Milwaukee, and Duke University), will develop and commercialize a sensor system that meets internationally accepted standards for sensitivity, cost, speed, and ease of use in healthcare contexts for the early detection of tuberculosis.  The sensor of the system involves a lateral flow assay that detects Lipoarabinomanna fragments of M. tuberculosis found in the urine of tuberculosis patients, which makes it suitable for diagnosing both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. By combining the Advanced Quantum-Dots technology patented by QueueD Insights with the lateral flow assay and a custom-built time-resolved luminescence reader, the sensor system adopts three technologies critical to markedly increasing assay sensitivity: preconcentration of scarce antigens, a high-affinity antibody for antigen capture, and a background-free, time-resolved fluorescence detection system. The resulting sensor system will enable significantly enhanced tuberculosis detection.  The system?s validity will be established through preclinical studies. Strategies for scaling up the system?s manufacturing and distribution in the tuberculosis diagnosis market will be established with assistance of current and future national and international partners.  The goal of this effort is to achieve widespread adoption of the novel sensor system to increase tuberculosis testing rates and detection world-wide, and, ultimately, improve U.S. public health.

The rise of two-dimensional materials has ushered in a new era in condensed matter physics, which at the same time has raised several novel questions regarding the microscopic atomic details of the atoms as the layers are twisted and stacked on top of each other. <br/><br/>This research aids in the general understanding of these materials by: i) Theoretically investigating the effects of twist-angle disorder in twisted bilayers of graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides, as well as using vacancies and their scanning-tunneling microscopy response as a probe of twisted bilayer graphene; ii) Determining what kinds of symmetry-broken and strongly correlated states can emerge on the quasiperiodic structures that form from the relaxational process in twisted bilayer graphene close to aligned with hexagonal boron nitride; iii) Understanding how to manipulate the topological Weyl Fermi-arc surface states by coupling them with classical spin ice, quantum spin ice, or a super lattice potential.<br/><br/>The PI will employ several computational approaches that combine the kernel polynomial method with the model building capabilities of Wannierization, and many-body approaches that include Hartree-Fock and the dynamical mean-field theory, to describe a wide range of two-dimensional materials that lack translational symmetry. The ultimate goals of this research are first to understand how realistic effects that are innate in these systems affect their behavior, second to use these properties to our advantage to measure physical aspects of the device that have been hitherto out of reach, and lastly to discover novel phases of quantum matter that result when we these systems become strongly interacting.<br/><br/>The educational efforts of this proposal focus on career development inside and outside of academia that fosters multifaceted learning and career opportunities for PhD students through direct interactions and exposure with industry professionals and alumni.

In addition to geometry on the xy-plane, mathematicians today study geometry on surfaces such as the crust of the Earth or the glaze of a donut. Most of these surfaces exhibit hyperbolic geometry, a type of non-Euclidean geometry in which parallel lines spread apart. Because of its ubiquity, two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry is a common meeting point for many branches of mathematics. Recently, the PI strengthened a connection linking hyperbolic geometry with certain transformations of two-dimensional Euclidean geometries, which were motivated by the kinetic motion of particles and the flow of electrons. The goal of this project is to further investigate this connection between non-Euclidean and Euclidean geometries in order to better understand both worlds. The project will also support professionalization, mentorship, and enrichment activities for a broad range of students.<br/><br/>The research component of this project has three main prongs of attack. The first is to further develop (and complicate) the link between the earthquake and horocycle flows, dynamical systems on moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces and quadratic differentials, respectively. This will allow the PI both to leverage decades of progress on quadratic differentials to study hyperbolic surfaces, and to leverage new geometric features afforded by hyperbolic space to study quadratic differentials. The second prong is to study the structure of optimal Lipschitz maps between hyperbolic surfaces and their related renormalization dynamics. The final prong is to use all of these tools to investigate related counting problems on both flat and hyperbolic surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations studied are completely integrable systems, for which there are many more analytical techniques available than for more general equations.  However, at the same time integrable equations are known to arise from more general equations in certain limiting cases.  Each time that a new result is established for a completely integrable model that arises in this way, a version of that result immediately applies to all of the more general models.  These properties make the study of integrable models both mathematically compelling and also of prime physical relevance.

Long-time asymptotics for the Benjamin-Ono equation are being established, and soliton gases are being constructed for this equation.  A nonlocal model of nonlinear Schroedinger type is being studied.  Pivoting to more classical nonlinear Schroedinger equations and their relatives, dynamical stability of slowly-decaying rogue waves on the zero background (""rogue waves of infinite order"") is being analyzed, uniformity of asymptotic behavior of such solutions in the large is being determined, a mechanism for generating such waves from extreme self-focusing is being explored in several models, a family of solutions continuously interpolating between rogue waves and solitons is being analyzed, and a universality result is being proved for the first time in the setting of the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation.  The project also addresses open questions in the theory of Painleve equations, establishing an isomonodromic representation for general special-function solutions and studying asymptotic limits in the parameter space for which in some cases there are outstanding conjectures in the literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To elaborate, algebraic geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations.  Hodge theory seeks to understand the shape of the algebraic spaces defined by their solution sets.  In so doing, it produces powerful connections between algebraic geometry and other parts of mathematics and physics, such as number theory, differential equations, and string theory.  Normal functions are solutions to differential equations arising from algebraic cycles (or subspaces) on an algebraic space.  By recognizing a solution as a normal function, which is a nontrivial task, one gets access to its behavior at numerous ""special"" points.  In the scenarios to be considered in this project, these ""special values"" have important applications to identities and conjectures in number theory, the classification of algebraic spaces such as Fano varieties and algebraic curves, and the spectra of operators in topological string theory.  This project will also help to train the next generation of researchers in pure mathematics, by integrating the PI's graduate students in work on specific problems in Hodge theory and bringing outside consultants to Washington University.  Results will be disseminated through conferences, summer schools, journal articles, and websites.<br/><br/>Normal functions originated in the work of Poincare and Lefschetz in the early 20th century.  They are to families of algebraic cycles what period maps are to families of algebraic varieties:  the basic Hodge-theoretic invariant.  Informally, they are given by integrals of differential forms on non-closed chains instead of topological cycles, and satisfy inhomogeneous differential equations instead of homogeneous ones.  The PI will study the properties, invariants, classification, and geometric realization of normal functions.  The settings and applications range from arithmetic geometry and number theory to mirror symmetry, moduli, and mathematical physics.  The specific goals of this project are to:  (I) produce new evidence for the Beilinson and Bloch-Kato conjectures on special values of L-functions, and provide motivic realizations of biextensions; (II) describe an A-model variation of mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of a Fano variety, and a B-model Lefschetz principle governing normal functions on LG-models; and (III) classify and realize normal functions with values in Hermitian and hypergeometric variations of Hodge structure, with applications to moduli of curves, hypergeometric identities, and quantization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social connections help mitigate the stressors young people face. Technologies that build community engagement and include information of public and local interest, that is, civic technologies, have shown promise for improving social connections. Yet existing tools often fail to sustain public interest or help the public intuitively navigate the complex data displayed, and also often lack transparency. Little is known about how civic technologies can be designed to engage young people, whose ideas about what community means and how it is best formed, often differ from the adult-centered views driving existing tools. Addressing these research gaps, the project team is creating and evaluating a toolkit that will include a novel suite of data and technology to support youth-led civic engagement, build a more socially cohesive community, and in turn support youth mental health and the wellbeing of people in the local community. Through collaborations with community and municipal organizations, this work is improving civic data access for youth and their communities, enabling community-grounded data interactions that advance social cohesion and wellbeing, and helping build data literacy, an essential 21st century skill. <br/><br/>This research is engaging youth in the co-design of a toolkit and activities for building data literacy, software tools for community data collection, visualization, and storytelling, and templates to represent data in physical forms that enable learning, communication, problem solving, and decision making. Mixed-method studies are evaluating how using these community tools can support key dimensions of data work (e.g., collecting, analyzing, and representing neighborhood wellbeing data), youth dialogue around data insights with their communities, data transparency, civic engagement that catalyzes neighborhood cohesion and, ultimately, young people's resilience to stressors. While smart city innovation has accelerated, it rarely centers on the creative vision and agency of youth. Addressing that gap, this work is creating and testing a novel community data platform that helps youth achieve their aspirations for improved wellbeing in their neighborhoods. This empirical research is yielding previously unavailable evidence regarding patterns of adoption and engagement with civic technologies amongst youth, and how such tools can be designed to support youth-led, community-grounded, and data-driven interactions that strengthen neighborhoods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Digital twins, or virtual replicas, integrate real-time data with computational models to provide essential insights into the operations, structural health, and longevity of these assets. The research supported by this award specifically aims to develop digital twin frameworks tailored to overcome the challenges posed by unpredictable environmental forces like wind, waves, and currents. These dynamic forces, often unmeasured, significantly influence the safety and durability of floating structures. This research seeks to pioneer methods to accurately predict these uncertain forces, enhancing the reliability and predictive accuracy of digital twins. This capability is key for ensuring occupant safety in floating homes, extending the operational life of energy infrastructures, and assessing the integrity of floating transportation systems under extreme weather conditions. Beyond its scientific and practical impacts, this award will support workforce development, enhancing engineering education in STEM fields. A comprehensive outreach strategy is planned to engage participants across various educational levels, including K- 12 students, schoolteachers, undergraduate, and graduate students, with the goals of developing a competitive STEM workforce and enhancing the engagement with science and technology in the United States.<br/><br/>This research introduces a novel stochastic system identification framework, Bayesian Load-Agnostic Continuous Estimation for Digital Twinning (B-LACE4DT). This framework is designed to address the critical challenge of managing unknown and uncertain loads and forces such as wind, waves, and currents, which significantly impact floating structures. Unlike conventional methods that depend on measurable external loads or assume stationary known statistics, B-LACE4DT utilizes innovative filtering and smoothing algorithms for output-only state and parameter estimation, thus eliminating the dependency on direct input measurements. The approach enables precise, real-time structural diagnosis and prognosis while effectively incorporating the inherent uncertainties of complex dynamic systems. The research targets three types of floating structures, each selected for their unique technical challenges. For the first structure, the framework will improve assessments of fatigue damage and monitor the health of mooring lines by estimating dynamic responses under uncertain hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads. For the second, the methodology will enhance finite element model updating and virtual sensing, which will advance damage detection and performance evaluation under variable and stochastic load conditions. In the third case, B-LACE4DT will enable precise tracking of displacements, improving safety and comfort for occupants by effectively managing large-amplitude motions induced by marine dynamics. The methodology integrates physics-based models with real-time data assimilation, employing recursive Bayesian estimation techniques, and includes the development of novel derivative-free nonlinear smoothing algorithms. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust framework for the digital twinning of floating structures.  To validate this framework, the project will integrate experimental and operational data, including laboratory wave tank tests of scaled prototypes and field measurements from operational infrastructures. Collaboration with industry partners will further enhance the validation process. Through rigorous testing and validation, B-LACE4DT aims to significantly advance the reliability and predictive capabilities of digital twins for large-scale floating structures, thereby setting new standards in structural health monitoring, remaining useful life estimation, and decision-making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Dynamics, Control and Systems Diagnostics (DCSD) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of realizing smart cities, smart agriculture, and smart healthcare is jeopardized due to the bottlenecks facing traditional electronic platforms at the heart of these emerging applications. Silicon photonics represents an innovative paradigm that can overcome these bottlenecks, by supporting light-speed and high throughput communication and computation. However, the design of silicon photonics based smart computing platforms is still in its infancy, with many open challenges. One of the most significant of these challenges is to design integrated electro-photonic platforms that are truly sustainable while also simultaneously minimizing manufacturing costs, energy footprint, and fault susceptibility. This project will take the first steps towards realizing efficient electro-photonic computing platforms that far surpass traditional electronic platforms in terms of performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability. In doing so, this project will help establish a new ecosystem of development of emerging digital intelligence platforms, for multiple application use cases that span datacenters, scientific computing, and edge systems, where photonics is making inroads. This outcome will help reduce costs and overheads of designing future smart computing platforms, which will benefit technological innovation across U.S. consumer, industrial, and defense sectors. This will also help the U.S. outcompete global competitors to emerge as the pioneer in innovative computing design for such emerging technologies. By exposing students to diverse aspects of electro-photonic circuit design, yield analysis, lifetime evaluation, modeling and trade-offs, and computing architecture design, the proposed research will contribute towards educating an agile high-tech workforce that will maintain continued U.S. leadership in technological innovation, especially in emerging post-Moore technologies. <br/><br/>This project will employ the principles of heterogeneity, reconfigurability, and recycling to transform performance, functional flexibility, and resource utilization of integrated electro-photonic platforms. The overarching goal will be to extend operational lifespan and co-reduce the embodied and use-phase costs of emerging heterogeneous integrated electro-photonic-based 2.5D computing platforms. To that end, this project will make three synergistic contributions: 1) Analyze variations and aging-aware footprints, by developing the first modeling framework for integrated electro-photonic platforms, quantifying sustainability costs of enabling variation resilience, and characterizing impacts of aging in these platforms, 2) Prolong carbon-minimum lifespan and co-optimize embodied and operational metrics, by developing techniques to prolong integrated electro-photonic platform lifespan with design time and runtime adaptive techniques, devising cross-layer techniques to reduce operational overheads, managing failure risk with runtime mechanisms for graceful degradation, and co-reducing use-phase and embodied sustainability metric costs, and 3) Introduce reuse and hardware polymorphism to reduce costs for multifunctional computing, communication, and storage components in integrated electro-photonic platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Miniaturizing these systems to a chip-scale will allow for optical techniques in several fields that impact society, such as biomedical devices, quantum computers, and portable displays, to be scalable, portable, low-cost, and mass manufacturable enabling widespread dissemination. However, in contrast to traditional infrared telecommunication applications where PICs already play an important role, visible applications require optical wavefront shaping capabilities. Current wavefront shaping techniques rely on table-top optics or chips with large waveguide systems, which grow in terms of footprint, optical loss, density of optical routing challenges, and electrical control power. This project addresses these challenges by developing single waveguides capable of creating miniaturized 3D optical patterns using nanoscale wavefront shaping. The project includes educational activities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students that will contribute to building the workforce in semiconductors and chip-scale technologies. Visible PICs are visually captivating and important for many societally-relevant applications (e.g. neurotechnology), making them an ideal platform to demonstrate the power of chip-scale technologies to students. The plans also include an annual immersive early-exposure science day for middle school students (Nano Day) as well as an interactive, hands-on lesson that will be delivered to local public schools through the STEM Ambassadors program. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The proposed research develops a platform to enable scalable, nanoscale wavefront shaping using multimode PICs through amplitude and phase control of transverse spatial optical modes.

The work proposed here will lead to ultra-compact fully integrated chip-scale beam steering devices capable of producing grating-lobe-free complex beam structuring over a wider field of view than previous methods. In turn, these structures for manipulating optical modes will also allow new system architectures in PICs that leverage the spatial degree-of-freedom beyond a few higher order modes to make a leap towards very-large-scale integration like their electronic counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past decade, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole has made key discoveries by detecting high-energy neutrinos and identifying two active galaxies as neutrino sources. However, sub-TeV neutrinos (10?1000 GeV) remain a largely unexplored frontier with the potential to significantly expand our observation of the universe. This project leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to overcome computational challenges and improve the reconstruction of sub-TeV neutrinos using IceCube?s DeepCore subdetector. These advancements will enable detailed studies of astrophysical sources such as NGC 1068 at lower energy scales and pave the way for real-time public alerts of sub-TeV neutrinos, fostering coordinated follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition to advancing neutrino astrophysics, the AI methodologies developed here will benefit a wide range of fields with similar challenges, including weather forecasting, neuroscience, smart cities, and precision farming, by enhancing the analysis of distributed sensor data. By integrating education initiatives, outreach programs, and undergraduate participation, this project promotes access to advanced research, supports STEM, and inspires the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This project addresses the computational barriers to sub-TeV neutrino reconstruction through four interconnected research tasks. First, it designs a novel AI architecture capable of managing spatial and temporal irregularities in IceCube?s sensor data while embedding physics invariance for improved accuracy. Second, the project enhances computational efficiency by leveraging physics-informed inductive biases, enabling real-time processing of millions of neutrino events with low latency. Third, robust training methodologies will be implemented to address systematic uncertainties. Finally, the project investigates approximate symmetry modeling to allow AI models to adapt to practical deviations from the ideal physical model without compromising performance. These innovations will significantly improve the angular resolution and sensitivity of DeepCore to sub-TeV neutrinos, paving the way for transformative discoveries about astrophysical sources such as Seyfert galaxies as well as objects in the Milky Way.

Past studies suggest that factors such as familial ties to an area, history in a community, age, employment opportunities, insurance coverage, and risk perceptions shape these residential decisions. Most of these studies, however, have focused on homeowners exclusively, ignoring renters, which make up 34 percent of U.S. households. Renters also encounter unique challenges in deciding where to live after disasters, since they do not decide whether to rebuild rental units after disasters. Understanding how renters make residential decisions after disasters, however, is paramount to ensuring communities recover after disasters. A wide range of businesses essential to community functioning rely heavily on renters, including restaurants, construction, farming, vegetation management, landscaping, and catering. This study addresses how renters make residential decisions after wildfires in two communities recently affected by major wildfires. Study findings support the development of disaster recovery plans that support the recovery of the housing market, the local economy, and renters after disasters. <br/><br/>This project investigates how renters? make residential decisions after wildfires using a modified Push-Pull Model of Migration. Previous literature, primarily focused on floods, suggests that residential decisions after disasters are shaped by several factors, including functional and emotional place attachments, hazard experiences, and risk perceptions. These factors can push individuals out of communities, pull them into others, or anchor them in place after disasters. This study uses photovoice interviews to examine how place attachment and risk perception shape the residential decisions of renters displaced by wildfires and compare how residential adjustment pathways vary between renters and homeowners. Study findings advance theory by applying a modified version of the Push Pull Model, accounting for the role of anchoring effects in residential adjustment decisions of renters and examining interdependencies between place attachments and risk perceptions among renters. Likewise, the study sheds light on the factors that shape renters? residential adjustment decisions, supporting the development of recovery programs that account for the unique needs of renters. Study findings are relevant to other hazards as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Higher frequencies provide higher capacity but also have a much shorter distance range for coverage compared to lower-frequency signals. This means that a single access point (AP) or a base station cannot cover a large area leading to smaller areas (cells) with each AP handling a smaller number of users. This dense deployment of  small-cell APs necessitates a heightened level of intelligence and timely situational awareness to enhance network resilience and self-reconfigurability in the face of various challenges like network or AP failures. To tackle these challenges, this project pursues a novel resilience-native network paradigm called CatFly,  which embraces a data-driven learning approach that utilizes a digital replica of the physical network with sufficient details to swiftly achieve preemptive operations against disruptions. Armed with this hybrid digital-physical (HDP) intelligence, networks are always ready and responsive, employing outcomes of their what-if analysis to reconfigure the physical network and ensure resilience.  <br/><br/>The project aims to utilize a combination of techniques such as network optimization, graph theory, machine learning, experimental measurements, and models that mix physical and virtual contexts. The project will advance networking technologies in three inter-related thrusts, followed by a comprehensive system-level analysis and validation, including: 1) Generalized prediction frameworks that learn critical performance indicators for spatio-temporal awareness and cross-domain knowledge, linking them to handle network disruptions; 2) Multi-scale approach to creating and evolving a network digital replica with sufficient details that is faithful to the physical network to assist with resilience-centric awareness; 3) Hybrid digital-physical optimization with a stabilization-driven mechanism to uncover multi-dimensional physical reconfigurations.  <br/> <br/>The project will develop a comprehensive educational plan that includes a pre-college STEM virtual laboratory, new network intelligence-centered course materials, and hands-on activities using the designed software tools and testbeds.

Here, the notion of ?distance? is varied and hence highly expressive: It can include familiar settings such as the 3-dimensional world in which we live and the geometry of curved surfaces, and it covers important notions of proximity within, for examples, social networks, collections of proteins or images, the Internet, and many more; such geometries typically reside in high dimensions and seem nonintuitive or strange in comparison to our Euclidean surroundings. A paradigm that has proven to be ubiquitously powerful and useful to a rich variety of pure and applied investigations is embedding a geometric space of interest into a ?nicer? space in which one knows how to perform important tasks (e.g., discovering clusters, efficient storage, compression and optimization, and many more). Typically, this goal cannot be achieved without distorting distances, so the pertinent issue is determining the rate of growth of the smallest possible distortion. This is the overarching theme of the project, which is devoted to resolving central issues and longstanding mysteries of the field. For example, it is not even known how much distances must be distorted, in terms of the total number of objects, when one wishes to represent them in the 3-dimesnional space in which we reside. As another example, while famous and very important work in the 1980s and 1990s determined the largest possible rate of growth of the distortion required to embed a finite metric into Euclidean space (without restricting the target dimension as done above), it remains a longstanding conundrum whether this worst-case scenario can occur when the collection that we wish to embed is a subset of a classical space of vectors (e.g. when distances are measured in terms of the sum of powers of the differences of coordinates, or collections of matrices with natural notions of distance such as the so-called nuclear norm, which occurs in settings ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and signal processing). When the distortion is shown to grow slowly, as it often does (this entails devising a meaningful geometric embedding), the project harnesses it to devise efficient algorithms for a range of scientific tasks. On the flip side, demonstrating that there is no embedding with small distortion entails obtaining insights and devising tools that are useful and interesting in their own right (e.g., meaningful ways to decompose geometries). The project is devoted to addressing specific open questions in the above directions, as well as deriving unforeseen applications and developing overarching methodologies. The project will include a major effort to train and mentor graduate students and early career researchers through the PI?s advising role and his leadership roles in the mathematics research community. <br/><br/>It is common in analysis and geometry that solutions to natural questions about representing objects using other simpler objects cannot be done without incurring large errors. For example, Bourgain?s famous embedding theorem states that any finite metric space can be embedded into a Hilbert space with bi-Lipschitz distortion of order the logarithm of the number of points, and subsequent work showed that this cannot be improved. However, if the given metric space is a subset of a classical space such as a Lebesgue space, a Schatten-von Neumann trace class, or a subset of a discrete group such as the Heisenberg group or the lamplighter group, can one say anything about its embeddability properties other than merely that it is a metric space? It also remains a longstanding open question to determine the growth rate of the largest possible distortion that is required to embed a finite metric space of a given size in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. As a final example, suppose that we are given a 1-Lipschitz mapping from a subset of a finite dimensional normed space to a Banach and we wish to extend it to a Lipschitz function that is defined on the entire ambient space and whose Lipschitz constant is as small as possible: How must this Lipschitz constant grow with the dimension? This is open even for Euclidean space. The project studies the above questions, and many more along those lines. When low distortion is possible, it yields structural insights that are impactful elsewhere, including algorithm design; such applications are pursued in this project after embedding theorems are proved. The project also studies impossibility results showing that large distortion must be incurred; this involves developing new geometric structural insights and tools in harmonic analysis, probability, isoperimetry, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conformal fractals are intricate geometric objects generated via iterated schemes of conformal (angle-preserving) transformations, and they have numerous interdisciplinary applications in mathematical physics, computer graphics, and data science. Measuring the size of conformal fractal attractors has been one of the central themes in the evolution of modern dynamical systems. One of the most well-known ways for measuring such complex geometric objects is the concept of Hausdorff dimension, which provides a robust way of determining the roughness of a set, extending the idea of dimension beyond integer values. The Hausdorff dimension of conformal fractals cannot be derived via simple analytic closed formulas, and obtaining effective and rigorous estimates becomes a challenging computational problem. The scope of this project is to introduce new methods from numerical partial differential equations with the scope of developing versatile, rigorous, and efficient methods for computing the Hausdorff dimensions of various conformal attractors.<br/><br/>The project's topic is naturally interdisciplinary, encompassing a wide range of problems across Real and Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Numerical Analysis, and Large-Scale Computations. The goal is to derive accurate and rigorous Hausdorff dimension estimates for a broad class of conformal fractals by integrating techniques from finite element methods, dynamical systems, and fractal geometry. Finite element analysis is a well-established approach for approximating solutions to a wide range of partial differential equations, with numerous refined methods developed over the years to ensure accurate and reliable numerical results. In contrast, the field of rigorous computation of Hausdorff dimensions for conformal limit sets is still in its infancy. The primary innovation of this project lies in adapting numerical methods typically used for solving PDEs to the estimation of Hausdorff dimensions. This new methodology demands deep analytical foundations and the development of novel theoretical results, presenting significant challenges, especially within the broader context of conformal graph-directed Markov systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional admittance-matrix-based power grid topological models have been shown to lack analytical capabilities to effectively model ubiquitous flexibility, capacity, and prosumer profiles and enable granular and accurate controls of the ultra-high-dimensional distributed energy resources. This project aims to transcend the state-of-the-art, and will develop a data adaptive graph generation module, topological data analytical techniques with multiple filtrations, higher-order network models, and input layers for deep neural networks that take topological signatures and higher-order interactions for (dynamic) networks. The project will integrate ubiquitous, high-dimensional information structures on transmission nodes by taking properties of power systems as special directions and designing new perspectives at the intersection of algebraic topology, commutative algebra, and deep learning. Fundamentally, this project will directly benefit local and national interests as well as guide the modeling, operation, and control of wide-area power transmission networks with ultra-high-dimensional penetration of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems. The project framework will serve as a tool to enhance the reliability and resiliency of power grids, improve power systems quality. Developments from this project have the potential to significantly lower energy costs, directly benefit national economic growth, and substantially reduce the frequency and severity of power outages caused by extreme weather events.  In addition, students working on this project research will acquire an excellent orientation of cross-disciplinary work and experience at the interface of computer science, mathematics, data science, and electrical engineering.<br/><br/>This project is a first attempt to bring the emerging machinery of adaptive graph structure learning, topological data analysis, simplicial complex-level representation learning, and (geometric) deep learning to power grids. Thus, this project will fundamentally redesign existing power grid topology and uncover the fundamental mechanisms of embedding ubiquitous, local topological information, and high-dimensional structures on transmission nodes via higher-order topological graph models and learning methods. Furthermore, the project techniques will include generalizable capability and so can be applied to many different settings involving dynamic networks. These approaches and newly developed topological and higher-order interactions representations learning modules will pave the way for new research directions in computational topology, machine learning and data science. Moreover, the project will contribute an open-source software library to obtain topological summaries learned from the multifiltration of power system data based on techniques developed within the project. These tools in return will enhance new applications of machine learning and deep learning tools for large-scale power system analysis that are deemed infeasible today due to high computational costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology uses mechanical recycling to turn discarded apparel into high quality fibers. The U.S. throws away over 17 million tons of apparel and textiles every year. Less than 15% of discarded textiles in the U.S. are recycled, which means a valuable resource is going to waste. By blending these recycled fibers with new plant- or animal-based fibers, the collective fiber length is long enough for spinning into new yarn and manufacturing new textiles. The solution utilizes perennial flax, where the fiber can be harvested in spring and fall with minimal inputs and no tilling for several years.  the use of perennial flax preserves soil from erosion and promotes soil health. Wool from alpaca and sheep provide the long carrier fibers for the mechanically recycled fibers which allow textiles made from these recycled-natural fiber blends to be mechanically recycled again. As the procurement of these grown or recycled fibers as well as manufacturing yarn can happen locally, this can create a regional circular textile economy.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of recycled fiber-natural blends that meet textile manufacturers' specifications. This solution connects regional industries to create new jobs in recycling, agriculture, and manufacturing for rural economic development. Two novel technologies are combined to create recycled yarn from discarded apparel: a mechanical fiber shredder textile recycling technology, that recycles textiles into fibers and threads and a novel perennial flax breed that provides an alternative to more resource-intensive annual flax - with long fibers suitable for spinning into yarn. Utilizing existing mini mill yarn spinning technologies, these fibers combine to form functional yarns of many colors, weights, and plies. Replacing products' new fiber with recycled fiber reduces water use, land use, and air pollution. Recycled fibers come in an array of colors, removing the need to dye textiles thus reducing water pollution.

While these three classes of evolution equations are well-understood in the one-dimensional spatial setting, the questions of existence, regularity and large-time behavior of solutions for the more realistic multi-dimensional models are mostly open. The plan of this project is to develop novel paradigms to address these questions with emphasis on the multi-dimensional setting.

(i) Euler Alignment. The system of Euler Alignment arises as the large crowd dynamics of the Cucker-Smale alignment model. The goal is to study the open question of existence of multidimensional strong solutions, subject to sub-critical initial data, and their large-time behavior with short-range communication kernels. (ii) Nonlinear Conservation Laws. Nonlinear scalar conservation laws admit a regularization effect, where the entropic time evolution of bounded data gains spatial regularity of fractional order s< 1/3. The 1/3 barrier, at least in two or more dimensions, remains an open problem. The project will address this open problem by refining a velocity averaging lemma adapted to deal with one-signed measures and quantify fractional regularity in proper Morrey spaces. (iii) The Pressure-less System.  In one-dimension one encounters the inviscid Burgers? equation.  A standard embedding of the system into vanishing pressure is limited to one dimension by the formation of delta-shocks. The goal is to construct vanishing viscosity solutions of the Zeldovich pressure-less system in two or more dimensions.

The quality of the AM printed components depends on the quality of the powders that feed into the AM machine. If not closely monitored and controlled these powders can cause manufacturing defects. Qualifying feedstock powders is critical to ensuring repeatability, part quality, and performance, especially in industries like aerospace, medical device, and automotive, where safety and performance standards are strict. This solution provides a powder spreadability testing device that addresses this challenge. The adoption of this device has the potential to increase product quality and consistency, reduce machine downtime, reduce powder waste, and shorten the development cycle for powder bed-based additive manufacturing. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a testing device that can accurately test and quantify the spreadability of feedstock powders for powder bed-based additive manufacturing processes. The powder testing methods currently used in the additive manufacturing industry test the flow behavior of powders as bulk assemblies, meaning that the powder is being studied as a group, not particle-by-particle. Furthermore, the conventional powder testing methods cannot capture the powder behavior under actual additive manufacturing conditions, which requires assessing the spreading behavior of powders as a thin layer (normally 30-100 micrometers) between a substrate and a recoater, the mechanical device that spreads a thin, even layer of powder across the build platform. The commercialization of this technology could increase the competitiveness of the U.S. additive manufacturing industry and promote the adoption of additive manufacturing processes in the aerospace, healthcare, and energy industries for mission critical components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, crude oil is separated into various fractions to give gasoline, lubricants, asphalt, etc. Alcohol and water are separated to produce spirits and bioethanol for fuel. Such separation processes are highly energy-intensive. Energy efficiency may be improved by using adsorptive or membrane-based separations using nanoporous materials, which are materials with pores that are a few nanometers wide. But mixtures confined within nanopores behave differently from unconfined mixtures. This project will identify general principles governing the behavior of mixtures within confined environments. The project will combine experiments, computer modeling, and machine learning to predict mixture behavior in nanoporous materials. The results will help improve the energy efficiency of chemical separation processes. Additional benefits to society will come from teaching data science to engineering students, as well as outreach activities to engage K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>A detailed understanding of adsorption equilibrium in chemical mixtures is critical to design optimal sorbents for separation processes. However, acquiring mixture adsorption data by experiments or computations is time- and resource-intensive. The challenge becomes severe for multi-component mixtures because the amount of data needed increases steeply as the number of components in the mixture increases. Therefore mixture adsorption is often predicted from single-component adsorption data, relying on models such as the ideal adsorbed solution theory. Yet, such models are known to fail for many non-ideal mixtures. This project will develop a systematic understanding of non-ideal adsorption in zeolites using the framework of the real-adsorbed solution theory. To accomplish this objective, the research team will study aqueous polar mixtures confined within zeolite nanopores using atomistic simulations and experimental techniques. The team will examine the effect of zeolite structure, and the impact of hydrophilic defects and cations, on the phase behavior of mixtures. These insights will be used to construct a deep learning model that can predict adsorbed-phase activity coefficients from the topology and geometry of zeolite structures. The ultimate goal of this project is to create an expert system that can predict a wide range of nonideal adsorption behaviors under confinement. The project will develop curricular course modules on machine learning at the undergraduate level, promote undergraduate research, and conduct outreach activities at the pre-college level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In such computational-imaging systems, the optical hardware collects informative measurements that are subsequently analyzed by computation to produce high-quality, human-interpretable images. Although these systems promise unprecedented access to previously unobserved physics and biology, existing mathematical techniques used to study their performance capabilities and jointly optimize their constituent frontend optics and backend algorithms are imprecise and deficient for many emerging applications. Consequently, this project aims to introduce new mathematical tools to tackle these deficiencies and establish a framework for unlocking the maximum potential of computational-imaging systems, especially in applications ? such as single-photon lidar, focused-beam microscopy, and imaging with no line of sight ? wherein images are to be computed from extremely weak and noisy measurements. Societal benefits include the integration of art-infused initiatives as a high-impact pedagogy that aims to improving student engagement in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The convention for assessing the conditioning of computational-imaging systems is based on computing condition numbers and singular values. This computation presupposes an interest in worst-case performance over some fixed, pre-chosen discretization. Unfortunately, this approach can lead to incorrect conclusions, including the impossibility of imaging even where imaging is possible, especially when conditioning is not spatially uniform. With the proliferation of computational imaging in myriad applications, the time is ripe for a precise and unified framework for studying the fundamental limits of computational-imaging systems. This project will achieve this goal by using the notion of information orthogonality to separate ill-conditioned spatial directions from well-conditioned ones, allowing for more precise characterizations of conditioning. Precise characterizations will enable system-level design optimizations and new, efficient algorithms that augment existing reconstruction methods to yield substantial improvements in imaging quality and efficiency and even unlock new imaging capabilities and modalities. While this project focuses on computational-imaging systems and corresponding inverse-imaging problems, it will also contribute more generally to the theory and practice of inverse problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>Earth?s energy budget is balanced between incoming solar radiation and outgoing thermal energy.  Clouds exert a significant impact in both directions, but there has been significantly more study of the impact of clouds on incoming energy from the sun.  This project will focus on the opposite route, the emission of longwave, or infrared, radiation from the Earth?s surface and how that radiation interacts with ice clouds in the high latitudes.  The impact of this study will be to provide better information to the scientific community on processes that are important for understanding the warming Arctic region.  The project will also enhance collaboration between US and UK scientists and provide training for early career researchers.<br/><br/>This project addresses three primary research questions: (1) Do current representations of surface properties capture the longwave emission spectrum of snow and ice surfaces correctly? (2) Is a new light-scattering model able to reconcile ice cloud microphysics (ice crystal sizes, shapes) with energetic (radiative) impact across the longwave spectrum? (3) Can our radiative transfer models successfully match simultaneous observations of the longwave energy spectrum at the surface, within the atmosphere and at the top of the atmosphere under a variety of different atmospheric and surface conditions?  The research team will address these questions through a multi-faceted plan.  First, the team will use measurements from a new instrument, called the Far-INfrarEd Spectrometer for Surface Emissivity (FINESSE) that has been deployed in Norway and Canada in the past few years.  The deployment in Canada was matched with airborne observations of clouds, providing both radiative and cloud properties to the research team.  This data will be used to evaluate a new ice cloud optical property model, assess the impact of snow and ice emissivity models in an Earth System Model, and combine the ground and airborne data with satellite observations to achieve radiative closure from the surface to space across the infrared spectrum for the first time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discrete mechanisms studied in the project lend themselves to numerical investigations where undergraduate students play an important role, contributing to the wide dissemination of the underlying ideas and training of the next generation of mathematicians. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will study a broad-based approach to Fourier restriction that seeks to unify results in discrete, Euclidean, and Riemannian manifold settings. We begin by proposing a restriction theory-based approach to Fourier uncertainty signal recovery in a discrete setting. The PI will employ variants of Bourgain's Lambda(q) theorem to cover the cases that are currently out of reach. This will lead the PI naturally to the study of annihilating pair inequalities where the ideas in the project lead to results in discrete, continuous, and manifold settings. The PI will engage in a systematic study of the uncertainty principle on Riemannian manifolds where we circle back to the probabilistic bounds that arise in the discrete signal recovery part of the proposal. The uncertainty principle on manifolds leads the PI to study random sampling on manifolds where the strong unique continuation property of the Laplace-Beltrami operator plays the key role. The question of the stability of the proposed sampling result leads the PI to study the smallest singular values of the resulting matrices, which have natural applications to the signal recovery part of the proposal. Finally, the PI will develop a comprehensive approach to the spectral synthesis problem previously studied by Agmon, Agranovsky, Hormander, Narayanan, and others.

This project advances what is known about attitude formation and attitude changes, by examining how geographic contexts shape the formation of attitudes and influence the quality of interpersonal interactions.<br/><br/>This project tests three questions derived from an interdisciplinary mathematical model of attitude formation. This model draws inspiration from social psychology and urban science to explicitly account for interactions at different spatial scales. Specifically, the project tests: (1) How much do attitudes vary across place and spatial scale? (2) How much can the nested contexts of cities and neighborhoods explain about attitude formation? (3) How much variation in attitudes across spatial scales and places is related to the quality of local interpersonal interactions? To support training for students and researchers, the project also includes the development of an online course and a set of example data analysis pipelines demonstrating the application of these methods.

A healthy spring bloom of phytoplankton called diatoms, in turn, is important to the lake food web and in mitigating against harmful algal blooms that can affect water quality. However, very little is known about winter nitrogen cycling in any of the Great Lakes, including Lake Erie, arguably one of the most important resources in the country in terms of drinking water supply, recreation, and fisheries.

By combining nitrogen cycling rate measurements with community composition data, they will also investigate how different nitrogen substrates may favor certain phytoplankton groups (e.g., diatoms, dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria) across seasons. Over three years the team will 1) Measure ice onset, duration, and thickness throughout winter sampling; 2) track water column nitrogen substrate pools (nitrate, ammonia, organic nitrogen) and rates of uptake/transformation; 3) examine seasonal phytoplankton abundance and gene expression; and 4) conduct stable isotope probing experiments to measure cell-specific nitrogen incorporation in winter phytoplankton communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, model theory refers to a branch of mathematical logic: roughly speaking, model theorists study mathematical structures by studying the expressive power of abstract languages that describe them. Over the last few decades, the abstract perspective of model theory has led to the discovery of certain surprising patterns across different areas of mathematics. A key such pattern is Zilber's trichotomy: this is a general observed phenomenon in which sufficiently well-behaved mathematical structures (in the sense of model theory) tend to have one of just three basic forms. This is an imprecise phenomenon -- but recent work has increased our understanding of when and how it can be formally studied. This project aims to expand on such recent work, using the latest techniques to find more precise and true instances of the trichotomy. The PI then plans to use new cases of the trichotomy to expand applications of model theory in other areas of mathematics, with a particular focus on certain aspects of geometry and combinatorics. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project has four main goals. First, building on recent work, the PI will seek to prove new instances of the Zilber trichotomy for relics of structures of geometric interest. The main questions of this form concern relics of o-minimal structures and relics of algebraically closed valued fields; in each of these cases, the status of the trichotomy has seen substantial recent progress but remains open. Second, the PI will use new instances of the trichotomy to study reconstruction problems in geometry -- focusing particularly on reconstructing algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields from partial data. This will generalize the work of Zilber on recovering a curve from its Jacobian variety: the goal is to prove stronger and more general statements of the same type, using the latest trichotomy results as a tool. Third, the PI will investigate broader interpretations of the trichotomy, weakening the usual assumption of strong minimality to similar notions of tameness, such as geometric structures?the hope being that a wider array of trichotomy-style theorems will allow for a broader array of geometric applications. Finally, the PI will investigate pseudo-finite variants of the trichotomy in the hope of finding new applications to incidence problems in combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program provides both undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on fundamental research experience in the field of thermal management for next-generation aircraft. As the aviation industry works to reduce emissions, lower operating costs, reduce noise, and increase design flexibility through electric and hybrid-electric technologies, there is an urgent need for new cooling systems that are both efficient and lightweight. Through this project, each cohort of participating U.S. students spend ten weeks in Brazil collaborating with researchers and gaining exposure to international aerospace industries. The program emphasizes teamwork across cultures and disciplines. Collaboration with Brazilian experts strengthens the scientific outcomes and prepares students for global careers in thermal science engineering. <br/><br/>Propulsion electrification presents various environmental and technological hurdles. Among these obstacles lies the need for effective thermal management systems that are both lightweight and capable of handling the increased heat generated by all-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft, a demand surpassing that of traditional aircraft designs. Fundamental understanding of the heat transfer performance is crucial because many of these materials and thermal management solutions have not been previously used in the intended area of operation for electric and/or hybrid electric aircraft. This IRES project addresses knowledge gaps and equips students with a deep understanding of fundamental issues and the thermal behavior of various heat transfer media before their implementation into critical thermal management systems. The research activities in this IRES program are centered around two major thrusts. These themes focus on highly promising yet not fully understood heat transfer media and approaches: 1) solid-to-liquid phase change materials for passive thermal management and 2) transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems for active cooling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, more complex use cases in different areas of science and beyond are emerging, where even higher accuracy is needed for sub-milliseconds tasks. In these conditions, more complex architectures need to be accelerated with dedicated hardware, by deploying them, for example, on specialized chips like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This award will develop a FPGA-accelerated graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve the real-time data filtering systems employed by high energy particle physics experiments. This work will not only promote the progress of science, but its impact can potentially transcend the field of high-energy particle physics, with potential applications in quantum computing, where it can improve the readout and control of qubits, or in autonomous navigation, where hardware-accelerated GNNs can improve the simultaneous localization and mapping of drones used for search and rescue.<br/><br/>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN  will undergo a high-luminosity (HL) upgrade in 2030. It will deliver denser collisions, which will result in a dataset ten times larger, suitable for searches for rarer physics processes, as well as for higher precision measurement of particle properties. However, more particles per collision will be produced with increasing radiation. To cope with this, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment will upgrade its detector by installing a new radiation-hard high-granularity calorimeter (HGCAL). The HGCAL will have six million read-out channels and will produce hundreds of terabytes of data per second. Therefore, new techniques are required to reconstruct and select in real-time the most physics-sensitive collisions. This award will build a research program to improve the online HGCAL particle reconstruction used in the CMS real-time data filtering system, known as the ``trigger'', with cutting-edge GNNs deployed on FPGAs. By processing detector ""images"" as compressed by an auto-encoder, using directly the latent space and avoiding the decoding, the GNNs will perform a reconstruction that fits within the latency budget while, at the same time, making use of the information from the full detector. To achieve this, lightweight learning models that can balance simplicity and efficiency will be produced. In particular, for this project, virtual nodes augmented GNNs will be used to effectively capture both short and long-range interactions in spatially extended cell groups. Lightweight models for predicting particle groups will be explored, by for example, fast clustering in the latent space. The project will develop an ultra-low-latency FPGA accelerator to implement these new GNNs, which is also generic to enable algorithm/hardware co-design. The project will utilize Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNIC) to perform GNN-specific edge embedding computation together with cross-machine communication, to reduce system-level latency and to improve scalability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The gyrfalcon is the largest falcon in the world and breeds almost exclusively in the Arctic, which is currently experiencing an unprecedented rate of environmental change. As a top avian predator, the gyrfalcon is a sentinel of Arctic health. Milder winters are altering the ranges and migration patterns of many animals, which has introduced novel vectors of disease to Arctic systems. There is a need to study the effects of new pathogens in the Arctic and to characterize immune competence mechanisms in wild populations. Arctic birds are important for understanding these mechanisms, given their social and ecological value, long-distance dispersal potential, and ability to transmit disease to other animals and people. This award builds capacity at Boise State University to use cutting-edge approaches, including the generation of whole genomes of birds and their gut microbial communities, to understand the relationship between mechanisms of immune competence and disease presence in this iconic raptor species. The research is timely because it explores the ability of scientists to test for resilience to diseases that are affecting birds and people globally, including highly pathogenic avian influenza. This proposed work will broaden participation in the sciences for K-12 and undergraduate students, by supporting an Adopt-a-Scientist event and the development of undergraduate research-based curriculum, and will also support interdisciplinary research training of three undergraduates and two graduate students.<br/><br/>The effects of new and expanding pathogens on natural Arctic systems remains poorly understood, highlighting the need to identify and monitor immune competence mechanisms in wild populations.

However, achieving this requires overcoming key challenges, including handling irregularly sampled data, integrating sparse yet critical failure-time information, and addressing privacy concerns in data-sensitive applications. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research that aims to develop a scalable predictive modeling framework that leverages both high-dimensional sensor signals and failure event data for online system failure prognosis while preserving industrial data privacy. By combining longitudinal analysis, survival modeling, and decentralized learning methodologies, this approach looks to enhance predictive accuracy and enable robust decision-making in industrial settings. If successful, the project will significantly advance data-driven monitoring, prognostics, and contribute to the emerging personalized predictive maintenance activities. Beyond research, this project intends to enrich undergraduate education by integrating real-world applications into classroom learning, providing students with hands-on opportunities to engage in model development, simulation, and testing in predictive maintenance and reliability. Additionally, the research will offer K-12 students opportunities to engage with cutting-edge technologies, fostering a new generation of innovators ready to tackle future challenges.<br/><br/>The project seeks to advance industrial prognostics by developing a new federated survival analysis tool, enabling robust failure predictions from heterogeneous sensor data without compromising industrial data privacy. The research focuses on three key objectives: 1) reimagining survival analysis through federated learning to enhance prediction accuracy by leveraging decentralized data sources, 2) facilitating adaptive failure predictions that dynamically adjusts to changing system conditions using Bayesian theory and multivariate functional principal component analysis, and 3) rethinking data fusion in federated survival analysis to seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data sources, thus ensuring a holistic view of system health. Research completed in association with this project could be critical for industries where timely failure forecasting can drastically reduce downtime, improve operational efficiency, and enhance safety.

Shocks are created in space plasmas when a supersonic flow interacts with an obstacle such as a coronal mass ejection (CME) or a planet. For example, interplanetary shocks are often driven by interplanetary CMEs propagating through the solar wind. The downstream region between the shock and the ejecta is commonly known as the sheath. Additionally, pairs of forward-reverse shocks can form at stream interaction regions (SIRs) due to the compressive interaction of fast and slow solar wind streams. These interplanetary shocks will interact with turbulent solar wind fluctuations. Another example is the Earth?s bow shock, which is created by the solar wind slowing down upon reaching the Earth?s magnetosphere. Strong turbulence is generated downstream of the bow shock, known as the magnetosheath. For the Earth?s bow shock, the upstream region is also affected by backstreaming particles, leading to a foreshock region where the fluctuation level is enhanced compared to the quiet solar wind. In both cases of interplanetary shocks and planetary bow shocks, the shocks interact with turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind. <br/><br/>The complete problem of the interaction between low-frequency MHD wave modes and different shock geometries has not been systematically investigated. This project is to investigate this interaction; specifically, how upstream incident waves are transmitted and reflected upon interaction. The following objectives will be achieved: (1) To extend the present theoretical model of MHD wave-shock interaction to a more general case. Quantifying the differences caused by the shock geometry, shock strength, field and plasma parameters, and upstream incident wave mode. (2) To understand the relationship between the MHD waves observed upstream and downstream of heliospheric shocks through spacecraft data analysis guided by the theoretical framework of MHD wave-shock interaction.

However, most educational games primarily focus on individual problem-solving rather than teaching collaborative decision-making in dynamic environments. Many real-world decisions require collaboration, where people must work together, consider different perspectives, and balance personal goals and collective success. Yet, existing platforms designed to support teamwork are often too rigid, complex, or time-consuming to customize, limiting broader adoption in education. This project addresses these challenges by developing an AI-powered  educational game platform that supports collaborative decision-making through real-time and adaptive feedback. Through gamification, learners engage in dynamic group scenarios where they explore the consequences of their choices, refine strategic thinking, and improve teamwork. By making collaborative decision-making education more interactive, personalized, and accessible through customizable features, this project benefits educators, students, and professionals, expanding opportunities for decision making training across educational and professional settings.<br/><br/>To meet these goals, this project has three key objectives. First, the project will develop a cognitive tutor enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs). This tutor will infer human intentions and predict decision-making strategies, providing personalized feedback while adapting its responses to enhance teamwork and group coordination. Second, the project will leverage gamification in team-based settings to design a customizable platform that integrates strategy simulators with reinforcement learning agents and a real-time learning analytics dashboard. Educators and researchers can adjust game parameters to create a flexible and scalable learning environment. Learners can also explore and refine decision-making strategies using strategy simulators and learning analytics. Finally, the project will evaluate the platform?s effectiveness in improving collaborative decision-making. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will assess task performance, collaboration effectiveness, and user trust and engagement. This research will provide an interactive framework for studying human behavior in dynamic group settings. It will also deepen understanding of social decision-making and lay the groundwork.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, what if human behavior affects the state of the world, changing the information the planner can share? This problem is called ?endogenous information design:? strategically providing information about the world in situations when the state of the world depends on behavior. This problem appears in many smart infrastructure systems: for example, a smartphone app that warns drivers about a traffic accident encourages cautious driving, which reduces the risk of follow-on accidents. However, this safer driving also changes the traffic conditions, which affects the app?s future warnings. This circular relationship creates complex challenges for decision-makers in systems like transportation networks, public safety, and smart technologies. This project will develop new theoretical models and mathematical tools for analyzing these types of situations. These findings will have impact across many fields including economics, transportation science, and operations research. Furthermore, the project will include a series of traveling summer schools which will visit universities across the US to educate graduate students on these new techniques. In addition to the summer schools, the project will involve outreach to K-12 students, undergraduate researchers, and members of the public.<br/><br/>This project will pose, characterize, and apply a novel family of game-theoretic models called ?endogenous Bayesian games.? These games substantially extend classical Bayesian game theory by letting the distribution of states-of-the-world be a function of agent behavior, concisely and cleanly capturing the circular informational dependencies inherent in many smart infrastructure systems. The project will apply a three-pronged approach to (1) develop analytical foundations for this new theory, (2) apply these novel tools to a problem of information design in smart and connected transportation networks, and (3) characterize and optimize the robustness of the policy recommendations generated by these models. This project?s findings will enable information design in important settings for which no tools currently exist, filling an important gap in the scientific literature and providing social planners with new analytical capabilities for conducting information design in these settings.

It will be made available under an opensource license to enable others to use and modify the software to suit their needs. The research questions are focused on understanding the impacts of the tool on students' behavior, performance, and learning of computing theory; whether students from different types of institutions are impacted in significantly different ways; and the effects of various types of feedback on students' learning. The tool's added functionality, improved usability, and availability as opensource software will encourage its adoption at other institutions and increase its educational benefits. The project, including the upgraded feedback tool and the associated research study, will provide new insights into pedagogical approaches for improving student learning and will help students to be better prepared to develop high-quality software.

Engineering design is an approach for optimizing objective(s) (e.g., minimizing the drag of an airplane) while fulfilling design requirements (e.g., maintaining a lower limit of the lift generated by the airplane). Engineering design has achieved success in broad areas, including automobiles, aircraft, spacecraft, energy systems, and manufacturing equipment. Conventional design optimization, however, faces the following two challenges in practical applications. 1) Objective values and design requirements typically need to be computed hundreds or even thousands of times, which significantly slows down the optimization process. 2) Practical optimization typically involves complex design requirements, which make it difficult to find real optimal solutions. To overcome these challenges, this project will investigate developing an approach that ensures all design requirements are automatically fulfilled during the optimization process. If successful, this approach can reduce optimization complexity and increase optimization efficiency.<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a generative artificial intelligence approach for design requirement fulfillment, along with surrogate models to enable near real-time computation ? ultimately supporting rapid engineering design. Generative artificial intelligence can learn from existing data (e.g., takeoff trajectories of electric drones) and generate similar data patterns (e.g., smooth takeoff trajectories without sudden drops). Surrogate models, also known as predictive models, are fast approximations of time-consuming mathematical models. In this project, generative artificial intelligence models will be guided by surrogate model predictions to assess whether design requirements are fulfilled by the generated designs. This feedback loop allows the generative artificial intelligence to generate designs that inherently fulfill all design requirements during optimization. Performance of the developed approach will be evaluated using an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an electric drone verified using NASA?s Dymos framework, as well as on two aerodynamic design benchmark problems developed by the AIAA Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group. In summary, this research project seeks to enable rapid engineering design under complex design requirements while maintaining high accuracy on the resulting optimal solutions. Moreover, this project aims to discover new knowledge about how design requirements can be effectively fulfilled using generative artificial intelligence and surrogate models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This branch of convex geometry is called geometric tomography. An important instance of this theory is x-ray tomography, which has numerous applications in science, medicine and engineering. The PI has developed a new approach to geometric tomography in which the geometric properties of convex bodies are expressed in terms of integral transforms, enabling the use of certain analytical methods to solve geometric problems. In this project, the PI plans to further develop these techniques and apply them to a range of problems at the interface between convex geometry, functional analysis, harmonic analysis and probability. For example, can one find an algebraic equation whose solutions are sections of a given solid? Can one estimate the volume of a solid from data involving areas of certain sets of sections or projections of this solid? Which random variables are stable, i.e. have the property that the sums of several copies of these variables always reproduce the same variable up to a constant? The PI will continue to work with students and early career stage mathematicians, to introduce them to this evolving area of research. <br/><br/>The problems considered in this proposal connect several areas of mathematics - convex geometry, functional analysis and probability. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results - the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. The PI plans to consider the lower-dimensional and non-symmetric versions of the Busemann-Petty problem asking whether a convex body with uniformly smaller areas of plane sections necessarily has smaller volume. Another direction is to study comparison problems and lower estimates for the Radon transform associated with volumetric results about convex bodies. The PI plans to study algebraic properties of the Radon transform related to the problem of Arnold, going back to Lemma 28 from Newton's ``Principia."" The problem is to characterize those convex domains whose cut-off area is an algebraic function of the parameters of the cutting plane.

Topology is the study of geometry where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other.  The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  Topological computations have also been applied to solve problems in physics, and the field of topological data analysis applies the tools of algebraic topology to the qualitative study of high-dimensional data-sets.  The focus of the project is on the interaction of localized and unlocalized computations of homotopy groups.  Homotopy groups are the fundamental algebraic invariants which arise from geometric objects but are often very difficult to compute.  These computations are made more accessible through the process of localization (inverting classes), but this process of localization loses information.  The project will enhance our understanding of how to extract information about delocalized homotopy groups from these localizations.  Activities in this project will also contribute to the training of the next generation of mathematicians.<br/>  <br/>The specific research activities center around the recent disproof of the Telescope Conjecture by Burklund-Hahn-Levy-Schlank, which implies that the relationship between K(n)-local homotopy groups and unlocalized homotopy groups is much more subtle than previously imagined.  The PI will complete our understanding of the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere in the last open case of p = 2 using a new elliptic resolution, and the relationship of this resolution to the tmf-resolution will be leveraged to relate the extensive low dimensional computations of Isaksen-Wang-Xu of 2-primary stable stems to the K(2)-local computations.  Generalizations of the effective slice spectral sequence to other groups will be investigated using the techniques of synthetic homotopy theory.  The PI will also investigate genuine equivariant enhancements of synthetic homotopy categories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite advancement in treating wet wounds, existing products fail in the management of burn wounds, causing excessive pain, infection, prolonged healing, and poor functional and aesthetic restoration. This project introduces a novel bioactive hydrogel dressing with a breathable, porous contact designed to accelerate natural healing processes and reduce the trauma associated with dressing changes and body movement. The transparent appearance and bioactive formulation of the proposed dressing allow for non-invasive assessment of the wound and maintain optimal moisture levels for up to 10 days, reducing the frequency of dressing changes. The proposed dressing's extended operational time and enhanced stability offer an effective solution that lowers overall treatment costs, reduces hospital visits, and alleviates the workload on healthcare professionals. This hydrogel dressing is poised to fulfill a substantial demand in the US wound care market by addressing the critical gaps in existing treatments for second-degree burns and other low-exuding wounds such as necrotic wounds and radiation-induced dermatitis.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to develop a novel dressing prototype, composed of natural hydrogels enriched with bioactive compounds, utilizing 3D printing technology. Burn wounds are prone to dehydration, which can cause dressings to adhere to the wound bed, resulting in pain and trauma during removal. The proposed project aims at developing hydrogel dressings with porous surface to distribute the pull-off force across an extended interface area, reducing trauma during the dressing removal. The proposed project will evaluate the antibacterial properties of the dressings, as wound infection significantly delay healing and increase complications. Additionally, the project aims to assess the dressing's anti-inflammatory effects by measuring the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a preclinical mouse model. The anticipated technical results include the fabrication of 3D-printed dressings in various sizes, shapes, and pore designs, evaluating their mechanical stability and distribution of pull-off force, followed by validation of their antibacterial activity and ability to modulate inflammatory responses. Achieving these milestones will result in an advanced wound dressing prototype for second-degree burn wounds, supporting its safety and effectiveness in promoting favorable inflammatory response and wound healing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, occasional collisions between just two particles can lead to significant changes, such as the creation of charged ions through electron impact, the release of immense energy in nuclear fusion reactions, and the redistribution of energy and momentum through scattering. While physically accurate models exist to describe both collective interactions and binary collisions in plasmas, they are too complex to solve directly. Instead, simplified models have traditionally been used to predict plasma behavior, including nuclear fusion processes. Recent high-performance inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments have produced unexpected results that differ from predictions based on these simplified models. This discrepancy suggests that a more precise, high-fidelity kinetic model is needed to fully understand and optimize fusion reactions. This research project aims to develop a novel computational approach that integrates data compression techniques, fast numerical methods, and advanced mathematical modeling to make high-fidelity plasma simulations feasible on modern supercomputers. By applying this new model to experimental data, plasma behavior can be more accurately reproduced, providing insights that could lead to the design of even more efficient ICF devices, and ultimately improving fusion technologies.<br/><br/>Plasma is a state of matter whose intrinsic properties are governed by collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles.  In many high-temperature plasma applications, such as fusion energy, binary collisions that include atomic and nuclear reactions and elastic scattering are essential to accurately describe kinetic physics. However, the exceedingly complex nature and high dimensionality of the governing kinetic equations for such high-temperature plasmas severely challenge current numerical methods.  Recent advancements in fast algorithms for the collision operator and low-rank tensor methods have facilitated addressing this difficult problem. The project aims to develop and apply these low-rank computing techniques to numerically solve the governing equations of kinetic physics in a multi-species, reacting plasma with computational efficiency.  The numerical method will be applied to explore kinetic physics in a high-temperature fusion plasma that is undergoing atomic reactions, such as ionization and nuclear fusion reactions releasing energetic charged products that heat the bulk plasma through elastic scattering.  These processes are foundational to the operation of fusion plasma devices. The computational methods to be developed in this project have the potential to provide high-fidelity kinetic simulations for fusion plasmas at a manageable computational cost. The novelty of the approach is represented by four key elements: mathematical formulation of reaction collision operators, fast spectral method for the collision operators, low-rank decomposition in the velocity space, and algorithm implementation on GPU systems. The research project will enable unprecedented first-principles modeling of kinetic physics in reacting plasmas, unraveling recent experimental results, and offering new insights into intricate multiscale high-temperature plasma dynamics for optimizing future devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, Hurricane Katrina (2005) caused over 1,500 deaths and total estimated damages of $75 billion in the New Orleans area and along the Mississippi coast as a result of storm surge. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has been used widely to understand, monitor, and predict these rare natural hazards.  The Gaussian process (GP) modeling framework is one of the most widely used tools to address such UQ applications and has been studied across several areas, including spatial statistics, design and analysis of computer experiments, and machine learning. With the advance of measurement technology and increasing computing power, large numbers of measurements and large-scale numerical simulations at increasing resolutions are routinely collected in modern applications and have given rise to several critical challenges in predicting real-world processes with associated uncertainty. While GP presents a promising route to carrying out UQ tasks for modern emerging applications such as coastal flood hazard studies, existing GP methods are inadequate in addressing several notable issues such as computational bottleneck due to big datasets and spatial heterogeneity due to complex structures in multi-dimensional domains. This project will develop new Bayesian GP methods to allow scalable computation and to capture spatial heterogeneity. The new methods, algorithms, theory, and software are expected to improve GP modeling for addressing data analytical issues across a wide range of fields, including physical science, engineering, medical science, public health, and business science. The project will develop and distribute user-friendly open-source software and provide interdisciplinary research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new Bayesian multi-scale residual learning framework with strong theoretical support that allows scalable computation and spatial nonstationarity for GP modeling. This framework integrates and extends several powerful techniques respectively arising in the literature on GP and that on multi-scale modeling, including predictive process approximation, blockwise shrinkage, and random recursive partitioning on the domain. This framework decomposes the GP into a cascade of residual processes that characterize the underlying covariance structures at different resolutions and that can be spatially heterogeneous in a variety of ways. The new framework allows for adoption of blockwise shrinkage to infer the covariance of the residual processes and incorporates random partition priors to enable adaptivity to various spatial structures in multi-dimensional domains. New recursive algorithms inspired by wavelet shrinkage and state-space models will be developed to achieve linear computational complexity and linear storage complexity in terms of the number of observations. The resulting GP method will guarantee linear computational complexity in a serial computing environment and also be easily parallelizable. This Bayesian multi-scale residual learning method provides a new approach to addressing GP modeling issues among spatial statistics, design and analysis of computer experiments, machine learning, and nonparametric regression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a combination of bacteria applied via seed coating to reduce soybean disease outbreaks, reduce soybean fertilizer needs, and increase soybean yield. Currently, the United States remains heavily reliant on imported organic soybeans, with over 80% sourced from countries such as Turkey, India, and Argentina. This project aims to support American soybean farmers in transitioning to organic production by providing them with a solution that can replace pesticide and fertilizer applications that are used in conventional agriculture. The successful execution of this project would thereby reduce dependence on imports and strengthen domestic agricultural markets. By increasing local organic soybean supply, this effort has the potential to enhance economic resilience and contribute to the national agricultural sector. Beyond economic and commercial benefits, this project also supports societal benefits like property health concerns from nitrogen fertilizer run-off. In the United States, improper nitrogen management contributes significantly to algal blooms and fish die offs in waterways, thus solutions such as this project can reduce nitrogen fertilizer use thus reducing nitrogen run-off.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to address challenges faced by organic soybean growers related to plant pathogens and nitrogen availability. This research aims to develop a microbial seed coating that enhances organic soybean production by simultaneously reducing pathogen-associated yield loss and improving nitrogen fixation. The overarching goal is to develop a bacterial consortium that promotes soybean disease resistance, nitrogen fixation, yield, and soil nitrogen availability. The proposed project will achieve these objectives through a set of field and greenhouse trials designed to evaluate the impact of the seed-applied bacterial consortium on soybean growth and productivity. Specifically, these trials will assess disease resistance to damping-off pathogens, including Fusarium, Pythium, and Phytophthora, through disease incidence scores and stand counts. Additionally, soybean tissue nitrogen concentration and final yield will be measured to determine consortium effects on nitrogen fixation and productivity. Post-harvest soil samples will be analyzed to quantify residual nitrogen availability. Rhizosphere samples will be collected throughout the growing season and examined to identify microbial strains associated with improved plant and soil characteristics, facilitating iterative optimization of the consortium. These findings will contribute to the development of an effective microbial inoculant for organic soybean production, enhancing both disease management and nitrogen efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some savannas, including Brazil?s cerrado, fire is necessary, helping to maintain open tree canopies and allowing a continuous and highly diverse grass layer to thrive. Exactly how fire should be managed to conserve cerrado biological and functional biodiversity remains unclear, however. This work focuses at the interface of stewardship and research to evaluate how fire is being managed in protected areas in Brazil?s cerrado, whether fire policies are effective for conserving vulnerable fire-dependent cerrado plants, and how fire may be used as a tool to increase cerrado resilience. This work will advance scientific understanding of fire and the maintenance of ecosystem function and biodiversity in savannas, as well as ensuring that Brazil?s national fire policies promote biodiversity and ecosystem function across all of Brazil?s ecoregions. The project will elegantly integrate societal benefits (determination of how well management practices and policies are working) and a variety of training and outreach with cutting-edge research.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the research interrogates a) how a new legal framework in Brazil (Law 12651) allowing for the development of integrated fire management policies in protected areas and on private lands has changed fire regimes in flammable savanna ecosystems, b) whether the policies developed under this framework are appropriate to conserving fire-dependent biodiversity in Brazil?s cerrado, and c) the extent to which cerrado ecosystems and biodiversity are vulnerable in a conservation context and whether fire management can be used as a tool to increase cerrado resilience. To do this, methods will involve combining detailed remote sensing mapping of fire history across cerrado protected areas, intensive site-based work in six protected areas, and mapping of cerrado vulnerability. The six field sites encompass four national parks and two ecological field stations. The work will reach a broad set of participants, including both researchers at Yale and Unicamp and managers at the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação e Biodiversidade, via a series of participatory management workshops aimed at synthesizing existing fire policy and disseminating information to participants. The managers will gain experience in field work and receive guidance on the importance of fire for biodiversity conservation.

Online accounts increasingly play a central role in people?s wellbeing, acting as the gateway to email, finances, social networks, geographic locations, and even domestic home environments. However, a growing amount of evidence suggests that people who face heightened threats to their digital safety are often targeted by abusive adversaries; adversaries who bypass trusted authentication mechanisms for unauthorized access to victim accounts, enabling further harassment, surveillance, and control. <br/><br/>The research agenda has four aims. The first will lead to a better understanding of experiences of targets such attacks, support professionals, and abusive adversaries through qualitative, stakeholder investigations. The second will complement this knowledge by cataloguing existing management tools and emerging authentication mechanisms as provided by online services via new forms of measurement studies and new framework for analyzing the abusability of account management tools. The third will offer new designs of account management tools to improve detection and investigation into illicit accesses, refining them via design provocation studies with relevant stakeholders. The fourth will create new empirically-grounded interventions for the targets to restore their digital safety, and the perpetrators of attacks to deter technology abuse at its source. The intellectual contributions of the work include: 1) new analytical frameworks for assessing illicit client-side access to accounts; 2) new frameworks for reasoning about UI-bound attacks and the abusability of tools; 3) new design patterns for account security management that can be applied widely; and 4) new direct interventions with both the targets of such attacks and abusive adversaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the reactions chosen for exploration in this project lie at the interface between two well-defined reaction classes that are understood by the community to operate according to different sets of rules. These rules are not well understood. A central goal of the program is to learn more about these ambiguous, underexplored reactions, and understand the behavior of systems designed to occur at the ?edges? of an accepted paradigm of reactivity. Other anomalous reactions slated for investigation are expected to enable the Frontier lab to build three-dimensional molecules with unique spatial arrays of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms. These structural features are critical to the behavior of small molecules, and new arrays could uncover new possibilities for chemical reactivity or biological activity. The research conducted by Professor Frontier and her students will expand the range of three-dimensional molecules that can be assembled using chemical methods.  Professor Frontier also continues to develop and maintain the ?Not Voodoo? website, an educational resource she created in 2004.  The site is designed to help students demystify laboratory protocols and procedures. It serves hundreds of organic experimental chemists each day, from students just beginning independent research, to advanced students looking for tips or tricks.<br/><br/>In this program, all three research projects focus on anomalous versions of otherwise well understood reactions. The first two projects will explore reactions at the edges of known electrocyclic chemistry. In project 1, the team will explore the interface between electrocyclic and ionic reactivity, seeking to characterize a large group of pentannulation reactions of ambiguous classification.  The examples have been collected over many years, comprising cases from the PI?s work and others that stand out as atypical and potentially misclassified. In project 2, the team aims to extend the boundaries of electrocyclic reactivity by developing synthetically useful higher-order cationic electrocyclizations and evaluating both periselectivity and degree of pericyclicity. The findings from projects 1 and 2 will establish parameters for classifying cyclization reactions, which can be applied by members of the community to characterize a new or existing reaction. In project 3, Professor Frontier and coworkers will develop nonlinear polyene cyclizations for the synthesis of highly functionalized, topologically complex heterocycles. When the p-orbital systems of polyene reactants are arranged in a nonlinear fashion, and cationic chemistry is initiated, a combination of cyclization and [1,2]-rearrangement processes can ensue. Through experimentation and analysis, the lab will learn to control these nonlinear cascades. Professor Frontier will also execute expansions and improvements within the Not Voodoo website she created in 2004.  Activities will include routine maintenance, compiling case studies that highlight problem-solving strategies used by experts, updating and reorganizing existing content, and adding new technical content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For those with limited digital literacy, this growing use increases their exposure to cyber risks. One of the most common and concerning risks they face is so-called Dark Patterns, that is, user interface designs that trick users into making unintended decisions such as giving their consent to unwanted subscriptions or revealing personal information. Dark Pattern designs can also make it difficult for these users to opt out of data collection. It is therefore crucial for people who are not computer experts to become more aware of and educated about these risks. Unfortunately, current cyber education is generally limited to generic warnings and lacks real-world examples to effectively and safely educate them and fails to keep pace with the rapid evolution of dark patterns, especially as AI and machine learning are increasingly employed.<br/><br/>This project is bridging the critical gap by developing a dark patterns learning platform aimed at raising people's awareness of dark patterns and improving their literacy in navigating dark patterns in real life. By integrating knowledge and methodologies from dark patterns research, educational science, human-computer interaction, and software engineering, the platform provides real-world experiential components, is especially tailored for older adults and those lacking computer expertise. The investigators of this project are prototyping and tailoring the learning platform through formative evaluation, evaluating the effectiveness of the platform through expert inspections and evaluation, and refining the system by developing an updating framework that enables non-technical educators to make no-code updates. The investigators are also robustly evaluating and broadly disseminating the learning platform to local and nationwide communities, and training researchers in dark pattern education and mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the U.S. advances toward exascale computing and increasingly data-centric scientific discovery, the ability to analyze and process large amounts of data efficiently is paramount in nationally significant domains such as energy systems, artificial intelligence (AI), astrophysics, and precision health. This project focuses on Computational Storage Devices (CSDs), a transformative technology that embeds processing power directly into storage hardware, dramatically reducing data movement and enabling faster, more energy-efficient computation. However, programming and optimizing CSDs remains highly complex, limiting their impact. This project develops a scalable, automated software infrastructure (including compilers, runtime systems, and programming interfaces) that makes it practical to deploy and benefit from CSDs across diverse and critical HPC workloads of national importance. By unlocking the potential of near-storage computing, this project directly contributes to national priorities such as AI, energy systems, and advanced manufacturing. Additionally, the project produces open-source tools, CSD-focused benchmarks, and educational resources, contributing to the U.S. leadership in next-generation computing while preparing a workforce equipped to tackle the grand challenges of tomorrow.<br/><br/>As modern HPC applications become increasingly data-driven - integrating traditional simulations with machine learning and data analytics - the overhead of moving data between storage and compute units has emerged as a major performance and energy bottleneck. CSDs promise to mitigate this issue by embedding compute engines within storage devices (e.g., solid state devices), allowing select computations to be executed near the data. However, current CSD programming models are low-level, hardware-specific, and lack standardized abstractions, making them difficult to adopt at scale. This project addresses these limitations through five integrated research thrusts: (1) characterizing diverse HPC workloads across real and simulated CSD configurations to identify offload opportunities and performance tradeoffs; (2) exposing CSDs to the software stack via rich abstractions and interfaces that communicate device heterogeneity, memory capacity, and compute capabilities; (3) developing compiler-directed optimizations for code and data placement, loop parallelization, and CSD-to-CSD data migration; (4) designing a runtime system that dynamically manages code fragments offloaded to CSDs, handles multi-application scheduling, and coordinates compute/data mapping with the compiler; and (5) building a simulation platform for futuristic CSD architectures and releasing a benchmark suite tailored to CSD-aware optimizations. Together, these efforts will lower the programming barrier to CSD adoption, enable intelligent orchestration across heterogeneous storage-side compute resources, and advance the state of the art in near-storage computing. Scientifically, this project aims to establish foundational tools, abstractions, and methodologies that accelerate the integration of CSDs into production HPC systems, drive innovation in compiler-runtime co-design for heterogeneous storage environments and enable new levels of energy-efficient performance in data-intensive scientific workloads.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The very rapid development of high performance computing platforms, together with a similar emergence of highly accurate algorithms, allow the treatment and modeling of complex systems that were intractable just a few years ago. The use of Artificial Intelligence, including Large Language Models and Machine Learning techniques, has opened a new venue for computational approaches. In parallel, automated scientific instruments create massive amounts of measurements that demand modern scientific computing methods to process and understand. However, computational science will only fulfill its full potential if advances in undergraduate education accompany the advances in hardware and in numerical and data-based models. Frequently, students learn little, if any, computational science in the classroom and are not prepared for computational science or data science research. This project provides an evidence-based approach to address these issues and prepare the next generation of students. The 30 undergraduate students participating in this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be engaged in authentic computational science projects, learn how to use state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure tools, manage large amounts of data, experience activities that characterize research careers, and work in interdisciplinary research teams. The faculty mentors will provide activities that help students understand the nature of multidisciplinary research and the value of working as a team. These skills have the potential to be transformative in both the students' education as well as in their future careers.<br/><br/>The Louisiana State University's Center for Computation & Technology (CCT), with its research activities organized into interdisciplinary focus areas that span traditional academic departments, provides an ideal setting for the REU students to experience interdisciplinary research. With research groups working on problems like gravitational waves, complex emergent phenomena in material science, and computational arts, the participants will be working on cutting edge research in computational science. An extensive training component will remedy any weak preparation of students in computational science, providing knowledge on how to leverage state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure tools. At the conclusion of the REU, students are encouraged to continue their research and present their work at their home institution, informing others about computational science.

To solve this mystery, microscopic objects, electrons, are placed close to a macroscopic everyday world object, a wall. From a practical perspective, it has been proposed that the interaction between electrons and walls limits how small an object an electron microscope can see. If the effects of this interaction can be overcome, we may improve electron microscopes. A second objective of this project is to look at the microscopic, quantum properties of a group of electrons close to each other. Now we have changed the interaction between an electron and a wall to the interaction between electrons. It is predicted that these quantum properties can be used to further improve electron microscopes. The research project provides training for graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students in quantum science, which is an area of national need. The technologies we develop, which include visualization of our work with Augmented Reality headsets, are aimed to strengthen the national economy.<br/><br/>The work is done by using electron diffraction from a nanofabricated grating to make a coherent electron quantum wave. By placing a gold coated wall close to the electron wave, we not only decohere the wave, but Caldeira and Leggett also predict an electron energy loss. If we can find the decoherence-energy loss relation, we have demonstrated Quantum Dissipation Theory, and our understanding of the Quantum Measurement Problem has deepened. Using three nanofabricated gratings we have pioneered, we have built an electron-wave, Mach-Zehnder interferometer. With this device we will add even more to our understanding of quantum effects by searching for a newly proposed space-time topology of the celebrated Aharonov-Bohm effect. This quantum effect is especially profound, as it combines relativistic space-time with quantum waves. Finally, a 10-femtosecond laser pulse is used to pull pairs of electrons from a sharp nano-needle. Electrons with the same spin cannot be emitted in the same state, or in other words, cannot be quantum degenerate according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This affects the arrival time relation between the electrons. The arrival time cannot be the same, but only when the electrons start very close to each other. Our goal is to push electron-electron quantum degeneracy to a level where it could be used for a new type of imaging: electron-electron quantum correlation imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although cooperative species tend to be found in harsh environments characterized by drought and unpredictable rainfall, it remains unclear why. Nearly all previous work has established global patterns between social behavior and environment by comparing different species in different habitats. Yet, determining why environmental harshness favors cooperation requires within-species studies across different habitat types rather than just among-species correlations across the globe. By combining field experiments and long-term observations, studies of brain morphology and gene expression, and theoretical modelling, the researchers will establish the largest within-species study of cooperation ever attempted in social wasps that span a range of more than 4000 km across Sub-Saharan Africa. From arid deserts to lush rainforests, Africa?s most widespread wasp Belonogaster juncea is ideally suited to study the links between the environment and cooperation. Using populations in Cameroon, Kenya, and South Africa, the researchers will work at a continental scale to help transform the field of social evolution. Results will be of interest to biologists and social scientists studying cooperation broadly; AI deployment will benefit researchers tracking individuals in complex environments; and our international team (USA, UK, Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Taiwan) will promote capacity-building in Africa. The researchers will also provide outreach across continents, enthusing audiences about animal societies and the potential for ?big picture? experiments to solve fundamental problems in biology.<br/><br/>Paper wasps have long been considered classic models for studying cooperation. The researchers will use the wide-ranging African wasp Belonogaster juncea to test, for the first time in an insect, ideas relating environmental variability to social evolution. By combining (1) field-based behavioral experiments and AI approaches to social network analysis, (2) mechanistic studies of brain transcriptomics, micro-CT-scanning, whole-genome resequencing, and AI approaches to morphological evolution, and (3) evolutionary simulations and game theory models, the researchers will pursue four primary objectives. First, they will test whether aridity amplifies the value of cooperation through field experiments in different environments. Second, they will test whether harsh environments promote peaceful cooperation by making conflict too risky, deploying AI to dissect social networks. Third, they will test the key prediction that seasonal environments drive members of cooperative groups to adopt specialist roles, combining integrative approaches to dissect molecular and morphological phenotypes. Finally, they will examine which environmental conditions likely fostered the origin of cooperation in the ancient ancestors of wasps by developing evolutionary simulations and mathematical models based on real-world data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>Earth?s energy budget is balanced between incoming solar radiation and outgoing thermal energy.  Clouds exert a significant impact in both directions, but there has been significantly more study of the impact of clouds on incoming energy from the sun.  This project will focus on the opposite route, the emission of longwave, or infrared, radiation from the Earth?s surface and how that radiation interacts with ice clouds in the high latitudes.  The impact of this study will be to provide better information to the scientific community on processes that are important for understanding the warming Arctic region.  The project will also enhance collaboration between US and UK scientists and provide training for early career researchers.<br/><br/>This project addresses three primary research questions: (1) Do current representations of surface properties capture the longwave emission spectrum of snow and ice surfaces correctly? (2) Is a new light-scattering model able to reconcile ice cloud microphysics (ice crystal sizes, shapes) with energetic (radiative) impact across the longwave spectrum? (3) Can our radiative transfer models successfully match simultaneous observations of the longwave energy spectrum at the surface, within the atmosphere and at the top of the atmosphere under a variety of different atmospheric and surface conditions?  The research team will address these questions through a multi-faceted plan.  First, the team will use measurements from a new instrument, called the Far-INfrarEd Spectrometer for Surface Emissivity (FINESSE) that has been deployed in Norway and Canada in the past few years.  The deployment in Canada was matched with airborne observations of clouds, providing both radiative and cloud properties to the research team.  This data will be used to evaluate a new ice cloud optical property model, assess the impact of snow and ice emissivity models in an Earth System Model, and combine the ground and airborne data with satellite observations to achieve radiative closure from the surface to space across the infrared spectrum for the first time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One viable way to mitigate CO2 emission is through an operation called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). In CCS, CO2 is captured from power plants, and injected into underground saline aquifers. However, injection of CO2 into geologic formations leads to dissolution of minerals due to the acidic nature of CO2, which can create leakage pathways and threaten the safety and security of CO2 storage. Therefore, an accurate knowledge of mineral dissolution in saline aquifers is needed to design effective, safe, and efficient CCS operations. The goal of this project is to bridge this knowledge gap through coordinated lab experiments and numerical simulations. Innovative fabrication, flow visualization, and simulation techniques will be combined to understand the chemical and physical processes that drive rock dissolution. More broadly, successful completion of this research can also benefit studies on agriculture, soil formation, and underground cave geology, as similar processes occur in these systems. Further benefits to society will result from diversifying the STEM workforce through training and education of female and Native American students, creating YouTube contents as educational materials for the public, and supporting two major campus-wide outreach events including the Earth and Science Explore Camp and Montana State Family Science Night.<br/><br/>Reactive dissolution of minerals in porous media is pervasive in natural and engineered systems. The greatest challenge to understanding these porous media systems is that dissolution rates measured in the lab are typically orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field, referred to as the ?lab?field discrepancy?. This mismatch not only poses strong challenges in developing accurate predictive models, but also highlights a lack of fundamental knowledge of mineral dissolution. It has been hypothesized the lab-field discrepancy is primarily due to concentration gradients resulting from incomplete mixing within individual pores that are in turn subject to heterogeneous flow fields at the microscopic scale. Unfortunately, little data or understanding is available on the pore-scale processes that occur during mineral dissolution because of the difficulty in directly measuring flow dynamics and transport at the pore level. The goal of the proposed research is to achieve a transformative understanding of pore-scale transport and chemical reaction in porous media to reconcile the long-standing ?lab-field discrepancy.? Successful resolution of this problem will pave the way for more accurate macroscopic predictions. This will be achieved through a coordinated experimental and simulation framework employing microfluidic micromodels and the lattice Boltzmann method. The micromodels will be fabricated in naturally occurring calcite, which enables the precise construction of porous media closely representing real geological systems. Dissolution will be induced by injection of hydrochloric acid at various concentrations and flow rates to simulate realistic CCS operations. Interactions between pore-scale flow and mineral dissolution will be directly quantified, providing valuable insight into the underlying physics to facilitate proper upscaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award supports an effort to advance the predictive modeling capabilities of low-temperature plasmas (LTPs) for improved fabrication of microelectronics systems. LTPs are weakly ionized gases that play an important role in many industrial applications, including materials processing, spacecraft propulsion, and hypersonic flights. Predictive models of LTPs can help to advance the understanding of how to control physical and chemical processes within a low temperature plasma, and how to design the next-generation industrial systems. The main objective of this project is to develop theoretically accurate and computationally efficient models that can capture the critical physical and chemical processes in LTPs. The research will be conducted in conjunction with Applied Materials, which will help enhance industry workforce development in the United States.<br/> <br/>Fluid equations are typically derived by taking the moments of the first-principles gas kinetic equations, such as the Boltzmann equation. The main problem of the state-of-the-art fluid models for LTPs, including drift-diffusion models and local approximation, is the inability to account for nonlocal effects of electrons. While kinetic models, such as particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision simulations, capture such nonlocal phenomena, the computational cost is often much more expensive than fluid models, limiting their utility as design tools for industrial applications. The project aims to bridge the gap between fluid and kinetic models by developing closure models based on high-order moment models (HOMMs) that capture nonlocal and kinetic effects of LTPs. Specifically, the research objectives are to: (i) revisit and develop HOMMs, solving for the moments up to the fourth moment, including mass, momentum, pressure, heat flux, and kurtosis; (ii) investigate stochastic heating and nonlocal heat flux effects in RF-driven plasmas; and (iii) apply the HOMMs to study microwave plasmas used for microelectronics fabrication.<br/><br/>This award is jointly supported by the Division of Physics and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite recent advances, most of the research on manifold optimization is limited to centralized approaches not implementable in multi-agent systems. This CAREER project takes a substantial step towards the development and adoption of decentralized manifold optimization (DMO) in large-scale, multi-agent optimization by overcoming three fundamental challenges: scalability, efficiency, and adaptation to dynamic environments. The PI proposes three integrated research thrusts to address these challenges. (i) Thrust 1 will fundamentally advance the scalability of DMO by innovating decentralized retraction-free methods that are computationally efficient, and it will also extend the theory of retraction-free methods to bilevel DMO. (ii) Thrust 2 will provide a systematic understanding of acceleration to improve the iteration complexity of DMO algorithms. This research will establish provably fast convergence guarantees for accelerated DMO and further expand this theory to the zero-order setting using smoothing techniques to generate high-fidelity gradient estimators. (iii) Thrust 3 will pioneer online DMO to contextualize multi-agent Riemannian optimization in dynamic, unpredictable environments. It will investigate projection-free methods to replace costly projection operations with efficient oracles and further extend the study to functional constrained online DMO by developing decentralized Riemannian augmented Lagrangian methods. <br/><br/>The proposed research in this CAREER project will produce and draw upon novel scientific tools in Riemannian optimization, multi-agent systems and control, high-dimensional statistics and concentration inequalities.

Misdiagnosis or delayed treatment can lead to serious problems, including unnecessary reliance on opioid medications. Currently, doctors mostly depend on patient self-reports and their own judgment, but that doesn?t always give the full picture of the need for pain medications. Some patients struggle to communicate their pain, and important biological signals?like heart rate and hormone levels?often go unnoticed. This solution is an artificial intelligence system that can analyze multiple sources of information, including language, behavior, and biological data, to provide more accurate insights. By improving diagnosis, the technology aims to reduce ineffective treatments and contribute to a more scientific approach to managing chronic pain. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a digital phenotyping platform that combines natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and metabolic signal analysis to identify patterns in chronic pain expression. The system analyzes patient-generated language, behavioral patterns such as daily activity and self-management strategies, and physiological signals such as glucose variability to generate a multidimensional profile of the pain experience. This integrated approach advances current assessment methods by incorporating linguistic and biological dimensions often overlooked in conventional tools. The platform supports clinical decision making by providing real-time, individualized insights and has applications in electronic records integration, population-level analytics, and data-informed personalized care.

A central goal of microbiome science is to discover what causes the microbiome to change, and the broader consequences of such change. A consistent pattern emerging from this research is that the microbiome is seasonal: an animal in spring, for example, will have a very different microbial makeup from one in fall. But what causes the microbiome to change? And do seasonal microbiome changes influence the timing of critical biological events, such as hibernation? Answers are urgently needed, because increasingly erratic and extreme weather is knocking the life cycles of animals and plants out of sync, and in turn, jeopardizing wildlife populations and the many services they provide to society. How the microbiome is involved, and how it may be harnessed to maximize the stability of natural and agricultural ecosystems, are currently unknown. This project will focus on these open questions through experiments and field studies involving bumble bees. General principles resulting from this research will ultimately improve prediction and management of microbiome change in wildlife. Further, findings will inform specific strategies to protect bumble bees, a threatened group of pollinators that is vital for agriculture. This project will also support educational initiatives designed to help grow the science and technology workforce. The researchers will train teachers in scientific practices through a workshop and co-create an experiential learning program for high school students in Anaheim, CA. Finally, a course will be developed at the University of California, Irvine, in which undergraduate students actively participate in microbiome experiments.<br/> <br/>This project will develop bumble bees as a model organism with which to determine general drivers and life-history consequences of microbiome seasonality.

However, practical demonstrations of such communication links in the microwave to millimeter-wave frequency band have been limited.

Lattice based cryptography is a foundation for advanced cryptographic  schemes that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Secure cryptography is essential for digital communication, for example for ensuring the safe transfer of sensitive financial data.  The new mathematical advance behind this project is the efficient construction of lattices that have both addition and multiplication operations and that are more densely packed than the ones now typically used in cryptography. The central goals of the project are to improve these constructions, to develop faster algorithms to operate on these lattices, and to build more efficient cryptographic applications using them.  <br/><br/>The technical advances in this project concern number fields with small root discriminants. This project will study the computational complexity of constructing such number fields and of performing arithmetic operations in them. Prior work on infinite families of number fields with small root discriminants has focused on existence theorems. This project will build on work of two of the P.I.s on efficient explicit constructions of such families.  The goal is to improve these constructions using a variety of mathematical techniques including Galois cohomology, explicit Chebotarev theorems and recent advances on Hilbert's 12th problem via p-adic methods and modular forms. Another goal is to develop fast Fourier methods for performing arithmetic operations of the kind needed in cryptography. The relevance of number fields with small root discriminants was noted by Peikert and Rosen in 2006. They showed that such fields lead to very small connection factors relating the difficulty of solving the worst case of the short vector problem to the difficulty of solving the average case of the short integer solution problem. The cryptographic protocols to be studied using the rings of integers of the above fields include collision resistant hash functions, homomorphic commitment schemes, streaming authenticated data structures, zero-knowledge proof systems, and some types of digital signature schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In semiconductor manufacturing, small solid particles, such as dust particles, are a source of contamination. Microchips made from silicon wafers are ruined when a particle lands on its surface during one of the manufacturing steps. Many of these steps involve a plasma to etch or deposit thin films. During these steps, small particles of nanometer or micron size can flake from chamber walls, or grow in the plasma itself, and then fall to the wafer and contaminate it. In this project, a recently invented method of mitigating this contamination is explored to gain an understanding of the physical processes involved towards developing even better mitigation methods. These methods involve applying an electric charge to the particles before they fall on the wafer, and using electric forces to lift and eliminate the particles before they contaminate the wafer. This project includes K12 outreach, course development, and training of both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This collaborative research effort by the University of Iowa and Appalachian State University focuses on the plasma afterglow, which is the condition lasting a few milliseconds after turning off the radio-frequency electrical power that had sustained the plasma. It is during an afterglow that particles can fall to a wafer and contaminate it. An afterglow occurs also during the off-time in modulated-power operation, which is commonly used in manufacturing. During the afterglow, the particle?s electric charge changes rapidly. It was recently discovered that the residual charge can be controlled by applying voltages to electrodes in the plasma chamber during the afterglow, thereby allowing an electric force to lift the particles and reduce the number that fall to the wafer. In this project, understanding of processes in the afterglow will be expanded by performing experiments and simulations. In the experiments, particle charge and movement during modulated plasma operation will be measured by video microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These detailed, multi-platform studies will be the first to fully exploit existing data sets to address fundamental problems that are vital for achieving NSF?s strategic goals. Such events may affect technological systems, astronauts and spacecraft, electrical power grids, and other important technologies that modern society has come to depend on.

In addition, although gravity has been studied for hundreds of years, gravitational forces between microscopic particles that obey the laws of quantum mechanics have never been measured, and theories of gravity may need to be modified in the quantum realm.

Synthetic plastics and rubbers are essential and ubiquitous products in everyday life, serving as important materials for a wide variety of applications. Though many of these materials find alternative end-of-life uses, our current ability to recycle these materials is very limited. This proposal will investigate novel ways of transforming simple petroleum byproducts into functionalized plastics and rubbers with higher levels of control over the microscopic chemical structure and its tunability. The key to this approach is the use of a unique catalytic functionalization of commodity polymers that can add a wide range of functionality in controllable proportions. Using this catalytic reaction, this project will prepare a variety of new plastics and rubbers and investigate their physical properties. Additionally, this project will develop methods that allow the initial transformation to be chemically reversed, thus regenerating the original material and allowing its reuse in new applications. This functionalization/defunctionalization process will enable a circular life-cycle for these materials, in which they can continually be restored to their original state and then subsequently re-functionalized and reused for novel purposes. The broader impacts of this work will be to allow more sustainable, predictable, and tunable access to plastic and rubber materials, and to greatly improve those materials? usability and reusability at a fundamental chemical level. This technology stands to change how rubber materials are used and re-used across diverse industries.

Using this catalytic method, this project will also develop methods for generating thermoset materials from synthetic thermoplastic rubbers that retain the parent alkene microstructure. Additionally, a novel method for deamination of the functionalized thermoplastic and thermoset materials based on the formation and elimination of hydrazides will be developed, thus allowing the functionalized materials to be chemically reverted to their original state in a traceless fashion.

However, accurately and efficiently simulating these equations remains a major challenge due to their complexity and sensitivity, which demand a careful balance of precision and speed, along with the use of stable numerical schemes to ensure reliable results. This project develops robust and efficient numerical algorithms for solving wave equations, optimized for high performance on both current and next-generation computing platforms. These computational tools will advance foundational research and have wide-ranging applications in areas where accurate wave prediction is critical. Beyond technical innovation, the project supports the development of a skilled scientific workforce by training graduate researchers and engaging students through reading groups and seminars. These educational initiatives promote participation in computational mathematics and contribute to the nation's continued leadership in science, engineering, and technological innovation.<br/><br/>The main computational challenges associated with nonlinear second-order wave equations stem from their rich and intricate range of behaviors. These equations can exhibit solitary waves, solitons, finite-time blow-ups, singularities, and rapid oscillations.  These equations, often derived from Euler?Lagrange equations, carry intrinsic geometric and energetic structures that critically shape their dynamics.  Standard numerical approaches typically reformulate them into first-order systems, which increase computational cost and potentially compromise key physical properties.  Building on the investigator?s prior success with numerical methods for (semi-)linear second-order wave problems, this project aims to address these challenges.  The goal is to design numerical schemes specifically tailored to the nonlinear second-order formulation, emphasizing stability, high accuracy, computational efficiency, and fidelity to the underlying physics.  In particular, the research will focus on constructing fully discrete, structure-preserving energy discontinuous Galerkin methods and applying them to complex physical systems, such as geometric wave models and coupled first- and second-order hyperbolic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alongside this work, the PI will contribute to the mathematical training of STEM learners from middle school on up. <br/><br/>The two streams used by the PI can be encapsulated as ""higher Lie theory"" and ""resolvent problems"".  Both build upon fundamental inquiries at the interface of group theory, geometry and topology, and homotopical algebra. For the first major stream, the PI will establish analogues of Lie?s Second and Third Theorems for finite type L-infinity-algebras and finite dimensional Lie infinity-groups. For the second major stream, the PI will continue his ongoing investigation of resolvent problems and Hilbert?s 13th problem in three interrelated ways: a) initiating the study of resolvent degree of finitely generated groups, with a focus on braid groups and arithmetic lattices; b) developing new methods for generating solvable points on varieties, and use this to give p-adic analogues of Klein?s modular solutions of polynomials of low degree (with a focus on degree 8 and below); and most speculatively, c) seeking to find invariants capable of detecting nontrivial lower bounds on resolvent degree.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through workshops, internships, and public education programs at the Hawai?i Institute of Marine Biology, this research engages students and community members in understanding how corals may adapt to changing environments. These educational initiatives focus on student mentorship and training, while research outcomes directly inform conservation strategies to protect reef ecosystems for future generations.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop a mechanistic theoretical framework that models coral adaptation by integrating three key mechanisms: larval connectivity between reefs, genetic adaptation of coral hosts, and dynamics of their symbiotic algae.

These models will quantify how different coral and symbiont characteristics influence adaptation patterns across reef networks under various climate scenarios. The framework can be applied to Hawaiian coral reefs using local oceanographic data to assess their adaptive potential through 2100. Model predictions aim to identify vulnerable coral species and reef areas, as well as potential refugia.

Elements, including nitrogen, dissolved in precipitation are returned to Earth?s surface where plants and other organisms can access these critical life-sustaining nutrients. The global productivity of forests and the surface water quality of streams, rivers, and lakes is often linked to nutrient deposition. There is a rich history of studying nitrogen wet deposition, but previous research has primarily focused on only two forms of nitrogen ? ammonium and nitrate. However, wet deposition includes a third form of dissolved nitrogen: dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). This form of nitrogen is rarely assessed in deposition monitoring programs but can contribute 25-95% of the total nitrogen entering ecosystems via wet deposition. This project will quantify DON in wet deposition using archived samples from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program to understand sources of DON in precipitation, characterize the spatial and temporal variability of DON wet deposition, and investigate the ecosystem consequences of this additional source of nitrogen for organisms including lichens and herbaceous plants. <br/><br/>Atmospheric deposition provides an essential source of nitrogen (N) to ecosystems. There is broad consensus that excess N, as the result of atmospheric deposition, has compromised the health of ecosystems at regional and global scales. This project will use archived precipitation samples from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program National Trends Network to quantify concentrations and loads of DON in wet deposition across the United States. Previous analyses with a smaller set of archived samples indicate a high level of sample stability. The preservation and stability of these scientific collections is significant as researchers can now reevaluate concentrations of other solutes creating a more holistic quantification and characterization of nutrient loads to ecosystems. Using these archived samples, the RAINeD (Rain in the Archives: Innovations in Nitrogen Deposition) project will ask three overarching questions: 1) what are the drivers of spatial and temporal variability of DON wet deposition across ecoregions; 2) what is the relationship between concentrations of DON and other measured solutes and can we hindcast time-series of wet deposition DON; and 3) how are temporal estimates of nutrient critical load exceedances modified with the incorporation of DON? The over-arching hypothesis of this project is that biological processes and sources control the seasonality and magnitude of DON wet deposition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of the spectrum is of central importance in understanding the long-term behavior of such systems. In some examples, the spectrum can be interpreted of as the color of light, or the energy range at which a semi-conductor allows electron travel. To obtain differential operators that are self-adjoint, boundary conditions must usually be imposed; think of a vibrating string that is clamped down or otherwise restricted at both ends, or a vibrating drum. In many examples, we know the complete spectrum of an operator with one set of boundary conditions, while the physical behavior of the same system with other boundary conditions is hard or impossible to compute directly. Perturbation theory will be developed to allow access to the spectral information to a wide class of operators under changing boundary conditions, even though this behavior is often quite unstable. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and engage the PI in conference organization; outcomes of the project will be disseminated widely through research articles and conference presentations.<br/><br/>More specifically, the two parts of this project?s intellectual merit are trace class perturbations of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space, and Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk. The first part concerns the singular spectrum under infinite rank perturbations such as trace class perturbations and beyond. Of particular interest is the development of an Aronszajn-Donoghue-type theory. The proposed methods fall within function theoretic operator theory, but touch to varying degrees harmonic analysis, measure and spectral theory, as well as abstract perturbation theory. In the second part, although Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk was established ?only? in 2020, it has become evident that it harbors a rich theory and is rather distinct from the one-variable setting. To date, investigations for the polydisk are lacking the connection with unitary perturbations, and therefore also to spectral theory and applications. Seeking remedy and providing a systematic study of the field are the main goals. Inspiration is drawn from classical Aleksandrov-Clark theory, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and analytic function theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The enhanced tool developed in this project will initially be deployed and outcomes assessed in theoretical computer science courses at the five collaborating institutions. It will be made available under an opensource license to enable others to use and modify the software to suit their needs. The research questions are focused on understanding the impacts of the tool on students' behavior, performance, and learning of computing theory; whether students from different types of institutions are impacted in significantly different ways; and the effects of various types of feedback on students' learning. The tool's added functionality, improved usability, and availability as opensource software will encourage its adoption at other institutions and increase its educational benefits.

This study will be the first to comprehensively study the nitrogen cycle throughout the year, including in winter when the lake is covered with ice. Recent work in other lakes suggest that during winter, under-ice processes are important in determining the forms of nitrogen available to phytoplankton in spring and summer. A healthy spring bloom of phytoplankton called diatoms, in turn, is important to the lake food web and in mitigating against harmful algal blooms that can affect water quality. However, very little is known about winter nitrogen cycling in any of the Great Lakes, including Lake Erie, arguably one of the most important resources in the country in terms of drinking water supply, recreation, and fisheries. The project will support undergraduate students at both the University of Michigan and Bowling Green State University, and a graduate student at BGSU. The team will create a curriculum module on the Great Lakes and water quality for high school students.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to understand how winter nitrogen cycling impacts nutrient balance and phytoplankton community structure in large, temperate waterbodies, using Lake Erie as a case study. The researchers will generate the first quantitative measurements of nitrification, nitrogen uptake, and ammonia regeneration during winter in Lake Erie, to assess the effects of ice phenology on nitrification rates and how changes in nitrogen availability and speciation may affect seasonal phytoplankton communities. By combining nitrogen cycling rate measurements with community composition data, they will also investigate how different nitrogen substrates may favor certain phytoplankton groups (e.g., diatoms, dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria) across seasons. Over three years the team will 1) Measure ice onset, duration, and thickness throughout winter sampling; 2) track water column nitrogen substrate pools (nitrate, ammonia, organic nitrogen) and rates of uptake/transformation; 3) examine seasonal phytoplankton abundance and gene expression; and 4) conduct stable isotope probing experiments to measure cell-specific nitrogen incorporation in winter phytoplankton communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They constantly stream through the Cosmos, Earth and everything on it, but rarely interact at all. Neutrinos are much lighter than electrons, and their absolute mass is yet to be measured. Neutrinos may also have another unique feature ? a neutrino might be its own anti-particle, a so called Majorana particle. If neutrinos are proven to be Majorana particles, that may provide an answer to one of the biggest puzzles of today: how our universe, and all its matter, came into existence. Although equal amounts of matter and anti-matter were created in the Big Bang, eventually matter prevailed, by a mechanism allowed by neutrino?s Majorana nature. The PI will work on the KamLAND2-Zen experiment, located underground in Japan, that will deploy almost a ton of a Xenon isotope in 1 kilo-ton of liquid scintillator to deliver the most sensitive result in searching for Majorana neutrinos.  Looking for rare processes that indicate Majorana nature of neutrino, is challenging due to many similar event signals that are due to noise and backgrounds. Therefore, calibration of the detector response to light is critical to its success. The PI will build the light calibration system for KamLAND2-Zen to characterize the photodetectors? timing and charge collection, as well as the light transport through different detector volumes. Building the light calibration system will train students and postdocs in designing and building new instruments, creating a skilled workforce for tomorrow.<br/><br/>The PI will search for neutrinoless double beta decay - the intellectual merit is of the highest caliber and could lead to a revolutionary discovery. KamLAND2-Zen is an upgrade of its successful predecessor KamLAND-Zen which has produced world-leading limits on neutrinoless double beta decay in 136Xe. KamLAND2-Zen will begin data-taking in 2028, with a half-life sensitivity of roughly 2 x 1027 years. The PI will fabricate, install, and commission the optical calibration sources for the KamLAND2-Zen experiment. The PI and her group will enhance the sensitivity of KamLAND2-Zen by building a sophisticated optical model of the Xenon-loaded liquid scintillator, unloaded liquid scintillator, and surrounding buffer oil, in addition to getting precise charge and timing calibration of the PMTs. In turn, the enhanced optical modeling will improve vertex reconstruction for rejection of the backgrounds coming from the target volume boundary and reduce systematic error related to target fiducialization. Specifically, the PI will focus on the fabrication of the fiber-based optical calibration sources, electronic boards needed for light injection with a control box, with support for the team to execute the project.

However, natural proteins are often not ideal for these practical uses. Protein engineering, a field that aims to design proteins with improved or novel functions, has transformed industries by creating tailored proteins. While traditional approaches, such as the Nobel Prize-recognized directed evolution method, have been remarkably successful in numerous protein engineering applications, they are typically slow, costly, and resource-intensive. This project seeks to advance protein engineering by combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) methods with advanced laboratory automation. By harnessing the power of AI to predict and design protein sequences and integrating it with an automated experimental platform, this research aims to greatly accelerate the discovery of new proteins, offering immense potential across multiple scientific domains with significant commercial and societal impact on medicine, biotechnology, energy, agriculture, chemical manufacturing, consumer products, and more.<br/><br/><br/>This project introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach leveraging recent AI breakthroughs in large language models and generative models, to guide protein function analysis and protein engineering, unlocking an unparalleled efficiency for functional protein discovery.

CIRM is a well-known international mathematics conference center, and the Principal Investigator of this grant, Professor David T. Gay of the University of Georgia, has been selected as CIRM's ""Jean Morlet Chair"" for the period July-December 2025 for the purpose of organizing  a semester's worth of international activities at CIRM related to his research program in topology. This grant will support the travel and accommodation expenses of US-based mathematicians to participate in some of these events. The research topic, in topology, concerns new methods to study the intrinsic large-scale shapes of a wide range of spaces called manifolds: Manifolds are spaces which at the small scale, look just like the ordinary space around us, perhaps with more dimensions, but which can be tangled up with themselves in strange ways on the large scale. Interesting manifolds arise, for example, when thinking about all the possible configurations of a mechanical system, such as a robot or a human limb, when thinking about all the possible states of a large language model under training in an artificial intelligence system, or when understanding how a protein folds. Trisections, and generalizations of these, give universal ways to decompose manifolds into a small number of simple pieces (often that number is 3) that are easy to understand, so that understanding the large-scale topology reduces to understanding the rules for how these small number of simple pieces can fit together to make a single closed manifold. Besides increasing our understanding of fundamental mathematical objects underlying many scientific applications, a key broader impact of this grant will be to provide opportunities for early career US-based mathematicians from a broad range of institutions to interact with the international scientific community, establish new collaborations and engage in a rapidly developing research field. Compared to many fields within mathematics, the subject matter of this semester of activities presents a relatively low bar for entry and a fairly quick access for the beginner to rich, deep and challenging mathematics, and also presents many opportunities for engagement with the broader public through interesting visualization and illustration activities.<br/><br/><br/>Since Gay?s initial work on trisections of smooth 4?manifolds in 2013, there has been an explosion of activity in the field leading to at least 92 published papers on trisections and related topics listed on MathSciNet. Fundamental questions have been answered and extensive generalizations have been developed, connecting the field to many other important areas in topology. Two distinct relative versions of trisections have been developed, trisections of 4?manifolds with boundary, relative to open book decompositions, and trisections of 4?manifolds with embedded surfaces. Connections with algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry have been developed as well as connections with piecewise linear topology and higher-dimensional topology. In work with Abrams and Kirby, Gay used trisections of 4?manifolds to define group trisections and thus show that the study of smooth 4?manifolds could in principal be completely reduced to group theoretic questions. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and the time is right for an international meeting to survey progress in the field, hear about the latest results, and develop a collective plan for future steps. This is the purpose of the main conference in October, which will be preceded by a week-long Research School to help early career researchers get up to speed. The two workshops, one in July and one in November, will bring together smaller groups of researchers for more focused exploration and collaborative research work on some specific topics related to higher-dimensional generalizations and symplectic geometry.

By pairing laboratory robotics with artificial intelligence, the project seeks to cut formulation time and material use by up to half potentially lowering the barriers of bringing new antibody medicines to patients and expanding access to self-administered therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. This project will serve biopharmaceutical firms developing antibody drugs, an addressable segment estimated at over two hundred million dollars annually. The technology offers a durable advantage through continuously improving artificial intelligence, while revenue will be generated via fee-for-service campaigns that scale efficiently with automation. First adopters are expected to be midsized-large biopharmaceutical companies seeking rapid, low-cost formulation. The technology?s commercial launch is planned within two years, with projected annual platform revenues of approximately three to five million dollars by the third year of production. Broadly, the work advances national health and prosperity by enabling and accelerating the delivery of next-generation biologic medicines.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize a platform discovery pipeline using artificial intelligence to model and predict antibody formulation behavior with Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) excipients. Specifically, this project plans to use an artificial intelligence-driven search to formulate three therapeutic monoclonal antibody drugs that are candidates for subcutaneous administration. This project seeks to rapidly identify formulations enabling therapeutic dosing ([C] > 100 mg/mL), injectable viscosity levels (? < 30 cP), and colloidal stability (Monomer > 98%).  To accomplish this, the projects aims to build and implement a platform discovery pipeline using artificial intelligence / machine learning to model and predict formulation behavior with GRAS excipients. These models aim to unlock (1) discovery campaign efficiency gains from a low number of experiments / data points, (2) Explainable artificial intelligence models to quantitatively map formulation-function behavior, and (3) predictive tools to optimize and enable classically challenging drugs for at home pre-filled autoinjectors. Successful and efficient Phase I outcomes would immediately enable advanced bioformulation for critically important medicines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These polypeptides hold potential for wide-ranging applications such as biocompatible polymers, advanced medical therapeutics, and self-assembling materials, yet existing methods often demand specialized catalysts or extensive purification, which limits their application. By refining a process called ?helix-guided polymerization?, this project will enable more efficient and finely controlled synthesis, including robust beta-sheet-forming variants that expand the type of polypeptides that can be produced and broaden their applications. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in advanced polymer synthesis and computational modeling, gaining multidisciplinary expertise. To promote broader collaboration and accelerate discovery, the project team will provide an online platform for kinetic analysis and partner with high school enrichment programs, thereby engaging the next generation of learners in cutting-edge polymer research. Altogether, these efforts will lead to more sustainable and accessible methods for producing protein-like polymers, stimulating fresh ideas and solutions within macromolecular research and STEM education.<br/><br/>Technically, this research addresses major limitations in amino acid N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) polymerization, particularly sensitivity to impurities and limited control over beta-sheet formation, through an auto-accelerated ring-opening mechanism using a ?sergeants-and-soldiers? strategy. Here, alpha-helical macroinitiators act as ?sergeants? to guide the rapid and precise polymerization of beta-sheet-prone (and other) NCA ?soldier? monomers. The project will systematically expand helix-guided polymerization to a broader set of beta-sheet-forming NCAs, develop an enzyme-like kinetic model capable of predicting copolymerization outcomes (including potential off-pathway or inhibitory effects), and establish techniques for direct polymerization from non-purified NCAs. This comprehensive approach expands the scope of NCA-based syntheses, removing the need for rigorous purification and enabling large-scale, metal-free polypeptide production. Ultimately, advanced macromolecular/supramolecular design and robust kinetic analysis will deepen the fundamental understanding of auto-catalyzed NCA polymerization, facilitating the creation of functional biopolymers for diverse applications in macromolecular, supramolecular, and nanomaterials research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, traditional models using artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are static, monolithic, and optimized for worst-case scenarios, leading to significant computational demands that mobile devices often cannot meet. This technology provides operators with real-time, actionable insights, even in low-bandwidth environments. The solution is based on a new generation of AI algorithms, empowering systems with new analysis capabilities. In addition, it uses a modular approach that is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, which may ensure greater scalability and adaptability for rapidly evolving missions. The ability of the platform to deploy AI algorithms in a flexible, resilient, and distributed fashion may make it possible to gather information from multiple sources from the environment, understand what the information means, and use the information to predict what may happen next, referred to as dynamic situational awareness. This technology may improve the decision making and safety of first responders and workers across fields and commercial areas and improve U.S. defense capabilities.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a software platform to provide a wide range of computer vision tasks by leveraging adaptive sensor fusion and edge processing. Computer vision is the cornerstone of a broad range of current and future mobile applications, such as vehicular autonomy, robotics, and traffic monitoring. In this domain, deep neural networks (DNN) achieve the best performance, where many generations of models have been designed to accomplish various tasks. Currently, these algorithms are designed for execution on a single machine and are static and monolithic. One downside of this approach is that the algorithms are tuned to process the ?worst? case input, and have computational demands often failing to meet application requirements when considering the limitations of mobile devices. Moreover, offloading the execution to compute-capable devices (edge computing) requires the transfer of information-rich signals (e.g., camera, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and radar imaging) over capacity constrained and volatile wireless channels. The goal is to provide operators with real-time, actionable insights, even in low-bandwidth or contested environments. The ability of the platform to deploy AI algorithms in a flexible, resilient and distributed fashion may make it possible to provide dynamic situational awareness in a broad range of applications.

The theory of dynamical systems studies such movements by replacing the three-dimensional space with a finite two-dimensional slice. Though tremendously powerful, this technique has its limits. For instance, there is no finite, two-dimensional space that captures all of the original system?s dynamics. This project explores new ways of understanding low-dimensional dynamical systems that are inspired by the classical approach and seeks to unify major threads in the study of structures on three-dimensional spaces. In terms of broader impacts, the PI will continue to co-organize a regional seminar, mentor graduate students, and volunteer mathematics homework help and tutoring during the afterschool program at a local recreation center.  <br/><br/>The PI?s research divides into three interrelated themes. First, the PI will work on classifying all pseudo-Anosov flows that are transverse to a fixed taut foliation. His approach proceeds by first understanding the universal circles associated to such a foliation and builds on recent advances made in his joint work with Landry and Minsky. Second, the PI will connect the dynamics and topology of these flows and foliations with the hyperbolic geometry of the underlying three-manifold. In particular, the PI and his collaborators recently developed a new method to study endperiodic maps of infinite-type surfaces by producing a ?pseudo-Anosov?like? representative associated to the flow. The PI will exploit this new structure by studying the dynamics of the resulting maps and the hyperbolic geometry of their mapping tori. Third, the PI will extend these new techniques into the dynamical study of free-by-cyclic groups and toward the geometric study of mapping class groups. This includes answering long-standing algorithmic questions in mapping class groups and developing a new fixed-point theory of pseudo-Anosov maps, which itself has consequences for hyperbolic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to leverage FABRIC (https://portal.fabric-testbed.net), an NSF-funded national distributed computing/networking research infrastructure, to efficiently and securely train AI models and employ them to accelerate research and advance scientific discovery. <br/><br/>This project seeks to empower faculty and students with generative AI capabilities to foster innovations in computing and related scientific disciplines. The research activities will lead to the development of new algorithms and techniques for efficient, scalable, and secure language model (LM) pretraining and inference using FABRIC. Specifically, new approaches will be developed to enable (a) efficient LM training for heterogeneous graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters and high speed networking using model parallelism and network-aware cost models; (b) scalable and secure processing of LM training jobs using combinatorial optimization techniques while ensuring fair-share of cluster resources; and (c) efficient CPU-based LM inference using combinatorial optimization techniques to achieve high cluster utilization. A secure, end-to-end operational prototype will integrate the University of Missouri (MU) research computing with FABRIC. As a result, users can leverage FABRIC for LM training and inference on domain-specific datasets at no charge.<br/><br/>The proposed research will foster advances in applications of AI to disciplines such as health informatics, and bioinformatics.

This project aims to identify molecules that can be used to study one of the most basic mysteries about our universe: why it is composed of matter, rather than anti-matter. In particular, the PI and undergraduate students will use lasers to study the wavelengths of light absorbed by molecules containing copper, silver, and gold. They will then use state-of-the-art models to connect these measurements to information about fundamental particle physics. The work in this laboratory involves building laser and optical systems, designing electronics, and using specialized software to collect and analyze data. This work is located at a primarily undergraduate institution (Williams College) where students can become research partners from very early on in their education. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to contribute to the experimental work, building skills for academia and industry. Students will collaborate on presentations at conferences and journal publications. These students often go on to graduate school in physics, chemistry, engineering, or related fields.<br/> <br/>This research program will study molecules that can be prepared at ultracold temperatures for next-generation precision measurements of fundamental symmetry violation. Over the past several decades, precision spectroscopy of molecules has led to some of the strongest tests of theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Demand for molecules that enable increasingly sensitive measurements of fundamental symmetry violation has grown as these tests continue to search for ?new? physics at ever-higher energy scales. The PI and undergraduate students will apply the tools of optical control to new molecules that are poised to advance these questions by searching for symmetry-violating effects like the electron?s electric dipole moment and/or nuclear Schiff moments. A special focus will be placed on molecules containing coinage-metal atoms (copper, silver, and gold) bonded to lead atoms. These molecules appear especially promising because they appear to be extremely sensitive to the electron EDM, can be prepared and detected using laser light, and are relatively insensitive to external magnetic field fluctuations that often limit experimental precision. The PI and students will analyze the electronic, vibrational, rotational, and hyperfine (nuclear spin) structure of these molecules; identify methods to form the molecules at ultracold temperatures; and demonstrate laser-based control of the motion and quantum states of the molecules. Along the way, the PI and students will search for other metal-containing molecules that can be controlled with laser light, a long-standing goal for quantum information science more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's impact is to enable provably correct (correct by construction) code generation of key computational routines in a high-performance manner that can be incorporated into larger code bases. This contributes to the overall goal of whole-program verification of scientific applications. The project?s novelties are 1) new notations for describing operations involving structured matrices and tensors, 2) new insights to identify high-performance algorithms from their specification, and 3) integrating complex data movement into the specification of the algorithm to better identify and exploit optimization opportunities at various abstraction levels.

The study focuses on pecan trees (Carya illinoinensis), which represent a major socioeconomic driver of the US-Mexico binational region and are particularly vulnerable to water scarcity and declining water quality. The study examines how variations in leaf-level traits of trees growing on different soils influence their use of water and how those variations make them more or less susceptible to stress conditions from extremely hot and dry weather. By looking at the effect of weather extremes on the daily functioning of trees at the level of their leaves (how they change their transpiration and photosynthetic activities) together with historical analyses of tree growth variations from tree rings, the study looks to disentangle the impact of soil water availability and weather conditions on limiting the growth and productivity of these important crops. The knowledge generated through this project will enable farmers to better understand the water use patterns of these perennial crops as they respond to challenging weather conditions, potentially leading to enhanced management practices and increased resilience of agriculture in the U.S.-Mexico binational region. <br/><br/>This project employs a multi-temporal, multi-scale, and multidisciplinary approach, to identify tree responses to abiotic stressors, including soil moisture availability, temperature, and air dryness by integrating micrometeorology, dendrochronology, hydrology, plant physiology, plant genomics and hydrogeochemistry analyses. Additionally, through this project, a cohort of 24 undergraduate students (6 per year for 4 years) is being trained for periods of ten weeks during the height of the growing season. This training occurs in a multidisciplinary setting in one of the areas in North America experiencing severe water and heat stress and exposes the students to the cultural intricacies of binational water resources management. Non-NSF funded collaborators from foreign institutions are training, supervising and mentoring the cohort of U.S. students as well as facilitating the material resources needed to conduct their research while in Mexico.

These applications are powered by advances in hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning that are leading to a proliferation of new agent capabilities to sense their surroundings more accurately, see and understand the world better, navigate and maneuver with dexterity, and engage in complex reasoning. As AI continues to make rapid progress, these capabilities will also give rise to an increasing number of designs and functions of automated agents tailored to specific tasks. The expected increase in capabilities has the potential to enable automated agents to carry out highly complex tasks, significantly improving safety, reliability, and efficiency across various industries. However, one of the key challenges is ensuring that agents with different capabilities can work effectively as a team. Toward this objective, the project focuses on how to systematically characterize the capabilities of agents, assign tasks to a large team of agents with different capabilities, and what actions the agents should take so that the team completes the overall mission as safely and as efficiently as possible. For example, knowing how well delivery vehicles navigate a city during the day or at night and on large roads or narrow streets would allow users to anticipate the volume of deliveries the fleet can handle logistically and cost effectively. Formally, characterizing the capabilities of agents would allow effective matching of agents to tasks, efficient overall planning for teams of agents, and detection of problems during their deployment.<br/><br/>The project focuses on reasoning about the capabilities of agents with learning-based components and planning for teams of agents. It will enable the integration of automated agents into existing planning and decision-making frameworks that include both traditional and learning-based components. Approaches that rely exclusively on machine learning are prohibitively expensive since they require large amounts of data, time and energy to train, and are unsafe due to their opaque nature that precludes explanations of their behavior. This work addresses planning with learning-enabled agents by providing formal guarantees for the capabilities and performance of agents. Capabilities are determined by on-board hardware and software, while performance is dependent on the time, location and situation of deployment. Reasoning about agent capabilities enables the integration of learning-based and conventional planning components, provides guarantees and interpretability on agent behavior, and increases effective and efficient use of agents. The three main tasks of the project are developing: (1) A formal framework to describe, reason about and learn agents? capabilities and performance; (2) Planning methods for teams of agents that match agents to complex tasks based on temporal, spatial and semantic contexts; and (3) Mechanisms for the detection and recovery from failures during deployment stemming from errors in capturing capabilities and estimating their performance. Additionally, the educational activities will prepare students for careers in the interdisciplinary field of planning and decision-making for learning-enabled agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geometries arise naturally in many areas, including several complex variables (SCV), partial differential equations (PDE), and algebraic, complex, and differential geometry. This research project by the Principal Investigator is centered around a particular geometry - CR geometry - that arises in the study of SCV and complex geometry. It has deep and profound connections to central topics in mathematical and theoretical physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, as well as applications in systems engineering and control theory. The study of obstruction flatness, e.g., which has a prominent role in this project, has a direct link, via the Lorentzian Fefferman space, to the equations of motion in conformal gravity. The ideas and techniques that are needed for the investigations in this project come from a broad range of mathematical areas: complex analysis/geometry, PDE, and differential geometry; and, at the same time, the techniques and tools developed in this project will benefit these areas as well.  The project will also provide interesting research topics and learning experiences for graduate students and postdocs. The seminar activity that will result from the project should be inspiring and stimulating for both students and other researchers.<br/><br/>The goal of this mathematics research project is to study geometric and analytic aspects of invariant metrics and their potentials in complex analytic spaces, and related invariants in CR structures. The PI will investigate questions that are motivated by the classical and generalized Cheng-Yau and Ramadanov Conjectures concerning the Bergman metric and Bergman kernel, respectively, in strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex analytic spaces. He intends to work on the Cheng-Yau Conjecture for domains in Stein spaces with isolated singularities. The Ramadanov Conjecture, which asserts that strictly pseudoconvex domains with Bergman log flat boundaries are spherical, has been shown to fail in complex manifolds of dimension at least 3 (but holds true in dimension 2). This opens a compelling classification problem for domains with Bergman log flat boundaries that the PI intends to investigate. He also intends to study the asymptotic boundary behavior of invariant quantities such as the Bergman kernel, Bergman metric, and the Cheng-Yau solution to the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The investigations will elucidate how the boundary geometry influences analysis in complex spaces with boundaries. Additionally, the PI intends to pursue a theory for the Kohn Laplacian in domains on abstract CR manifolds. This is relevant to the local CR embedding problem in dimension 5. He also intends to continue his work on characterizing embeddability of compact CR 3-folds. The PI will investigate consequences of the global vanishing on a compact CR manifold of a higher order local invariant known as the obstruction function. This invariant is the obstruction to smooth extension to the boundary of the Cheng-Yau solution to the complex Monge-Ampere equation. In 3D, this invariant coincides with the trace at the boundary of the log-term in Fefferman's asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel and, hence, this problem is also connected with a strong form of the Ramadanov Conjecture. While the PI has made significant progress on the problem in 3D, it is still open in general. In higher dimensions, this problem is separate from the Ramadanov Conjecture, another problem that the PI intends to pursue. Additionally, he will investigate the relationship between the Bergman metric and the complete Kähler-Einstein metric in the setting of Stein spaces with singularities. A particular goal is to settle a generalized Cheng Conjecture in this context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These bacteria communicate with each other and with the host. Bacteria produce enclosed capsules, called vesicles, that shuttle information (DNA, protein, RNA) between cells and between the bacteria and the host. The communication can affect the types and relative numbers of bacteria present. They can affect the health of the host by stimulating or suppressing immune responses. They impact the local environment, which can also impact reproductive disease resistance, for example. This project is designed to understand bacterial signal production and transmission in a vaginal microbiome. How bacterial vesicles are produced will be investigated. How these capsules move through barriers such as mucus will be evaluated. How they affect the bacterial community composition, and ultimately, health, is of critical importance and will be studied. The project will also provide research experiences for local high school students and undergraduates.<br/><br/>This project is designed to advance understanding of how microbiomes contribute to health, with a specific focus on bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs). bEVs are a poorly understood mode of cross-kingdom cellular communication. As membrane-bound, nano-sized particles that transport proteins, small molecules, and nucleic acids, bEVs facilitate cellular communication both locally and at distant sites throughout a host. The model system to be studied is the vaginal microbiome. This project has three technical objectives.  The first is to characterize bEV biogenesis. The second is to evaluate how the mucus barrier impacts the fate of bEVs. The third is to determine how bEV function is affected in physiologically relevant environments. The proposed research will advance fundamental understanding of bEV loading and perturbations to bEV-based signaling in response to changes in the host environment. This work differs from current efforts as it examines bEV biogenesis, fate, and function in physiologically relevant model systems, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the role of bEVs in microbe-host communication. Microcalorimetry, transcriptomics, lipidomics, and proteomics will be used to map changes to bEV loading and production in response to environmental perturbations. Multi-particle tracking technology will quantify the transport of bEVs across mucus barriers. Finally, mucus-based models will probe microbe-host interactions in physiologically relevant systems. Knowledge gained from this research will generate new insights and provide a deeper understanding of bEVs that will prove useful for engineers, microbiologists, and health researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spectral analysis is crucial for scientific discovery and practical applications in various fields, including material manufacture, drug design, food safety, explosive detection, and non-invasive diagnosis. Spectral analysis offers rapid, sensitive, non-destructive, and cost-effective identification of unknown molecules through their characteristic numerical signals and outperforms traditional chemical analysis. However, the process of translating numerical signals into molecular structures is currently resource-intensive and not user-friendly because it often requires extensive trial-and-error and specialized training. This project aims to revolutionize spectral analysis using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) in an automatic, accelerated, and accurate fashion. This project will treat spectral signals and molecular structures as two different ""languages"". Models developed in this project will automatically transform spectral signals and molecular structures into descriptions of molecules in the two languages and enable rapid conversion between each description based on advanced AI-powered language translation tools. The resulting universal toolkit will simplify and streamline spectral analysis in practical scenarios and benefit applications in scientific research, national healthcare, national security, educational activities, and other domains. <br/><br/>The primary intellectual contribution of this project is the development of a novel chemistry-informed, multi-modal, powerful, and flexible deep learning framework to realize automatic, accelerated, and accurate end-to-end spectrum-to-structure translations. Investigators will adapt and leverage foundation models from the frontier of AI, especially pre-trained large language models (LLMs) like Transformers. This project will design an encoder-decoder architecture, where the spectrum encoder converts the input numerical spectral signals (e.g., wavenumber-absorbance pairs from infrared (IR) spectra and chemical shift-intensity pairs from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra) into context vectors, and the structure decoder transforms these context vectors into the output molecular fingerprint containing two-dimensional (2D) topological structures and three-dimensional (3D) spatial conformations of target molecules. The encoder and decoder will be pre-trained on high-quality data sets of molecular spectra from experimental measurements and theoretical calculations and fine-tuned to boost the performance. The project will accomplish three fundamental thrusts, including (a) developing natural-language representations for both spectral signals and molecular structures that align with the architecture of foundation models, (b) designing multi-modal learning frameworks to leverage pre-trained foundation models as the backbone approaches and inject chemical constraints as domain-specific knowledge for an end-to-end spectrum-to-structure translation, and (c) tailoring our multi-modal learning frameworks using chemistry- and data-informed schemes to adapt to the practical instrumental analysis pipeline for applications in real-life scenarios. This project will demonstrate significance across a broad range of disciplines where spectral analysis is essential for identifying or recognizing single molecules or molecular mixtures, including chemistry, biology, medicines, pharmacology, astronomy, security, materials science, food science, and environmental science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is an economically valuable product used in multiple industries including pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, paper, plastics, and building materials. SequestStar will support these industries by providing alternative sources for PCC. In addition, the SequestStar microalgae create compounds that are valuable for human health, enhancing the economic viability of the process and public well-being. This project also will contribute to national water security by using waste brine produced by desalination drinking water plants ? transforming the waste streams of these plants into a source of economically valuable products. Using SequestStar PCC in concrete for coral and oyster habitat restoration could provide new materials needed to help counteract ecosystem degradation and species extinction. <br/><br/>This Convergence Accelerator program will significantly advance the SequestStar technology down the path toward commercialization. The SequestStar process is inspired by whiting events in lakes during which precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) forms when the pH of the water rises in response to microalgal growth. By mimicking the geochemistry of whiting events using industrial bioreactors and brine from desalination plants, SequestStar will create PCC and microalgal products that support human health. Using solar energy to drive the process, the SequestStar technology will be designed so that these products are economically viable. As part of this effort, the SequestStar team will create an Input-to-Product pilot system, test industrial scale components, simultaneously optimize microalgal bioproducts and PCC production, conduct market research, and techno-economic analyses, and develop a Front-End Engineering Design of an industrial-scale facility. Advances in fundamental knowledge and innovations will occur related to photosynthetic carbon assimilation and geochemistry within high-pH fluids and control of calcium carbonate precipitation using brine.

Employers consistently rank teamwork as one of the most critical skills for engineering graduates; however, many new engineers feel unprepared to navigate interpersonal challenges in real-world projects. Despite widespread adoption of project-based learning (PBL) involving teamwork, instructional methods frequently emphasize evaluating final products rather than guiding the teamwork process itself, leaving students to learn vital teamwork skills through trial and error. Such limited guidance results in common challenges, including unequal participation, unresolved conflicts, and inadequate psychological safety?the belief that team members can safely take interpersonal risks without fear of negative consequences. These issues are particularly pronounced for first-year students, who often enter college with limited teamwork experience and find themselves poorly equipped to manage conflicts effectively. By investigating how students and faculty collaboratively shape psychological safety, manage conflicts, and adapt teamwork behaviors, this research aims to provide critical insights into fostering healthier, more productive team environments. The findings will directly support faculty in implementing effective instructional strategies, better preparing engineering graduates for collaborative workplaces. This work aligns closely with the National Science Foundation?s Research in the Formation of Engineers (RFE) program, advancing innovative teaching practices and developing essential professional competencies for engineers.<br/><br/>This project will utilize a multiple-case study design involving two distinct first-year engineering courses, one each at Virginia Tech and Rochester Institute of Technology. The research will address three primary questions: (1) How do students foster psychological safety, manage conflict, and regulate team performance in first-year engineering teams? (2) How do students' perceptions of psychological safety influence their conflict management strategies and teamwork regulation? (3) How do faculty instructional and assessment practices influence students' teamwork behaviors, psychological safety, and conflict management? Employing an adapted version of Rousseau et al.?s (2006) integrative framework of teamwork behaviors, the project will collect comprehensive data in the form of student interviews, focus groups, team communication artifacts, and instructional materials. Analysis will involve inductive thematic methods and deductive framework application to identify the connections between faculty practices and student teamwork behaviors. The intellectual merit of this research lies in advancing the understanding of teamwork processes and faculty roles in supporting the adaptation of teamwork. Specifically, it contributes new knowledge on the intersection of instructional practices and student teamwork regulation, with a particular emphasis on psychological safety?an area that has been extensively studied in organizational behavior but remains under-explored in engineering education contexts. Broader impacts include enhancing engineering instructional practices, specifically improving faculty readiness to teach and manage teamwork. Beyond publications, the findings of this work will also be disseminated through workshops, which will equip faculty with actionable strategies for supporting student teamwork across engineering curricula, from introductory courses to capstone projects, ultimately contributing to more supportive and professionally effective teamwork environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All this traffic is transported to users? devices through cell sites (base stations) from the cloud. In a traditional cellular network, both the radio head and the baseband processing unit are located together at the cell site. In future radio access networks (RANs), the radio unit (RU) is located at the cell site while the processing unit is located at the distributed/centralized unit (DU/CU), which could be located in a metropolitan area. Fronthaul is a critical component of radio access networks (RANs), supporting the data transport between the RU and the DU/CU over a fiber optic network. Current mobile fronthaul employs digital radio-over-fiber (DRoF) technology based on digital interfaces such as the enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI), which has a limited capacity and inefficient utilization of the underlying fiber networks. In contrast, analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF), which directly modulates radio frequency (RF) signals onto light for transmission over low-loss fibers at low latency, presents a promising approach for mobile fronthaul due to its high capacity and spectral efficiency, and the support of significantly simplified RU architecture. This project aims to enhance the efficiency and scalability of next-generation mobile networks by employing ARoF-based fronthaul. By moving away from the DRoF-based fronthaul approaches, ARoF-based fronthaul can facilitate more flexible network deployment, seamless integration with virtualized RANs, and efficient resource allocation across the wireless and optical domains.<br/><br/>The research tasks proposed in this project target the following scientific directions over three interrelated research thrusts: (i) Development of a unified framework for efficient transmission of multi-band and coherent RF signals over ARoF-based mobile fronthaul; (ii) Design of an efficient control architecture for reconfigurable mobile fronthaul networks supporting the coexistence of heterogeneous signals, incorporating dynamic resource allocation across the wireless and optical domains while ensuring seamless and adaptive network operations; (iii) Development of and experimentation with novel communication, spectrum sensing, and resource allocation paradigms that can be uniquely enabled by ARoF signals traversing the mobile fronthaul network.<br/><br/>This project plans to enhance the efficiency and scalability of next-generation mobile fronthaul. Specifically, this is expected to lead to expediting the adoption of ARoF technology in mobile networks and unleash the bandwidth capabilities of the fronthaul fiber, resulting in improved resource utilization in both the last-mile wireless access networks and the underlying fronthaul fiber infrastructure. By jointly optimizing the network performance across the wireless and optical domains, this project provides a meeting ground for wireless communication and optical networking research, and a platform to engage graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students in networking and communications research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These advances have been made possible in large part by the training of high-capacity models that are able to capture and infer complex relationships between exhorbitant amounts of data, such as images, video, and speech. Such training is quite resource-intensive and failure-prone and typically requires the deployment of large groups of computers that operate collaboratively to achieve the overall objectives. For instance, by conservative estimates, the training of current state-of-the-art models for language understanding consume enough energy to power over one thousand average US households for a year. Moreover, a rule-of-thumb within distributed computing states: ""failures are the norm, rather than the exception"". This project will investigate resource-efficient and fault-tolerant schemes for distributed model training within machine learning. Specifically, the training time depends on the reliability and speed of the computers and the speed of communication between them. This project will examine techniques for simultaneously increasing both the reliability and speed of the process. If successful, this will result in significant energy and monetary savings across the board in scenarios where machine learning is routinely deployed. The ability to work with large-scale computing clusters is an essential skill for the workforce, and this project will help train undergraduate and graduate students in such techniques. The team of researchers will volunteer for mathematics tutoring activities as part of the CyMath initiative at Iowa State; CyMath offers free and open-to-all, after-school math tutoring for elementary and middle school students in Ames area schools.  Overall, the goals of this project will lead to the acceleration of corresponding machine learning driven advances in a variety of fields, e.g., science and human health, and contribute towards the US economy and society.<br/><br/>Distributed machine learning model training typically involves minimizing a loss function that depends on the training dataset with respect to a parameter vector. The number of parameters in many problems of real-life interest can range from hundreds of millions to billions. Such training is the driver of key technologies such as deep neural networks and large language models. In these systems, the workers are required to compute gradients on the data points assigned to them. Depending on the underlying architecture, the workers either communicate to-and-from a central server or exchange messages amongst themselves to perform gradient descent over several iterations. In addition to worker-node computation, communication is well recognized as being a significant part of the overall training time. It is well recognized that worker nodes (especially within cloud platforms) are prone to straggling (slow-downs and/or failures). The foundational goal of this project is to investigate failure/slowdown-resilient and communication-efficient schemes for distributed model-training for different classes of learning architectures. This will be achieved by introducing redundancy in the assignment of data points to the worker nodes and using coding-theoretic ideas for the recovery of the gradient, either exactly or approximately. The research team will examine the design of numerically stable and communication-efficient schemes that leverage the work performed by slow (as against failed) workers. They will also research classes of schemes that vary depending on the amount of system knowledge across the workers and the assumed communication between them. A key goal will be to provide rigorous guarantees of the quality of the gradient that is recovered by the system. The successful completion of the goals of this project will result in significant reductions in training times of distributed models and corresponding resource savings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional shapes or spaces, examples of which are the surrounding physical space and space-time respectively. Surprisingly, these dimensions are substantially less understood than higher dimensions. In the past forty years, significant progress on central topological questions relating to three- and four-dimensional spaces has been made using invariants from gauge theory, which deals with solutions to sets of partial differential equations from physics, and Floer theory, which arises from the mathematical generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics. This project uses tools from Floer theory to study certain algebraic structures on the set of three-dimensional spaces, and to address other topological questions, many of which concern mathematical knots, which are closely connected to three-dimensional spaces. A particular focus of the project is on understanding and applying versions of Floer theory which incorporate the information of a symmetry, such as a reflection or a rotation, that a space may exhibit. In addition to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring efforts. These plans include mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, conducting summer research with undergraduate students, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and supervising student-led K-12 events at Rutgers.<br/> <br/>Building on their prior work, the PI and coauthors will explore the longstanding open question of the existence of torsion in the integer homology cobordism group, as well as give a full equivariant surgery formula for Heegaard Floer homology with respect to extrinsic symmetries of knots and links and use it to study the equivariant homology cobordism group of three-manifolds with orientation-preserving involutions. In another direction, the PI and coauthors will study symplectic Khovanov homology, and in particular show that their recent construction of an annular symplectic Khovanov homology agrees with combinatorial annular Khovanov homology and extend their formulation to a full symplectic APS homology. Finally, the PI and coauthors will study groups actions on symplectic Khovanov-Rozansky homology, giving a geometric interpretation of spectral sequences between the theory for different integers n which are understood algebraically.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Li of Purdue University will study the defect chemistry of two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) materials. TMDs are unique materials because they can exist stably as a single layer of atoms, which is the thinnest possible form of matter. They can exhibit a broad range of electronic properties depending on the composition and phase of the TMD and can consequently serve as electronic conductors, semiconductors, light absorbers, or catalysts. In addition, the ultra-thin nature of these materials makes their properties highly sensitive to defects on the surface. Under this award, Professor Li?s team will develop strategies to create defects on TMD surfaces in a controlled fashion and to utilize the defects for subsequent functionalization of TMDs to modulate their properties. Understanding the surface chemistry of these ultra-thin materials will guide the development of more efficient electronic and catalytic materials and will have important broader impacts on next-generation semiconductor and energy storage devices. In addition, the team will develop educational demonstrations based on these concepts targeted at K-12 students across Indiana, showcasing energy storage devices and batteries.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Li's team will study defect-mediated surface functionalization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials. The first goal will be to develop chemical activation strategies to controllably generate specific defect types on the surface of TMDs by utilizing chemical reagents that have strongly nucleophilic, reducing, or basic properties. The characterization methods necessary to study defect density and structure will be developed simultaneously, focusing on reactive titration methods, electronic and vibrational spectroscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Each defect type can subsequently be functionalized with a specific dopant class. In this study, the team will focus on the interaction between chalcogenide vacancies and anionic metal chalcogenide complexes to generate bilayer or multilayer heterostructures. The catalytic and electronic properties of functionalized TMDs will be studied to understand how defect and dopant structure influence TMD band structure and surface chemistry. Finally, the generality of the defect generation and characterization methods will be assessed for a wide range of TMD compositions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, climate change is now disrupting the evolved fit between organisms and their environments, leading to population declines. Natural areas loved by people and required by native species are being drastically and rapidly changed as key species are lost. But, if there is genetic variation in the ability to survive and reproduce in a changing climate, then evolution may lift population growth enough to enable population persistence. This study will provide policy makers and conservation managers guidelines to evaluate the potential efficacy of such evolutionary rescue. The PIs will measure population growth rates and the speed of evolutionary response of Scarlet Monkeyflower to the major, multi-year drought that took place between 2011-2016 in the western United States. This project will also provide training in ecological, evolutionary, and statistical concepts and approaches for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, including those from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Although adaptation by natural selection and population trends (demography) are typically studied separately by evolutionary biologists and ecologists, respectively, they are fundamentally connected by fitness. In declining populations, individual fitness is generally low and individuals do not replace themselves. However, heritable variation for critical traits can allow adaptive evolution, boost fitness, and lead to increased population growth rate. An important question is whether adaptation to changing climate will be faster than the rate of demographic decline. This study will use reciprocal transplant and resurrection studies spanning the native range of the Scarlet Monkeyflower (Mimulus cardinalis) in Oregon and California to evaluate natural selection during the 2011-2016 mega-drought.

Stable isotopes are stable atoms of elements with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei; their small differences in mass lead to sorting during chemical reactions, such that stable isotopes act as natural tracers during a host of natural processes. The measurement of the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen provide insight into the behaviors of these elements in different chemical reactions in the environment. This includes tracking the movement of water, the migration of animals, and the transfer of energy in food networks. Stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses can also aid in reconstructing past changes in temperature and precipitation and understanding the formation of mineral deposits. Beyond research activities, the new instruments will also be used in teaching and outreach activities that will engage high school and college students and researchers both regionally and nationally.<br/><br/>These instruments will significantly enhance the capabilities of the VT Biogeochemistry Lab and expand its research, education, and outreach activities. It will be critical to on-going, currently funded and future research in the laboratory. Ongoing projects include measuring oxygen isotopes in sulfate to track aspects of the sulfur cycle and measuring hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in bat guano and fossil tooth enamel to evaluate changes in past atmospheric precipitation. Potential future projects with researchers at VT include employing hydrogen and oxygen isotopes to estimate trophic transfer efficiency in aquatic food networks, track bat migration, and reconstruct past temperatures using phosphate minerals.

Many industries such as technology, finance, and healthcare, rely on knowledge workers to extract insights from vast amounts of unstructured information, including documents, emails, and reports. However, existing AI solutions often produce unreliable or inconsistent results, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes environments. This project introduces a hybrid approach that combines structured algorithmic workflows with advanced AI models, ensuring complex multi-step tasks are completed with high accuracy, transparency, and explainability. Initially targeting enterprise sales, where data-driven insights fuel revenue growth, this innovation will assist in researching customers, uncovering new opportunities, and streamlining deal-making processes. The technology provides a durable competitive advantage by providing enterprise level automations with high reliability and transparency, allowing businesses to trust and integrate AI in their processes. As a key enabler of commercial success, it positions the company as a leader in enterprise AI. By year three, this technology is projected to impact over one million knowledge workers and drive measurable gains in productivity and revenue generation.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel AI framework that integrates algorithm design (logical reasoning) with machine learning models to enhance the analysis of unstructured data. Unlike conventional AI approaches that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), this framework structures AI workflows as step-by-step processes, selectively incorporating models like LLMs where appropriate to ensure transparency, consistency, and accuracy. The research will investigate key questions, including: Can a structured, logic driven AI system outperform end-to-end LLM-based methods in precision and recall?

However, hydrogen is difficult to store and transport. Ammonia has the chemical formula NH3, and is more convenient to store and transport. Accordingly there is great interest in temporarily converting hydrogen into ammonia, and then decomposing ammonia to recover hydrogen as a fuel. This project develops a membrane-based process for recovering hydrogen from ammonia. It combines the ammonia decomposition reaction, and the subsequent separation of hydrogen from ammonia and nitrogen, into a single operation. The process does not use expensive rare metals as catalysts. It is expected to be more energy-efficient compared with existing processes. The project benefits society by diversifying energy sources. Additional benefits to national interests come from training students in energy technology, outreach programs to engage pre-college students in STEM fields, and strengthening partnerships with industry. <br/><br/>This project uses a mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) membrane with catalyst to convert ammonia and steam at the two sides of the membrane. The overall reaction is the redox-driven decomposition of ammonia. Oxygen permeability and long term durability of the membrane are critical for this technology. The overall research objective is to tune the kinetics and stability of the oxygen-permeable membrane-catalyst system. This will enable ammonia conversion to exceed its single-step decomposition limit and prevent formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx compounds).  The project elucidates the coupled mass transport, charge transfer, and chemical kinetics occurring at membrane surface and interfaces. First, kinetic parameters of NH3 conversion and oxygen permeation will be analyzed to elucidate the reaction kinetics model for the proposed membrane-catalyst system. Next, the fundamental mechanisms influencing bulk and surface properties of the membrane-catalyst system will be investigated. For bulk properties, grain boundary chemistry, cation site distribution, and microstructural uniformity and defects will be characterized to discover their relationship with membrane bulk diffusion and stability. For surface properties, chemical bonding, redox state, and secondary phase(s) of catalyst and membrane will be correlated with surface kinetics and stability. Finally, the materials and system knowledge will be combined to construct a model that achieves ammonia conversion above the single-step NH3 decomposition limit and avoids NOx formation. Furthermore, the findings will extend beyond ammonia decomposition to inform other membrane-catalyst systems such as hydrocarbon reforming. Education and outreach activities in the project will include hands-on experiments, field visits, course development, and fireside chats to increase student and public interest in energy technologies and STEM careers, and to facilitate exchange between the students and industrial employers about career opportunities in energy fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wastewater treatment is an energy-intensive process, and biogas produced through anaerobic digestion is often flared but can be used to provide demand response by reducing or shifting the energy consumption of wastewater treatment plants. This project focuses on the key challenges of managing uncertainties within and the variability across treatment plants and demand response programs. The project will bring transformative change by providing wastewater treatment operators with optimal demand response strategies. Increasing demand flexibility will improve power grid reliability, particularly during periods of network stress. This will be achieved by developing an approach for characterizing the uncertainty in wastewater treatment and introducing novel optimization techniques to manage these uncertainties within a demand response scheduling optimization framework. The intellectual merits of the project include the development of new demand response strategies under uncertainty and quantifying the trade-offs between cost and feasibility for using biogas within wastewater treatment plants to provide demand response. The broader impacts of the project include reducing costs in both the electrical energy and wastewater sectors by demonstrating and applying effective strategies for using biogas. Collaboration with utilities and water quality researchers throughout the project will support the adoption of these strategies by improving stakeholder understanding of demand response program requirements, financial incentives, and operational impacts. This project will also integrate findings into new curriculum materials on industrial and utility-scale demand response and provide research experiences for graduate and undergraduate engineering students. <br/>This project is structured into two main tasks. The first task will develop system models to accurately capture the necessary timescales, uncertainty, and performance of biogas production and demand response programs. Using utility data, data-driven uncertainty sets will be constructed and refined to maintain robustness but avoid excessively conservative solutions. The second task will focus on solving for optimal demand response strategies for biogas use under uncertainty and evaluating trade-offs in providing demand response in terms of costs and feasibility. Together, these tasks will enable an estimate of the economic flexibility potential of biogas generators for demand response within the United States. Utility data will be leveraged from both small and large wastewater treatment plants to evaluate the proposed approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Employers consistently rank teamwork as one of the most critical skills for engineering graduates; however, many new engineers feel unprepared to navigate interpersonal challenges in real-world projects. Despite widespread adoption of project-based learning (PBL) involving teamwork, instructional methods frequently emphasize evaluating final products rather than guiding the teamwork process itself, leaving students to learn vital teamwork skills through trial and error. Such limited guidance results in common challenges, including unequal participation, unresolved conflicts, and inadequate psychological safety?the belief that team members can safely take interpersonal risks without fear of negative consequences. These issues are particularly pronounced for first-year students, who often enter college with limited teamwork experience and find themselves poorly equipped to manage conflicts effectively. By investigating how students and faculty collaboratively shape psychological safety, manage conflicts, and adapt teamwork behaviors, this research aims to provide critical insights into fostering healthier, more productive team environments. The findings will directly support faculty in implementing effective instructional strategies, better preparing engineering graduates for collaborative workplaces. This work aligns closely with the National Science Foundation?s Research in the Formation of Engineers (RFE) program, advancing innovative teaching practices and developing essential professional competencies for engineers.<br/><br/>This project will utilize a multiple-case study design involving two distinct first-year engineering courses, one each at Virginia Tech and Rochester Institute of Technology. The research will address three primary questions: (1) How do students foster psychological safety, manage conflict, and regulate team performance in first-year engineering teams? (2) How do students' perceptions of psychological safety influence their conflict management strategies and teamwork regulation? (3) How do faculty instructional and assessment practices influence students' teamwork behaviors, psychological safety, and conflict management? Employing an adapted version of Rousseau et al.?s (2006) integrative framework of teamwork behaviors, the project will collect comprehensive data in the form of student interviews, focus groups, team communication artifacts, and instructional materials. Analysis will involve inductive thematic methods and deductive framework application to identify the connections between faculty practices and student teamwork behaviors. The intellectual merit of this research lies in advancing the understanding of teamwork processes and faculty roles in supporting the adaptation of teamwork. Specifically, it contributes new knowledge on the intersection of instructional practices and student teamwork regulation, with a particular emphasis on psychological safety?an area that has been extensively studied in organizational behavior but remains under-explored in engineering education contexts. Broader impacts include enhancing engineering instructional practices, specifically improving faculty readiness to teach and manage teamwork. Beyond publications, the findings of this work will also be disseminated through workshops, which will equip faculty with actionable strategies for supporting student teamwork across engineering curricula, from introductory courses to capstone projects, ultimately contributing to more supportive and professionally effective teamwork environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve these goals, the program will use world-leading electron-scattering facilities at Jefferson Lab (JLab) in Virginia.  By combining the excitement of cutting-edge discovery science with a direct path to applications in energy, medicine, and defense, this program also contributes to recruitment of the next generation into STEM and workforce development that can directly affect the economy and everyday lives.<br/><br/>The program will focus on the study of exclusive lepton-antilepton production using the framework of generalized parton distributions. Here, Compton scattering is sensitive to the distribution of quarks while quarkonium (e.g., J/psi) production is sensitive to gluons ? the force carriers of the strong interaction. The PI and the postdoc will complete the analysis of the first-ever measurement of time-like Compton scattering on the proton (JLab experiment E12-12-001), and prepare for measurements of such processes at the EIC, providing essential input for future detector development. The PI and the graduate student will use JLab data to establish the feasibility of a similar measurement on the neutron, which would provide complementary information. If the results are promising, the analysis will lead to the first-ever publication on this process. The PI and the undergraduate students will carry out a series of projects aimed at the study of J/psi production on protons and nuclei at the EIC, which will for the first time make it possible to directly map out the gluon field. Measuring both Compton scattering and J/psi production will make it possible to compare the distributions of quarks and gluons (matter and force), while a comparison of J/psi production on the free and bound proton, as well as a nucleus as a whole, can tell us how the strong interaction is modified inside a nucleus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As electronic devices are made smaller, removing heat becomes a bigger challenge for designers. A microchannel heat sink is a small device containing many narrow tunnels that can be used to remove heat. Cooling liquid flows through the tunnels and efficiently carries away heat from hot electronic parts. Microchannel heat sinks are especially promising because they have a lot of surface area in a small space. Furthermore, they can use two-phase boiling inside the microchannels to increase the rate of heat removal, as it takes a lot of heat to boil the cooling liquid. However, adopting two-phase boiling in microchannel heat sinks has proven difficult because vapor bubbles that form during boiling can disrupt flow through the microchannels.  To address this issue, the team will use both computational and experimental models to understand how flow is disrupted and use the results to design methods to suppress the disruptions.  The results from the project will benefit myriad applications, including electric vehicle batteries, power systems, and space thermal control systems.  The project will also provide STEM outreach, improved heat transfer courses, and hands-on undergraduate research experiences at a primarily undergraduate institution.<br/><br/>A major challenge for microchannel heat sink boiling is instability due to vapor bubble reversal, which leads to pressure and temperature oscillation. The project will suppress flow boiling instability in a diverging counterflow microchannel heat sink by removing the vapor bubbles along the flow direction using secondary flow through interconnectors. It is hypothesized that the pressure distribution along the flow direction will induce secondary flow in a diverging microchannel heat sink, facilitating the collapse of any trapped elongated vapor bubbles. As a result of vapor bubble clearing, the heated surface will be prevented from dry-out and operate at higher heat flux. The project?s numerical task includes developing a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model that will provide a detailed understanding of secondary flow controls through interconnectors and bubble dynamics of flow boiling by pressure, temperature, and flow contour. The experimental framework will consist of a flow loop, a test section, a power supply system, and a data acquisition system, and the parameters tested will include critical heat flux, surface superheat, pressure drop, and boiling images. A high-speed camera will be used for flow visualization and will provide details of bubble dynamics and secondary flow behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dendritic cells are important because they can initiate the body?s defense against infections and prevent autoimmunity, which is when the body mistakenly attacks its own healthy organs and tissues. Dendritic cells could be a target for new therapeutics, but it is very difficult to accurately control them. The goal of this project is to produce synthetic antigen-presenting cells (SAPCs) that recreate the activities of natural dendritic cells. Using new tools in nanotechnology and bioengineering, the project will develop SAPCs that can present antigens to other immune cells to improve the immune response to the antigens. This work will provide new knowledge on how the size of SAPCs affects their function and will explore engineering strategies to develop size-changing SAPCs for optimal immune stimulation. The project will also have significant educational and societal influence. The research activities will be incorporated into existing summer programs at the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering that will provide direct research experience to high school and undergraduate students and provide graduate students with excellent opportunities to develop their research skills and contribute to groundbreaking discoveries.<br/><br/>Dendritic cells play a critical role in balancing immune activation and suppression, thereby making them valuable candidates for adoptive cell therapy in various medical conditions. However, their clinical use is limited by their sensitivity to the changes in the microenvironment and their association with adverse events. This research project will address these challenges by developing synthetic antigen-presenting cells (SAPCs) that precisely control the immune response. SAPCs are bioengineered constructs that retain only the essential functional molecules necessary for effective T cell priming and activation. The proposed work aims to elucidate how the size of SAPCs influences their function, with the goal to develop and evaluate size-tunable SAPCs that enhance T cell activation and adaptive immune response for immunotherapeutic applications. The approach integrates biological membrane extrusion with bioorthogonal click chemistry to fabricate SAPC constructs with adaptive size control, which enables a systematic investigation of how physical properties affect immune response. The research is organized into three primary aims. Aim 1 will focus on elucidating the impact of SAPC sizes on T cell activation, aim 2 is designed to develop size-changing SAPCs for enhanced immune stimulation following efficient tissue penetration, and aim 3 will validate the T cell stimulation efficacy of both static-size and size-changing SAPCs. This work is significant in advancing the fundamental understanding of how physical properties regulate immune responses and in driving engineering innovations toward scalable, size-tunable immunotherapeutic platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The other is the study of L-functions, which are powerful tools to count particular types of numbers, including prime numbers.

Probabilistic models allow mathematicians to develop models that predict the properties a mathematical object will likely have, even when it is not possible to know with certainty what properties it has. Another approach is by multiple Dirichlet series, which mathematicians create by modifying a number-theoretic problem until its solution is as symmetrical as possible, and then use these symmetries to find a solution to the original problem. The Principal Investigator will develop new probabilistic models and new multiple Dirichlet series, and use them to make progress on fundamental number-theoretic problems. Furthermore, the project also develops connections with other areas of mathematics - the Principal Investigator's work on probabilistic models will lead to new results in probability theory, while the work on multiple Dirichlet series will demonstrate connections between these series, topology, and quantum algebra, leading to new results in those areas. The Principal Investigator will also train future mathematicians. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator and collaborators will work in several interrelated directions. One will construct new multiple Dirichlet series, with clear potential applications to moments of L-functions, by a novel unifying perspective on multiple Dirichlet series. The second will construct probabilistic models for the Galois group of the maximal unramified extension of a random number field, and then probabilistic models for the entire absolute Galois group. The third will give probabilistic models for statistics of L-functions that fit them more closely than the previously considered probabilistic models. The probabilistic perspective will also lead to new evaluations of moments of L-functions, by better understanding the main term in problems where separating the main term from the error term is difficult.

Currently, semiconductor manufacturing research requires human operators to perform tasks, both in the lab and at the factory. Adding to the problem with chip manufacturing, defect formation in some types of semiconductor chips can ruin their performance, but defects can typically be detected only after the process has been completed. At that point, the chip must be scrapped or repurposed. This problem is especially challenging with promising materials such as diamond, which could transform power transmission and other advanced applications due to its unparalleled thermal and electrical properties. This research endeavors to use AI monitoring together with innovative defect detection and process analysis to automate these processes. This work could lead to an entirely automated cybermanufacturing approach to semiconductor chips, using diamond as the flagship material. The work also includes objectives to assist the existing and future manufacturing workforce to understand, learn, and adapt to AI processes, so as to translate existing jobs into next-generation Industry 4.0 careers. The research will be integrated into a forward-thinking training program in semiconductor manufacturing for graduate students and senior-level undergraduates at MSU and local community colleges, as well as events and opportunities for the existing manufacturing workforce in Michigan. This work?s impact extends beyond chip manufacturing into sectors such as energy, electronics, healthcare monitoring, and defense.<br/><br/>Manufacturing ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) single crystals requires a leap in scientific understanding, because growing these crystals with sufficiently high quality for power electronics is at a plateau of development for some of the most promising materials -- namely diamond and aluminum nitride (AlN). This work addresses several of the major scientific and technical challenges associated with building a full understanding of single crystal epitaxial growth of diamond and other UWBG materials. First, the proposed work combines in-situ hyperspectral and infrared spectroscopic imaging, ex-situ and comprehensive 3D material characterization, and physics modeling of microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (MPACVD) diamond growth to map between reactor telemetry, process, and resulting crystal quality. This creates an industry-accessible diagnostic solution to understanding the processes in a sealed reactor environment. Second, incorporation of this diagnostic data into a deep learning ? based AI model will allow fundamental research into how to accommodate the vast variability and rapidly shifting spatial and temporal aspects of crystal growth. Third, the work will include research on strategies to improve the robustness of the AI model in the materials science context, which is a novel endeavor. Finally, the work will uncover key findings related to translation of the AI model for diamond growth to other epitaxial crystal manufacturing systems, namely for AlN. Beyond these technical objectives, the research will address education and workforce development via a robust plan that incorporates outreach, curricular updates, and training across a spectrum of participation levels from students through existing professionals.

Traditional radiation-hardened techniques that address this challenge are both costly and based on outdated technology, limiting performance and flexibility. At the same time, renewed interest in lunar and Martian exploration is driving demand for far more capable space-based computing. Fortunately, a promising approach called in-memory processing is being explored where memory directly performs computation. Using this method, memory can function like an accelerator suitable for enabling state-of-the-art image and signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that would be otherwise impractical.  Memory-based acceleration reduces the burden on and complements central processors for space computing systems. The RADIANT project investigates whether modern commercial memory devices, not originally designed for space, can function reliably and provide in-memory processing capabilities in radiation-rich environments through appropriately-designed error correction techniques. The research supports national priorities by advancing space computing capabilities, while also offering interdisciplinary education opportunities that span computer science, engineering, and physics.<br/><br/>RADIANT has two main technical goals. First, it characterizes the behavior of commercial dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the dominant technology for main memory in modern computers, under space-like conditions. The behavior of commercial DRAM in environments with elevated radiation and temperature shifts still remains relatively poorly understood. The study examines DRAM during both conventional use and in-memory processing to identify common fault modes and their dependence on memory architecture and access patterns. Second, the project develops fault tolerance techniques to protect DRAM for in-memory computing, which introduces unique challenges not addressed by traditional error correction methods. These include developing novel error correction codes that work for in-memory processing operations, as well as memory mapping strategies that account for weak or failure-prone regions. Together, these efforts aim to make advanced, low-cost memory technologies both viable and substantially more capable.  RADIANT can provide the fundamental capabilities to allow supporting tensor-based algorithms, including the latest AI approaches such as large language and foundation models, in future space missions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to utilize a combination of quantitative live-cell imaging, quantitative proteomics, and functional genetics to investigate how plant cells couple exocytosis and endocytosis to regulate the abundance of cellulose synthase at the plasma membrane?a process that remains largely unexplored. These findings will enhance knowledge of both cell wall biosynthesis and the mechanisms underlying plant cell growth. Furthermore, the project will create research opportunities for undergraduate students. By tailoring research projects to various undergraduate research programs, this initiative will attract talented students and prepare them for graduate education and academic careers. Additionally, the project will include a hands-on research workshop for local high school students and their teachers at Pennsylvania State University, aiming to inspire interest in the biological sciences.<br/><br/>The ability to produce renewable energy is crucial for both the economy and the environment, with cellulosic biomass expected to be a key source for biofuel production. Cellulose microfibrils are synthesized at the plasma membrane by a protein complex known as the cellulose synthase complex (CSC), which converts sugar molecules into energy-rich crystalline cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Since cellulose synthesis occurs exclusively at the plasma membrane, understanding how CSCs are trafficked to the cell surface is essential. The abundance of CSC at the plasma membrane is tightly regulated. Cellulose synthase proteins can remain stable for over 48 hours in vivo, and their regulation relies on exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling, rather than protein turnover. Unlike mammalian and yeast systems, where exocytosis and endocytosis are well-studied, cellulose synthase represents a plant-specific cargo protein, making it a unique subject of investigation. The principal investigator?s pioneering work includes developing advanced in vivo imaging techniques and genetic tools tailored for analyzing cellulose synthase trafficking. This proposal employs interdisciplinary approaches?quantitative proteomics, live-cell imaging, genome editing, and machine learning?to investigate how various trafficking components coordinate with exocytosis and endocytosis machinery to maintain steady CSC levels at the plasma membrane in a microtubule-dependent manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For children coming of age in families where the language spoken at home differs from the language of the larger community, exposure to two languages typically produces bilingualism. Using a home language different than the language spoken outside by the larger society, called heritage bilingualism, is the most common form of bilingualism in this country although it has not been an area of much investigation. A feature of heritage bilingualism is that children in this context are often called upon to translate for their caregivers. The stronger language skills that the children in these contexts come to have, particularly once they enter school, enable them to become brokers or translators for their caregivers, who may only speak the home language or may have only partial knowledge of the language of wider communication. Language brokering may involve translating conversations, documents, and providing language support in medical settings. <br/><br/>The focus of the research in the current project is on the consequences of this translation or brokering experience once these children become young adults. The researchers hypothesize that the highly dynamic use of both languages required to broker will be associated not only with more integrated language representations but also with a greater ability to regulate the effective use of the two languages under a range of communicative contexts. The team takes a novel approach by analyzing young adult bilinguals? brain and behavior to examine the impact of language brokering on language processing and cognition. They ask whether this early life experience of intensive translation creates enduring consequences for young adult bilinguals. Outcomes of this study bring awareness to the cognitive affects of language brokering, thus contributing to demystifying views of bilingualism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their design introduces unprecedented challenges in ensuring performance, safety, and human alignment due to a broad range of risks. First, existing techniques in risk quantification and control often assume observable state, system dynamics, and in-distribution data with sufficient risk events. However, these assumptions frequently break down in real-world scenarios. Second, inferring and reducing human-perceived risk requires characterizing safe actions from sparse feedback, but existing techniques often cannot handle this complexity. Finally, in nonstationary interactions, control methods that ignore the opponents? adaptation can unintentionally encourage aggressive or exploitative behaviors by humans. In this proposal, we study how to provide long-term, lifelong assurances against various risks in the control of autonomous systems operating in uncertain and interactive environments. The outcome of this research will be broadly disseminated through seminars and tutorials and integrated into the PI?s classes and K-12 outreach programs. To enrich the learning experience, we will create a virtual game that allows students to understand key concepts through interacting with others. These efforts will train future researchers and engineers, and facilitate the transfer of insights across domains.<br/> <br/>The goal of this proposal is to develop techniques that mitigate various risks?visible or latent, actual or perceived?across single and repeated interactions. In Thrust 1, we quantify long-term risks despite latent variables and limited data. In Thrust 2, we develop efficient control techniques that provide long-term assurance against latent and human-perceived risks. One of our core innovations is probabilistic invariance, which flexibly handles unknowns, improves assurance time horizon vs. computation tradeoffs, and allows many risk inference methods to be leveraged in real-time control. In Thrust 3, we study the designs that avoid adverse adaptation or facilitate desirable behaviors in nonstationary interactions. Thrusts 1 and 2 will offer complementary insights into how short-term observations can be used to infer long-term risk and how controllers with short planning horizons can mitigate long-term risks. Thrusts 1-3 will provide a unified perspective across two pairs of topics that are often studied separately?control within a single interaction vs. adaptation across repeated interactions and alignment vs. deliberate misalignment. This unified perspective will enable us to proactively harness uncertainty, adaptation, and (mis)alignment to design safer, high-performing, and more human-aligned autonomous control systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cryptographic protocols such as secure multiparty computation (MPC) enable collaborative data science on private datasets for richer scientific discovery, especially in fields with downstream societal relevance such as genomics. MPC, however, incurs non-trivial computational overhead; so, in the face of increasing cloud computing costs, data scientists are disincentivized from adopting MPC. The objective of this project is to advance knowledge in private, collaborative computation by developing techniques that reduce the cost of practical MPC for data science in the cloud. The project's novelties are providing valuable insights into the real-world characteristics of private computation on data science tasks and instantiating the first cost-efficient protocol for cloud MPC. The project's broader significance and importance are minimizing the costs of generating the transformative scientific insights enabled by private, collaborative data science, thereby making judicious use of limited resources to achieve the greatest impact.<br/><br/>The project builds MPC on top of spot instances, which are heavily discounted cloud instances with the caveat that they can be revoked (or shut down) at any time. The project studies how dynamic MPC -- a theoretical primitive that allows computing nodes to enter and exit during MPC -- can be deployed to handle this revocation. The project provides the first comprehensive analysis of dynamic MPC in practice, evaluating these protocols on representative data science workloads. Then, it applies these experimental insights to develop the first MPC system specifically tailored for spot instances, adapting dynamic MPC techniques to continue computation even when spot nodes are revoked. By building MPC on top of spot instances, the project lays the foundation for an open-source, cost-efficient platform for large-scale data science over sensitive datasets, which will empower greater scientific discovery without compromising privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chronic rhinosinusitis affects 40 million U.S. adults and causes persistent nasal congestion, facial pain, mucus overproduction, headaches, and poor sleep. Existing pharmaceutical treatments rely on nasal sprays and other anti-inflammatory drugs but fail to provide relief in around 50% of patients. When medications fail, some patients may qualify for invasive and costly surgery. However, symptom recurrence after surgery is common, leaving millions of patients without an effective solution to get symptom relief. This project addresses this gap in care by exploring an alternative method that targets the nasal nerve pathways shown to contribute to excessive mucus production and inflammation. The goal is to offer a drug-free, effective, and accessible approach to improve daily functioning, sleep, and quality of life. By reducing dependence on costly medications and surgical procedures, this technology has the potential to save up to $1 billion annually on healthcare costs, improve productivity, and reduce the burden of chronic sinus disease on patients, families, and the healthcare system. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

Unlike existing therapies that rely on immune suppression or invasive procedures, this approach is the first to address the neurological component of chronic sinus disease using a non-invasive, drug-free method. The device is a custom-fitted mouthguard that delivers gentle electrical pulses to the nasal cavity. This neuromodulation technology was validated in a successful animal model, showing significant decongestion and improved nasal airflow. Following successful preclinical validation, the device is undergoing human testing.

These infections cost healthcare systems billions of dollars annually in revision surgeries and related treatments. Current antimicrobial strategies focus primarily on killing bacteria but often overlook the role of the body?s immune system, which plays a crucial role in infection control. Upon implantation, biomaterials can disrupt the immune system, causing excessive inflammation and increasing infection risks. This CAREER project seeks to address these challenges by exploring how the physical properties of biomaterials, particularly surface topographies or patterns, affect the behavior of immune cells and their interactions with pathogens. Although surface nano- and micro-patterning is commonly used in medical devices such as implants (e.g., orthopedic, dental, breast) and catheters to improve performance, its effects on immune defenses and infection risk are largely unknown. By studying how topography affects host?pathogen interactions in both 2D and 3D settings, this research will provide deeper insights into the relationships between biomaterials, host cells, and bacteria. These findings will establish new design rules for biomaterials that can enhance immune defenses, fight infections, and improve implant success. Furthermore, the research program will be integrated with a collaborative education and outreach plan, including STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) initiatives and public outreach activities, to increase awareness about the importance of biomaterials and implant infections while promoting STEM education and interdisciplinary learning. <br/> <br/>This CAREER project will address critical knowledge gaps in understanding how surface topographies on biomaterials affect interactions between host immune cells and pathogens. Despite evidence suggesting that nanoscale and microscale surface patterns can modulate bacterial behavior and immune responses, their effects on host?pathogen interactions remain poorly understood. Using a bottom-up patterning approach, the research will generate a library of topographies with precisely tuned nano to microscale features to investigate how surface topography modulates host?pathogen dynamics. The central hypothesis is that precise spatial patterning of biomaterials can restore immune balance and enhance host defenses, thereby improving infection control. This hypothesis will be tested through two objectives: (1) elucidate how controlled 2D topographies affect the regulatory role of immune cells in controlling bacterial infections; and (2) analyze the impact of 3D topographical cues on cell responses to gain insights into the topography?host?pathogen interactions in extracellular matrix-like 3D environments. To achieve this, versatile 3D patterning tools will be developed by incorporating 3D elements into the fabrication process, enabling precise patterning across various scales and geometries. Fundamental insights gained on interactions between biomaterial topography, the host, and bacteria will facilitate the rational design of immune-instructive biomaterials, ultimately leading to effective strategies to combat implant infections and improve patient outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The system uses electrolysis (a process where electricity splits water into hydrogen and oxygen) to make very clean hydrogen gas. This hydrogen can be used in portable energy solutions?like fuel cells in cars, mobile chargers, or backup power systems. At the same time, the system is also designed to process metal ores (natural rocks that contain metal). Using electricity and chemical reactions, it extracts the useful metals (like iron, copper, or nickel) from these ores, which can reduce waste and add value by turning raw materials into usable metals. The project addresses a critical national need by offering a scalable alternative to traditional energy and material extraction processes. The electrolysis targets dual challenges of ensuring secure energy storage and recovering essential metals used in high priority industrial and defense applications. This innovation promises societal benefits by enhancing energy security and contributing to the national interest through improved material recovery methods, which support economic growth, and the well-being for all Americans. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an integrated electrolysis process that combines advanced non-precious group metal (PGM) / metal oxide (MO) technology and optimized reaction conditions to yield ultrapure hydrogen while achieving the reduction of ores to extract critical metals. The technology leverages controlled electrochemical reactions and state-of-the-art material science to enhance purity and yield beyond conventional methods. Rigorous experimental validation and systematic parameter optimization ensure that the process delivers a consistent quality product and reliable performance under practical operating conditions. The technical innovation underlying this solution not only improves energy conversion efficiency but also contributes to national security by ensuring a stable supply of metals vital for industrial and defense applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell therapy is an emerging clinical method of producing lasting remission in cancer patients by re engineering patient?s own T cells. The therapy also remains under active investigation for other emerging applications. The T cells in nearly half of cancer patients eligible for CAR T cell therapy are not sufficiently healthy to be successfully manufactured into viable and effective CAR T cells for use as intended. This leads to CAR T cell manufacturing failures for 15-69% of patients, resulting in a significant burden to the health care system with an estimated cost of $375k per patient along with increased risks to patient morbidity and severe adverse events. The system aims to be the first to correlate specific quantifiable energy measures with CAR T cell manufacturing failure risks. If successful this new screening method would provide a high throughput system capable of identifying patients at high risk for CAR T cell manufacturing failure with reduced time, labor for optimization and reagent validation than current methods. This would allow patients to pursue other clinical options sooner rather than undergoing ineffective CAR T therapy thereby enabling them to see alternative viable options sonner while reducing unnecessary health care resource utilization.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel instrument for assessing the health of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells before undergoing the isolation and modification process for oncological therapeutic use.

Conventional admittance-matrix-based power grid topological models have been shown to lack analytical capabilities to effectively model ubiquitous flexibility, capacity, and prosumer profiles and enable granular and accurate controls of the ultra-high-dimensional distributed energy resources. This project aims to transcend the state-of-the-art, and will develop a data adaptive graph generation module, topological data analytical techniques with multiple filtrations, higher-order network models, and input layers for deep neural networks that take topological signatures and higher-order interactions for (dynamic) networks. The project will integrate ubiquitous, high-dimensional information structures on transmission nodes by taking properties of power systems as special directions and designing new perspectives at the intersection of algebraic topology, commutative algebra, and deep learning. Fundamentally, this project will directly benefit local and national interests as well as guide the modeling, operation, and control of wide-area power transmission networks with ultra-high-dimensional penetration of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems. The project framework will serve as a tool to enhance the reliability and resiliency of power grids, improve power systems quality. Developments from this project have the potential to significantly lower energy costs, directly benefit national economic growth, and substantially reduce the frequency and severity of power outages caused by extreme weather events.  In addition, students working on this project research will acquire an excellent orientation of cross-disciplinary work and experience at the interface of computer science, mathematics, data science, and electrical engineering.<br/><br/>This project is a first attempt to bring the emerging machinery of adaptive graph structure learning, topological data analysis, simplicial complex-level representation learning, and (geometric) deep learning to power grids. Thus, this project will fundamentally redesign existing power grid topology and uncover the fundamental mechanisms of embedding ubiquitous, local topological information, and high-dimensional structures on transmission nodes via higher-order topological graph models and learning methods. Furthermore, the project techniques will include generalizable capability and so can be applied to many different settings involving dynamic networks. These approaches and newly developed topological and higher-order interactions representations learning modules will pave the way for new research directions in computational topology, machine learning and data science. Moreover, the project will contribute an open-source software library to obtain topological summaries learned from the multifiltration of power system data based on techniques developed within the project. These tools in return will enhance new applications of machine learning and deep learning tools for large-scale power system analysis that are deemed infeasible today due to high computational costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first topic, ""balancing problems for partially ordered sets,"" is motivated by questions about sorting, among the most basic of algorithmic tasks; the second, ""thresholds,"" has been central to the study of discrete random systems since its beginnings around 1960.  Though much of the PI's work has ties to other disciplines---and some of it has had unanticipated applied consequences---the emphasis is usually on what seems most interesting from a mathematical standpoint.  The PI has long been interested in working across mathematical boundaries.  He has had success both in applying ideas from areas beyond combinatorics (e.g., algebra, geometry, topology, probability, Fourier analysis, information theory) to settle combinatorial problems, and in bringing combinatorial ideas to bear on problems from other areas (e.g., geometry, computer science, probability, statistical mechanics).  As in the current work, he has usually focused on simple, basic questions with histories of resisting solution, motivated in part by the idea that success with such questions almost always forces one to go beyond existing methods. The project will involve graduate students.<br/><br/>The project treats two combinatorial topics that are among the PI's main current interests.  The first deals with a set of notorious old, algorithmically motivated ""balancing"" questions for partially ordered sets; here the PI and his student M. Aires have recently made striking progress, eclipsing all that was previously known in the way of general results, and introducing new methods together with an extensive list of previously unconsidered, though seemingly basic, questions. Part of the appeal of this area is the interplay of extra-combinatorial ideas (from geometry, probability, and information theory) that underlie some of the results. The second topic is ""thresholds,"" roughly meaning the intensities at which various behaviors of interest appear in a (large) random system; these have been central to probabilistic combinatorics and related parts of statistical physics since at least Erdos and Renyi in 1960.  Recent breakthroughs by the PI and others on the ``Kahn-Kalai Conjecture'' of 2008 have refocused research in this area, rendering previously formidable results easy, and offering hope for (and already a few resolutions of) problems previously considered completely out of reach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A comprehensive understanding of how firn densifies into solid ice is important for several reasons: (1) to interpret ice sheet mass balance changes from remote-sensing observations; (2) to determine how the microstructural evolution of firn contributes to the resulting ice sheet microstructure and its ice flow rates; and (3) most importantly for better interpretation of ice-core paleoclimate records by understanding how air becomes entrapped in the firn, and ultimately in the ice. Currently, firn densification is not fully understood, and a physics-based model based on experimentally-observed deformation mechanisms is needed to improve our firn estimates for the important applications described above. This research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the compaction and microstructural evolution of polar firn by performing mechanical testing, and characterization of the resulting microstructure on firn cores from four different locations at Taylor Dome, Antarctica. Results from each of these firn cores will provide valuable information about how firn microstructure, and its impact on densification, evolves under varying environmental conditions outside the range of existing datasets. The research will involve a PhD student and several undergraduates.<br/><br/>Densification of polar firn involves several different mechanisms including pressure sintering, plastic deformation, grain rearrangement, and, near the surface, temperature gradient metamorphism due to water vapor transport. A key step towards a physics-based firn model is understanding how the microstructure impacts the dominant deformation mechanism(s) at different depths in the firn column. This project will provide valuable data needed to answer this question by performing creep tests and characterizing the microstructural evolution under creep loading on firn cores drilled to pore close-off at four different locations at Taylor Dome, Antarctica. Each of the four firn-core sites vary in their annual accumulation rate (2 cm.a-1, 4 cm.a-1, 8 cm.a-1, 25 cm.a-1), creating different microstructure-depth profiles. We will use a unique combination of X-ray micro-CT imaging coupled with high-resolution imaging of the evolved microstructure using a scanning electron microscope equipped with electron backscatter diffraction, that will provide 3-D orientation information. In addition, we will examine the local microchemistry, particularly around bonds between grains, using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the SEM and Raman spectroscopy in an optical imaging system. These results will allow for a full analysis of the role firn microstructure has on densification.

These events can be studied using gravitational-wave observatories, such as NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and ground-based and space-based observatories, such as NSF's Vera Rubin Observatory and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. Through these cosmic collisions it is possible to study, among others, the nature of matter at supernuclear densities, testing quantum chromo dynamics in a regime that cannot be probed on Earth, the nuclear physics involved in the formation of rare-earth elements, gold, and alkali metals, and the outcome of the evolution of massive stars. This project aims to develop the theoretical framework necessary to interpret upcoming observations and advance research in these areas. In particular, the team will construct a large template of synthetic neutron star merger observations, leveraging new national computing resources to perform sophisticated general-relativistic simulations. These data will then be used to develop statistical and artificial intelligence models that can be used to interpret real observations. This project will train one US graduate student and three US undergraduate students at the interface between high-performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, and machine learning, thus strengthening the US STEM workforce. This project will also develop new simulations and data analysis techniques and produce open-source code for the benefit of the broader STEM community. This work will be performed in collaboration with researchers at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität, funded by the German science agency DFG, and will include a research exchange program with Germany, thereby strengthening bilateral ties with Germany.<br/><br/>The project will assemble a comprehensive, publicly accessible database of double neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star merger simulations and leverage it for multimessenger astronomy.

For each simulation, the team will release the multipole-decomposed gravitational-wave signal, mass ejecta, and remnant properties, including 3D snapshots that could be used as initial conditions for longer-term postmerger simulations. The team will use the data to inform and calibrate 1) merger and post-merger gravitational-wave waveform models; 2) understand the critical physical dependencies of the post-merger evolution of binary neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star mergers; 3) data-driven models of the ejecta; and of 4) the expected thermal and non-thermal counterparts to mergers. These data and models will be the theoretical foundation for the interpretation of future merger observations.

Human influence on ecosystems is expanding rapidly, but data on ecosystems? responses to rapid or extreme impacts is limited. The fossil record contains many examples. Generally, paleontological reconstruction relies upon modern food web properties, but this correspondence breaks down after mass extinctions. Recovering ecosystems deviate significantly from expectations of how ecosystems function. This project will examine marine ecosystems spanning the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, 251 million years ago, when 80% of species became extinct. The project will reconstruct the ways in which ancient ecosystems adapted to extreme disturbances by using fossils collected in the field and deposited in museum collections combined with high performance computing analyses. The project will support and train numerous students and an early career scientist in analytical and museum curation skills.  <br/> 	<br/>Reconstructing ancient ecosystems relies on models of interspecific interactions, operating under a uniformitarian assumption that the principles determining interactions remain constant through evolutionary time. The resulting probabilistic food webs provide insights into the robustness of past ecosystems. This project challenges the uniformitarian assumption by proposing a framework within which to test alternative assumptions of species properties following extreme ecological disturbances. This project will examine Permian-Triassic communities, including mass extinction-spanning and recovery communities, questioning whether communities immediately after mass extinctions were structured and functioned differently from those during environmentally quiescent times. The project will mobilize new and existing fossil collections, as well as offer paleontological training to community college and high school students. A post-doctoral researcher will participate to enhance analytical skills, develop museum experience, and hone scientific communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, bats are essential to maintaining ecosystem health through seed dispersal, pollination, and insect control. This paradox emphasizes the urgent need to understand the disease ecology of bats in the interest of global health. Understanding how to monitor, characterize, and disseminate information about pathogen spillover is critical to global public health and Southeast Asian countries are at the highest risk of wildlife zoonotic outbreaks due to immense biodiversity found in this region. The urgency of these circumstances requires training of the future generation of scientists to connect and collaborate with scientists in high-need regions, where scientists, educators, and public health officials may lack the necessary training to monitor wildlife in a genomic and evolutionary framework. This IRES project trains U.S. student participants in fieldwork methods and analytical approaches for studying pathogens in wildlife reservoirs using affordable and portable biotechnology. The students are also trained in education and science communication techniques necessary for sharing information related to these topics. The program hosts up to 8 U.S. students per year at the Center for Biodiversity and Endangered Species (CBES) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Students conduct sampling in a national park inventorying the bat biodiversity and microbes occurring within the region. <br/><br/>To understand the diversity of microbes in the environment, how they circulate, and how they evolve within and between their hosts, scientists must sample the data directly from the environment, extract genetic material, sequence this genetic material, and characterize the microbes in the sample with computational methods to visualize the results. Students participating in this research are being trained in genomic surveillance techniques of zoonotic pathogens with low-cost ?backpack laboratory? approaches.  The project provides a high-quality international research experience for U.S. students that builds collaborative monitoring efforts with scientists in Vietnam while also establishing scientific communication training protocols to facilitate scientific discussion amongst disciplines and dissemination of appropriate information to policymakers and the public. Bats are used as a framework for teaching these protocols, as they are central to public health in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. participants benefit from the experience by learning about the ecology, evolution, and immunology of many unique bat species distributed throughout Vietnam and Southeast Asia. However, these techniques are not unique to bats and can be extrapolated to any environmental monitoring and surveillance program. During the students? research experience, they engage in data collection and analysis for two major projects.  The first is a metagenomic surveillance project that involves collecting bat feces, comparing pathogens present at two sampling localities, and documenting in a library of pathogenic strains of bacteria with metadata documentation in a public repository. The second is a science communication project that includes writing a series of podcasts with local collaborators to be released throughout the year, a three-minute thesis style competition of the study abroad experience, and social media engagement to communicate the importance of bats to ecosystem health. Overall, the students are being trained in field-based genomic methods, data analysis techniques with an evolutionary perspective, and data visualization to be used in peer-reviewed publications and public dissemination of results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, it is well-known that the fluid drag on particles in dead-end channels is greater than in free space. This is relevant in many applications, including biological fluids such as blood, in which the suspended red blood cells and platelets become non-uniformly distributed in the bloodstream as a result of boundary interactions. However, confined suspensions are challenging to simulate because of their multiscale nature and the difficulty of resolving the thin films that may develop between particles and boundaries. This project aims to model and simulate confined suspensions in order to accurately capture the effects of boundaries. The goal is to study the fluid dynamics of suspensions in confined geometries and accelerate simulations of these phenomena.<br/><br/>To achieve the project goals, a hierarchy of mathematical models and numerical methods will be developed. Simulations of fluid-structure interaction will be performed to explicitly capture the wall-induced migration of elastic objects away from walls, and these will be used to parameterize a reduced model of elastic deformations and corresponding lift coefficients. In addition, the classical Oldroyd-B model of non-Newtonian fluids will be revisited to incorporate the effect of a heterogeneous particle distribution near boundaries, and the method of images will be applied to extend the Stokeslet solution to the case of dead-end geometries. Taken together, these projects will provide a set of practical numerical and analytical tools to study the behavior of suspensions in the presence of boundaries. As broader outcomes, the results from this work will be integrated into course materials, and open-source implementations of the resulting computational methods will be released to make them widely accessible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional detection methods are accurate, but they are costly, slow, and often destructive. Image analysis based on artificial intelligence (AI) offers a faster, nondestructive alternative but struggles to detect internal or microbial contamination. This project will use an electronic nose (e-nose) to detect food contamination by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A major challenge is that VOCs from multiple foods can blend, making detection difficult. The team will develop AI models trained on thousands of VOC samples to enable the e-nose to separate odors and identify contamination, even in complex mixtures and varying environments. The improved e-nose will enhance food safety and will have broader applications in healthcare (e.g., disease detection from a patient's breath), security, and robotics. The project will be integrated into machine learning courses at KSU, offering students hands-on experience with AI-driven sensors and promoting interdisciplinary training in olfactory sensing.<br/><br/>Electronic noses (e-noses) detect odors by sensing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and provide fast, non-destructive screening for food safety. However, VOCs often blend in multi-food environments, making it difficult to identify contamination in specific items. These challenges are further complicated by environmental variations, such as changes in temperature. This project aims to advance e-nose technology by leveraging AI to improve odor detection in complex settings. The research team will develop contrastive learning models that train deep neural networks to distinguish odors from co-present foods and adapt to varying atmospheric conditions. These models will also enable the detection of contaminated foods, whether presented individually or in mixtures. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on single-food comparisons or low-level chemical profiling, this project introduces robust AI techniques to identify contamination across diverse food combinations. By constructing reliable odor representations, the work addresses critical limitations in current e-nose systems and offers new insights into odor dynamics, with potential parallels to human olfaction. Improved e-noses could significantly enhance food safety, enable breath-based disease detection in healthcare, and improve situational awareness in AI and robotic systems across applications such as security, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HABs in freshwater bodies pose significant threats to both public health and the environment. These blooms, often fueled by excess nutrients such as phosphorus, can produce toxins that affect water quality. The neurotoxins released by certain bacteria species can contaminate water supplies, posing serious risks to human health. The rapid growth of these blooms can disrupt local ecosystems, harm biodiversity, and impact agriculture, tourism, and recreation. Timely monitoring of HABs and water conditions is critical for taking prompt action to protect public health and water safety and security. Current in-situ and remote sensing methods are limited by factors such as high labor intensity and cost, inefficiency, and an inability to provide real-time monitoring. This sensing system facilitates the identification of nutrient sources and conditions that promote algal bloom formation, helping to inform targeted strategies for mitigating or preventing future outbreaks. Furthermore, by tracking HABs and measuring water condition parameters, this technology allows researchers and policymakers to evaluate the effects of these events on aquatic ecosystems, including potential changes in species composition and ecosystem services. This solution has the potential to enhance sensing efficiency, reduce cost, expand coverage, and deliver more comprehensive monitoring results. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

This award integrates geospatial data like satellite imagery, population count data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to locate those high-risk micro-regions in Southern Africa. By revealing Potential Human-Vector Contact Zones (PHVCZ) that concentrate both human movement and mosquito activity, the work will guide bed-net distribution, indoor insecticide spraying, and community outreach to the places that save the most lives while reducing costs. Open-source software, training workshops, and publicly released risk maps will strengthen disease-control capacity in partner countries and provide a template for confronting other mosquito-borne threats such as dengue and Zika, thereby promoting national and global welfare.<br/><br/>This award develops a novel, integrated geospatial framework that applies advanced machine learning techniques to map disease-transmission risk. High-resolution satellite imagery is processed with computer-vision methods and enriched with building information, road networks, land-cover classifications, community points of interest, and population data to generate seasonally stable maps of human activity zones encompassing residential areas, farms, commercial centers, and transportation corridors. These human-activity maps are combined with weather variables and mosquito-surveillance records from research centers in Southern and Central Africa to drive computational models that simulate vector-human contact patterns. A specialized statistical approach links the predicted density of these contact zones to ten years of regional malaria data, iteratively refining model parameters until outputs mirror observed disease patterns across diverse transmission settings.

Diverse treatment of vegetation and its interaction with the global carbon cycle in Earth System Models (ESMs) is an important source of uncertainty in climate and vegetation projections. This study aims to construct an optimized machine learning model based on select climate state variables to predict vegetation parameters globally for both the historical period and the late 21st century. The project provides a first attempt at quantifying vegetation-climate feedbacks using machine learning on a global scale and has the potential to overcome deficiencies in process-based (physical) models of these feedbacks. The produced vegetation scenarios will be shared with the broader Earth system modeling community, which will facilitate an ongoing dialogue on the use of machine learning for vegetation modeling. The lead investigator is active in communicating scientific issues to local, state, and federal government stake holders, increasing the impact of this research beyond the scientific discipline. In addition, the principal investigators will incorporate the tools and results of this work into term projects and learning modules for their online courses and machine learning summer research and lecture series for high school students, increasing scientific literacy on artificial intelligence tools used to tackle important Earth system science questions.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to quantify and understand the potential contribution of vegetation-climate interactions to projected climate changes, and to characterize and ultimately reduce uncertainties in climate projection related to vegetation feedback. Specific objectives include: 1) to innovate vegetation prediction via machine learning approaches, utilizing both observational datasets and output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ESMs; 2) to project future vegetation changes and identify sources of uncertainties, employing the newly developed machine learning models in tandem with ESMs? climate and vegetation output. The team hypothesizes that 1) machine learning models broadly trained on historical data are transferable (spatially and temporally) to future periods outside the training data sets, allowing the models to predict both gradual changes and abrupt shifts of vegetation caused by climate changes; 2) the process-based vegetation model dominates over the ESMs? climate uncertainty as the primary source of uncertainties for the ESM-projected vegetation changes. The research will harness advances in machine learning and take advantage of high-resolution satellite remote sensing and reanalysis data, as well as existing output from CMIP6 ESMs. Combining machine learning with ESMs, the project will characterize and attribute uncertainties in vegetation and climate projections and examine the realism of the vegetation-climate relationship underlying each ESM vegetation model, and project vegetation using optimal machine learning models. The project will accelerate and improve vegetation prediction by innovating deep learning models, which uniquely enables the attribution of uncertainties to vegetation model structure and ESM climate. Results from this project will help strategize future model development efforts, pave the way for incorporating machine learning vegetation models into ESMs as an alternative to process-based models, and ultimately reduce uncertainties in Earth system projections. More broadly, the spatial hotspots of climate-induced vegetation changes produced in this project will guide the siting of future field experiments and long-term monitoring of ongoing changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FBAs are small synthetic molecules that mimic the natural genetic bases ? adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U) ? in DNA and RNA. Ideal FBAs preserve base-pairing properties while allowing sensitive detection of structural changes, molecular interactions, and other features relevant to genetic regulation. However, designing effective FBAs is challenging due to the difficulty of predicting how fluorescence responds in complex and dynamic biological environments like nucleic acids. This research aims to determine how molecular structure and local environment influence key FBA properties: brightness, photostability, and the ability to report on significant changes in biomolecular environment. The intellectual merit lies in advancing the understanding of how fluorophore chemical structure affects fluorescence and how fluorescence changes in response to the local chemical environment, and specifically when incorporated within DNA and RNA. Broader impacts include enabling new tools for genetic research and biotechnology, and training graduate students and undergraduates in synthetic and physical organic chemistry with interdisciplinary applications.<br/><br/>Two fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs) have been created that (1) mimics cytosine but becomes fluorescent upon base pairing with guanine (G) and (2) is sufficiently bright for single molecule detection, respectively. However, the bulkiness of the cytosine mimic (DEAtC) limits its biological compatibility, and the relatively rapid photobleaching of these and other FBAs limits applications in confocal fluorescence microscopy and single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy. The mechanisms of fluorescence turn-on and photobleaching are not known for these compounds, limiting the ability to improve on their properties. Accordingly, this research seeks to address these knowledge gaps and create improved FBAs in the following specific aims. (1) Investigate mechanisms of fluorescence turn-on in response to base pairing and stacking. (2) Improve the photostability of pyrimidine analogue FBAs. (3) Investigate two alternative FBA scaffolds designed to attain (i) high brightness from a small size and (ii) excitation at > 450 nm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through these efforts, this project tackles a pressing societal problem and helps cultivate a diverse new generation of engineers while increasing public awareness of child-centric biometric technologies.<br/><br/>The project's objectives are to: 1) design age-adaptive biometric identification systems for young children (ages 0?4) across multiple modalities (facial, fingerprint, and iris recognition); 2) integrate quality-aware image capture and real-time authentication capabilities into miniaturized biometric devices to ensure high-quality data collection for this age group; 3) conduct an expanded longitudinal study with the newly developed biometric technologies to characterize how children's biometric traits evolve as they grow and to develop predictive models that keep identification accurate over time; and 4) establish privacy-compliant data collection protocols and collaborate with industry, government, and community partners (e.g., healthcare and educational organizations) to refine the technology and ensure its broad applicability. This approach will yield new knowledge on the stability and maturation of biometric traits in early childhood, along with practical age-tailored biometric tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One can visualize a Gibbs measure by imagining water waves rippling across a lake on a windy day. The waves are constantly in motion, and yet the overall appearance of the lake's surface remains roughly unchanged over time. This is because, although the system is dynamic, certain statistical properties like the number of waves, average height, and average velocity remain constant. In this way, the surface of the lake is not in equilibrium in the traditional sense, but rather in statistical equilibrium. Beyond water waves, Gibbs measures and their dynamics play a central role in several areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, plasma physics, and Euclidean quantum field theory. In addition to being of physical significance, Gibbs measures and their dynamics pose numerous mathematical challenges. The central mathematical challenge lies in understanding how the randomness introduced by the Gibbs measure evolves under the dynamics. In the setting of water waves described above, for example, one may need to understand the likelihood of a large wave being formed by several smaller waves. This project advances our mathematical understanding of physical phenomena and helps train both undergraduate and graduate students, thereby strengthening the STEM workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators pursue three projects at the interface of partial differential equations and probability theory, which aim to solve major open problems concerning Gibbs measures and their dynamics. In the first project, the PI studies the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation in three dimensions and plans to prove the invariance of the corresponding Gibbs measure. This is the first invariance result for a Gibbs measure that is critical with respect to probabilistic scaling. In the second project, the PI studies the well-posedness of the stochastic wave maps equation. Due to the geometric nature of the wave maps equation, this project not only combines techniques from partial differential equations and probability theory, but also differential geometry. In the third project, the PI plans to establish the global well-posedness of the stochastic Yang-Mills-Higgs heat flow in two dimensions. This result can be used to rigorously construct the two-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs measures, which play a central role in Euclidean quantum field theory. The three research projects described above forge new connections between partial differential equations, probability theory, and differential geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The appearance of angiosperms and their diversification changed the planet in important ways. Understanding the history of how angiosperms evolved is key to explaining how they became so widespread and diverse. However, we still do not fully understand when or how angiosperms began to diversify, which prevents us from determining what caused their rapid spread. Studies using molecular data show that flowering plants may have evolved much earlier than the first fossil evidence indicates. This project aims to bridge the divide between molecular studies and fossils by focusing on the pollen records of the Chloranthaceae. The Chloranthaceae comprise a flowering plant family that includes some of the oldest angiosperm fossils. The project will use advanced techniques like optical superresolution microscopy, deep learning, and new methods for reconstructing evolutionary trees. It will train two postdoctoral researchers in these cutting-edge biological and computer science methods. In addition, the project will work with non-profit groups and the UK Open University?s OpenLearn platform to offer free online educational materials about the evolution of flowering plants to the global community.<br/><br/>This study will build a new phylogenomic tree for Chloranthaceae and use phylogenetically-informed deep learning models to place Chloranthaceae fossils within this new phylogeny. Placing fossils within the phylogeny will establish the timing of diversification within the plant family and whether Early Cretaceous (125 million years ago) Chloranthaceae pollen, which are the earliest fossil evidence for this group, represent early- or late-diverging species. If the fossils represent early-diverging species, this will support an Early Cretaceous origin for the Chloranthaceae. If the fossils represent late-diverging species, this will support a much older origination date in line with molecular estimates. Establishing the age of Chloranthaceae will also help resolve the timing of diversification of early angiosperms more broadly by constraining the ages of lineages at the base of the angiosperm phylogeny and will address the debate on when the first flowering plants appeared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By itself, this is a deterministic question, hence, it is surprising that introducing some randomness into the problem can make it easier. This project will develop and use probabilistic methods to study deterministic objects with sophisticated structure, to describe their typical behavior, what types of symmetries the structures have, and what types of models can be used to detect their properties. The PI plans to use deep tools that he and collaborators have developed in recent years to address fundamental conjectures on various types of groups that describe number theoretic, geometric, or topological properties.  The PI will lead activities to train future researchers in this active area, including the organization of a year-long emphasis year at Northwestern University with a spring school aimed at students and an international conference for experts, the organization of a special session at a major conference in January 2026, and the teaching of a research seminar aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Building on the text recently completed by the PI, he will write another book on specialized topics related to this project, and building on the experience the PI has in supervising undergraduates in a research program, the PI will direct additional cohorts of students.<br/><br/>The main techniques on which the project relies were developed in the last three years and have already proven useful. Among other problems, the PI will focus on the Margulis ergodicity conjecture (a variant of a conjecture of Schoen and Yau), the Nori problem, and the Stuck--Zimmer conjecture. In particular, the PI will build on his very recent breakthroughs in the third topic. The PI's past research had an impact on various fields including geometric and combinatorial group theory, finite groups, differential geometry, algebraic number theory, automorphic forms, representation theory, topology, operator algebras, combinatorics, computer science and theoretical physics, and future impacts are expected. Specifically, progress in the Nori problem may provide tools to distinguish between thin and arithmetic groups. Such techniques are currently unavailable but required in many situations, e.g. when studying the monodromy groups of hypergeometric equations. Solving the Stuck--Zimmer conjecture will have many applications, in particular to the study of limit multiplicity theorems and Plancherel measures associated with Hilbert--Blumenthal modular varieties.

Severe winds such as hurricanes and tornadoes threaten millions of homes yearly, putting lives at risk and causing billions of dollars in property loss. Many existing residential structures are not built to withstand such events, exposing families to danger and financial hardship. This project explores a reinforcement approach that improves the wind resistance of homes by enhancing key structural connections and increasing the building's ability to withstand extreme weather. The solution is designed to be low-cost, easy to install, and compatible with existing construction practices, making it accessible for widespread implementation. By increasing structural stability, the solution has the potential to save lives, reduce costly repairs, lower insurance claims and preserve property values in vulnerable regions. With over 80 million single-family homes in the United States ? and nearly half located in areas prone to high winds ? the scale of the problem is significant. Broad adoption of this innovation can strengthen community resilience, reduce long-term recovery costs, and support a more stable housing market.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on developing a composite structural connection system that enhances wind resilience in wood-framed buildings by establishing a continuous and uniform load path. Unlike traditional fastening methods that rely on discrete connectors such as nails or screws that are prone to stress concentration and failure under uplift ? this system integrates elastomeric adhesive bonding with dimensional wood blocks at key connection points. This method forms an adhesive interface between framing members, roof sheathing, and the foundation, enabling distributed stress transfer while reducing the risk of localized failure during high-wind events. The technical innovation leverages the application of advanced adhesive dynamics in combination with structural wood behavior to deliver superior uplift resistance, validated through experimental cyclic and static testing. Analytical modeling further supports its effectiveness by quantifying stress redistribution, and connection durability under repeated wind loading. This solution is designed for the ease of application in both new construction and retrofit scenarios, requiring minimal occupant disruption. The system?s compatibility with existing framing configurations and compliance with building codes positions this method as a feasible upgrade over conventional retrofitting approaches. The outcome of this project could establish new design standards in residential construction, enhance disaster resilience, and broaden the application of composite material science in structural engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Obtaining access to the entire genomic sequence of a species, which is called genome sequencing, can enable life scientists and medical researchers to understand the causes of diseases, develop personalized medicine, identify genetic variations within populations, study evolution, and develop new treatments or cures for diseases. Due to technological limitations of DNA sequencing instruments, scientists can only read a limited amount of DNA and not entire chromosomes. As a consequence, scientists have to break the genome into fragments before reading each fragment using a sequencing instrument. Once fragments are sequenced, they need to be assembled together like a puzzle that contains billion of pieces. This problem is called genome assembly, which is the focus of this research project. Due to complexity of solving this problem, the organisms sequenced so far represent a minuscule proportion of those that inhabit our planet, many of which we depend on for our food or against which we must defend to sustain human society. The long-term impact of obtaining the genome of a new species can be profound and impactful once the sequence becomes a routine component of practical problem solving and downstream analyses for the scientific community. This project focuses on developing new methods that would allow a much more accurate and efficient genome assembly for many organisms. <br/><br/><br/>The problem of genome assembly is one of the most studied problems in computational biology, yet it remains computationally challenging due to the high repetitive content of eukaryotic genomes, short read length, uneven sequencing coverage, non-uniform sequencing errors,  and chimeric reads. As exemplified by the 20-year timeframe to obtain the last 8% of the human genome, producing a telomere-to-telomere gapless assembly still requires a substantial amount of resources, which are typically not available to the average lab. This research project focuses on closing assembly gaps, i.e., the problem of reconstructing correctly the repetitive sequences which are usually the hardest to assemble. The research plan includes the following tasks. (i) Develop a de novo repeat assembly method for Hi-Fi reads based on single-copy k-mers (ii) Develop a haplotype-aware repeat assembly method for Hi-Fi reads based on single-copy k-mers (iii) Develop a de novo assembly method for ultra-deep HiFi reads. The proposed solutions will involve the innovative use of single-copy k-mers (fixed length, variable length, homopolymer-compressed) and the design of new combinatorial algorithms for phasing and iterative meta-assembly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing physical components are too error-prone to construct a useful quantum computer. The PI and research team aim to adopt an emerging physical approach for storing and manipulating quantum information called ?bosonic encodings?. This approach enjoys a high degree of efficiency in the number of resources necessary to protect against errors in stored information. However, the available quantum logic operations do not retain the protection of bosonic encodings. Therefore, our research will develop new strategies for quantum logic operations that preserve the built-in error protection of bosonic encodings. By conducting such research, the project will take a major step toward scalable quantum computers. The project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science through research that pushes the boundaries of quantum control and error correction, which are critical building blocks for quantum computers.<br/><br/>Bosonic encodings of logical quantum information offer hardware-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. This has the potential to reduce the resource-overheads necessary to achieve a useful quantum computer. However, missing from this approach is a complete set of logical gates to enable active manipulation of stored information while maintaining the full error correction properties of the encoding. With a combined theoretical, computational, and experimental effort, the team proposes to advance quantum control methods so that this becomes possible. Specifically, the research team will aim to advance our novel concept of photon number parity-nested control operations on a binomial encoding by taking advantage of optimal-control derived squeezing-based operations of an oscillator. The research team will complete analytic and numerically-optimized gate sets for such squeezing-based operations and accomplish experiments that accomplish error-transparent magnitude-mixing operations on a bosonic encoding in superconducting hardware.

Saltwater intrusion, the movement of seawater into freshwater resources, poses significant threats to the state's drinking water supplies, agriculture, natural ecosystems, and infrastructure. This project aims to advance understanding of the processes driving saltwater intrusion and develop strategies to mitigate its impacts. The research team, consisting of faculty, staff, and students from Delaware State University, Delaware Technical Community College, Goldey-Beacom College, Wilmington University, and University of Delaware, will collaborate with partners across the state to address this pressing challenge. They will collect field data, conduct experiments, and develop computer models to study how various factors affect saltwater intrusion in urban, suburban, rural, and natural areas. The project will also explore innovative solutions, such as developing salinity-resistant crops, facilitating marsh migration, and promoting wetland-based carbon removal. By engaging partners throughout the State and training the next generation of social and natural scientists and engineers, the project aims to enhance regional resilience and promote long-term economic well-being. Ultimately, the project will provide vital information to support sustainable water management, protect Delaware's valuable water resources, and ensure a resilient future for coastal communities in Delaware and beyond.<br/><br/>The project will employ a convergent, multidisciplinary approach to elucidate the complex hydrologic, geologic, biogeochemical, economic, and social factors impacting saltwater intrusion in Delaware's coastal environments. The project team will establish a network of monitoring wells to continuously measure groundwater salinity, collect geophysical data to characterize subsurface aquifer structure, and use advanced geochemical tracers to fingerprint the sources and pathways of saltwater intrusion. High-resolution numerical models, coupling surface water and groundwater dynamics, will be developed to simulate the interplay between various environmental factors, groundwater abstraction, and human decision-making on saltwater intrusion. The project will investigate the physical risks (hazards, exposure, and vulnerabilities) and assess how people make decisions related to water withdrawals, land uses, stormwater and infrastructure management, adaptation, and mitigation in urban, suburban, rural, and natural systems. Innovative solutions, such as targeted aquifer recharge, coastal wetland restoration, salinity-resistant crops, marsh migration strategies, and ecosystem service incentives, will be proposed and developed to mitigate the impacts of saltwater intrusion. The project will support and mentor six early-career faculty, two post-doctoral researchers, 36 graduate students, and at least 40 undergraduate students, engaging them in professional development cohorts across institutions to build workforce skills, team science, communication, and problem-solving.

The enhanced tool developed in this project will initially be deployed and outcomes assessed in theoretical computer science courses at the five collaborating institutions. It will be made available under an opensource license to enable others to use and modify the software to suit their needs. The research questions are focused on understanding the impacts of the tool on students' behavior, performance, and learning of computing theory; whether students from different types of institutions are impacted in significantly different ways; and the effects of various types of feedback on students' learning. The tool's added functionality, improved usability, and availability as opensource software will encourage its adoption at other institutions and increase its educational benefits.

It will also train students to conduct and use research to improve community health and mental health outcomes.<br/><br/>There are three primary factors leading to hallucinations in LMMs. First, it is widely understood that biased data distribution causes significant challenges in data-driven responsible AI approaches. However, biased distribution influence on predictions is also a leading cause of hallucinations in LMMs. Second, the misalignment between input modalities could result in the LMMs overconfidently relying on a particular input modality and ignoring others. As a result, the LMMs could hallucinate the predictions based on the dominant modality. Third, training LMMs often requires large-scale training data. The limited data could result in hallucinations in LMMs due to the lack of knowledge and diverse information. The overarching goal of this project is to develop robust and trustable LMMs to mitigate hallucination in large language models. First, to address the imbalanced data, new learning approaches will be introduced to mitigate the hallucinations caused by imbalanced data. Second, novel shuffling learning approaches will be developed to address the problem of misalignment across input modalities. Third, to overcome the problem of limited data, new adaptive learning approaches will be developed to improve the performance and trustworthiness of the LMMs. The LMMs in this project are then deployed into practical healthcare applications. The research effort in this project will pave the way to develop new theoretical and practical approaches to distribution modeling, contrastive learning, and shuffling learning to address hallucinations in LMMs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their importance, kinetic equations remain challenging to solve. This difficulty arises from their high dimensionality, the presence of multiple scales, and the need to preserve key structures such as conservation, positivity, and entropy dissipation. Additionally, the multi-query task of parameter identification places a higher demand on solver's efficiency. This project intends to address these challenges by developing efficient and scalable variational computational methods. These methods will integrate ideas from optimal transport, scientific machine learning, and stochastic methods, along with the unique structure of kinetic equations. The project also includes the training of graduate students, contributing to the development of the next generation of computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>The project has two main objectives. The first is to develop and analyze learning-enhanced, structure-preserving particle methods for nonlinear partial differential equations, with a particular focus on plasma models. The methods will preserve both the Hamiltonian structure of the field terms and the dissipative nature of the collision. They are intended to complement existing particle-in-cell approaches for collisionless plasmas and to offer improvements in scalability and stability for collisional plasma simulations. The second objective is to design reduced-order methods for optimization problems constrained by kinetic equations. This will involve leveraging the multiscale nature of the equations or employing intelligent use of randomness. The proposed methods aim to meet the pressing need for efficient inverse solvers, particularly given the growing applications of kinetic theory to real-world problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cloud feedbacks are one of the largest uncertainties in future projections of global surface temperature and thus there is strong motivation for constraining these feedbacks. This project is focused on advancing understanding of the observed negative CRE in the East Pacific and Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs), addressing a gap in the current theory applicable mainly to the deep convective regions of the West Pacific and Indian Ocean where sea surface temperature gradients are weak and the CRE is close to neutral. The focus on oceanic ITCZs is motivated by the fact that the CRE for these regions contributes about 5% to the global CRE and has a larger magnitude than the estimated global energy imbalance. The negative CRE for oceanic ITCZ regions results from smaller anvil cloud areas relative to other deep convective regions of the Tropics, however little is known about what controls anvil cloud area in these regions. Thus, this project will also explore why a negative CRE is associated with small anvil cloud fraction in these regions. The study will use a combination of satellite observations and idealized modeling studies to address these issues. The project includes training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scholars, and developing a learning module for elementary and high school students, meeting the mandate of the U.S. National Science Foundation to prepare the next generation of scientists in service to society.<br/><br/>Beginning with the parameterization of the top of the atmosphere radiative flux from Hartmann et al. (2001), the project will investigate the hypotheses that the negative CRE in the oceanic ITCZ regions is due in part to differential energy export between the convective and non-convective regions associated with ocean circulation, as well as to the high albedo in the ITCZ subsidence regions resulting from the extensive stratocumulus clouds of the eastern subtropical oceans. The small convective cloud fraction relative to the subsidence cloud fraction is also suggested as a mechanism to amplify the CRE in these regions. The project will also investigate if the smaller anvil cloud fraction associated with oceanic ITCZs results from reduced cloud detrainment. These hypotheses will be tested using reanalyses and Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2) non-rotating, aquaplanet simulations with a slab ocean. Causal relationships regarding what controls the anvil cloud fraction will be tested using mechanism denial and forcing experiments with CESM2. An expected outcome of this project is an update to the Hartmann et al. (2001) parameterization more applicable throughout the Tropics, by including both the original ?shortwave? pathway through changes in albedo as well as a ?longwave? pathway dependent on cloud anvil fraction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unique exhibition draws from past submissions to the Gallery of Fluid Motion (GFM), a program founded in 1987 as part of the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) conference, to highlight unique images and videos of the aesthetics and science of contemporary fluid dynamics. The TGFM expands this stimulating experience by teaming with curators and museums to expose science and art to the general public audience. <br/><br/>For the third consecutive year, a selection of past GFM submissions have been transformed into an educational art exhibition designed to engage the senses and inspire a broader audience. The creators of the artworks on exhibit, ranging from photography and video to sculpture and sound, are created by scientists and artists and often combined with music. Their work enables us to ?see the invisible? and understand the ever-moving elements surrounding and affecting us in fluid flows. Several of the artworks are specifically connected to the Houston region?s deep ties to the oil and energy sectors, highlighting fluid motion in contexts such as drilling, refining, and atmospheric flow. Gases and liquids are in constant motion, advancing in seemingly chaotic ways, yet the flow images and videos in this exhibition offer a closer look, revealing elegant and poetic patterns amidst atmospheric turbulence. The first TGFM exhibit, Chaosmosis: Assigning Rhythm to the Turbulent, premiered in 2023 at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in Washington, DC.

The investigator aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of when simpler approximations can be effectively used, and to provide rigorous guarantees for their accuracy. The core challenge lies in the trade-off between model complexity (which is often necessary to capture the nuances of large datasets) and computational feasibility. While complex models offer rich descriptions, their computational demands can be prohibitive. The investigator proposes to explore whether simpler, approximated models can retain the essential features of their complex counterparts while significantly reducing computation time. Graduate students will be involved in this research.<br/><br/><br/>The research will concretely examine the validity of naive mean-field variational inference in several key areas where complex models are prevalent, which include (i) High-Dimensional Bayesian Regression (linear and logistic), (ii) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), (iii) Mixed Membership Models, and (iv) Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). For each of these examples, the investigator plans to develop tailored inference methods, and provide rigorous, quantified bounds on the errors introduced by these approximations. This will offer a clear understanding of the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. The overarching goal is to equip researchers using naive mean-field based variational inference with concrete guidelines on when and under what circumstances such methods can be reliably applied, and when they might fall short.

The interest of such waves ranges from the large-scale understanding of destructive ""rogue wave"" type solutions, to the small, explaining the structure of the familiar ""herringbone"" or ""crosshatched"" flow seen in narrow fast-moving streams. The interest of the mathematical tools needed to understand them is also broad, extending to the general class of ""relaxation systems"" appearing in a variety of physical applications from plasma dynamics to many-particle systems, in which complex physical systems move toward much simpler equilibrium dynamics under the influence of physical mechanisms. Though these have been widely studied, the treatment of shock discontinuities is still largely undeveloped; the techniques developed in this project are hoped to remove this bottleneck in the general theory. The planned activities have both theoretical and physical components, and involve collaboration with domestic and foreign colleagues, undergraduates, current and former graduate students, and postdocs. This is expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across fields and institutions, and to aid in the training of students and postdocs. It will also aid in the dissemination of results and techniques, which will be further accomplished by frequent presentations.<br/><br/>The project seeks to resolve the outstanding problems of nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of discontinuous inviscid periodic waves and multi-dimensional hydraulic shocks. Objectives are the development of new theoretical tools in order to treat unresolved questions of practical interest in shallow-water flow, extended thermodynamics, and other models involving relaxation. Methods include a blend of finite- and infinite-dimensional dynamical systems tools with specialized techniques coming from the theory of shock waves and hyperbolic conservation laws. The problems investigated as part of the project involve interesting and nonstandard mathematical issues addressing puzzles from physical applications. For example, successful treatment of nonlinear stability of discontinuous periodic waves would represent a major theoretical advance in both shock and modulation theory while resolving long-standing questions on roll wave behavior in shallow water flow/hydraulic engineering. Likewise, the rigorous mathematical description of herringbone patterns and general hyperbolic bifurcation would mark important theoretical advances. The use of variable-coefficient Kreiss symmetrizers/pseudodifferential damping estimates for the treatment of turning points and regularity in multiple dimensions may be particularly consequential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, experiments involving radiative heat transfer have been limited by a focus on two-body systems. This CAREER program will explore the potential of systems containing more than two objects (i.e., multi-body systems) to lead to new physical and transport behaviors and, as a result, enable new applications in domains of national importance such as aerospace electronics, energy conversion technology, and information processing. To create these new technologies, it is essential to experimentally study and understand nanoscale radiative heat transfer between multiple objects and explore its use for improving heat exchange and thermal control. Thus, a primary outcome of this research will be a novel technique that enables the study of nanoscale radiative heat transfer among multiple objects. In addition to providing the fundamental knowledge necessary to advance thermal control at the nanoscale, this program will implement an innovative educational platform that promotes practical workforce development in academia by bridging the gap between academic work and industrial problems and stimulates curiosity among K-12 students in exploring engineering careers. <br/><br/>This CAREER program will apply the physics of radiative transport in multi-bodies to solve thermal control problems in nanodevices. Specifically, this research will experimentally uncover the governing physics that drive electromagnetic waves-matter interactions in multi-body systems to identify the contributing factors in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT). This work will provide new knowledge critical to the development of next-generation nanodevices by: (1) understanding the effect of structural factors on NFRHT in multi-bodies and (2) elucidating the role of multi-body physics in NFRHT for active thermal management. Significant structural and material factors in the spatial confinement of evanescent photons between multi-bodies will be identified through precision heat transfer measurements. Findings will provide in-depth understanding on how multiple interactive objects within micro/nano-dimensions impact radiative transport mechanisms?knowledge that will have far-reaching implications for advancing the thermal management of state-of-the-art high-power systems in industrial and technological applications.

The GCE LTER researchers evaluate how environmental conditions (e.g., sea level, temperature, storms and hurricanes) and human activities (e.g., land use) affect the properties of estuaries (e.g., salinity, flooding patterns), and how that in turn affects wetlands and their ability to provide food and refuge for fish, shellfish and birds, to protect the shoreline from storms, to help to keep the water clean, and to store carbon, all of which have significant implications for the US economy. Many of the changes that are occurring are affecting not just average conditions, but also their fluctuations and extremes (e.g., variability). For example, not only has the average high tide level increased over the past decade, but the number of extreme flooding events has also increased, both of which have the potential to lead to wetland loss through drowning. During this award, the research team will conduct studies to systematically evaluate 1) whether we can improve our predictions of ecological responses by considering variability in environmental conditions, and 2) the use of variability as an early indicator of underlying environmental stress. The findings from this research will be important for predicting the long-term survival of coastal wetlands in a time of global change. In addition to research, the GCE program works with teachers and students, coastal managers, citizen scientists, and the general public to enhance scientific literacy and improve our understanding of coastal ecosystems.<br/><br/>The GCE LTER is based at the University of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island, Georgia, and has a robust program of long-term field observations, experiments, remote sensing, and modeling designed to understand wetland ecosystem functioning. GCE LTER researchers will build on this foundation with an overlay of new efforts focused on variability. Objective (Obj) 1 is to characterize spatial and temporal patterns in mean and variability of drivers and responses by measuring external drivers (e.g., sea level), marsh and estuarine conditions, and the wetland biophysical template, and to integrate these dynamics via modeling. Obj 2 is to evaluate linkages between external drivers and ecological responses, and determine whether assessing the variability of abiotic drivers improves predictions of those responses. This will be done by analyzing long-term data, conducting field campaigns in areas with different variability in salinity and inundation, and conducting complementary mechanistic experiments to quantify the effects of driver variability (e.g., salinity). Obj. 3 is to assess disturbances and their effects on patterns of variability in ecological responses by tracking the effects of natural disturbances in the field along with ongoing experimental manipulations. Obj. 4 is to evaluate how ecological properties change across abiotic gradients, and determine whether variability increases near habitat transitions. This will be done using remote sensing, sampling across gradients of salinity and inundation, and establishing long-term monitoring sites in forested areas to track upland marsh migration. Obj. 5 is to determine the mechanisms by which coastal wetlands respond to changing drivers and assess whether variability informs this understanding. This will be done in three ways: by conducting statistical analyses relating key ecosystem variables (e.g., net ecosystem exchange, plant biomass) to drivers (salinity, inundation, temperature); by using remote sensing to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in the mean and variability of marsh productivity and their relationship to variability in climate drivers; and by synthesizing results to describe net daytime production and C stocks and predict how they might change in response to future conditions. The GCE education and outreach program will provide K-12 teachers with research experience that can be shared in the classroom, along with school visits. It will offer research opportunities through undergraduate internships, and run web-based courses for graduate students. The program will initiate a citizen science effort to delineate high tide flooding events, and will partner with the Georgia Coastal Research Council to exchange information with coastal managers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There, icebergs break off, drifting towards lower latitudes and warmer waters. Along the way the icebergs melt and the rock fragments sink to the seafloor, leaving behind a trail of these rock fragments called ice rafted debris. Ice rafted debris accumulates at the bottom of the ocean and over time preserves a record of activity at their source, the Antarctic ice sheet. In this study investigators will use sediment cores recovered in the Indian Ocean by the Ocean Drilling Program to reconstruct the accumulation of ice rafted debris over time. The drill site is about 500 miles north of the Antarctic continent, and in the path of the ice bergs that it sheds. When looking at the variations in ice rafted debris over time, the team will obtain a record of changes in the glacial activity of the Antarctic ice sheet through time. The study is motivated by the mystery surrounding changes in glacial activity in response to changes in the shape of Earth?s orbit around the sun, the wobble of its axis, and the degree of the tilt of the Earth?s axis, the so-called Milankovitch cycles. For a period of time between about 1.2 and 1.6 million years ago, it is not clear if ice sheet growth and melt responded to changes in incoming solar energy related to changes in the shape of the orbit or to changes in its tilt toward or away from the sun. This study will contribute data to help understand how these external mechanisms cause variations in the size and behavior of Antarctic ice sheets. Investigators will conduct this research alongside a number of undergraduate students and one graduate student. Records of ice rafted debris provide an ideal teaching tool as they are reasonably easy to assemble by students independently (after initial training) and thus provide students with a sense of self-reliance and self-confidence, increasing their motivation to remain in a STEM related field. Thus, ice rafted debris is an ideal proxy to teach students about paleoclimate and paleoceanography. Broader impacts activities include training and mentoring undergraduate students and a graduate student, outreach with a local middle school, and efforts to expand access in STEM.<br/><br/>Legacy Ocean Drilling Program Site 745B - drilled during Leg 119 in 1988 south of the polar front in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean - provides a rare opportunity to study paleoclimate at the full orbital scale back into the late Miocene (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1989) in a vastly understudied region of the world ocean. Investigators propose to construct records of ice rafted debris (IRD) to infer Antarctic ice margin dynamics during the early Pleistocene (~1.1-1.8 Ma) and during specific late Pleistocene interglacial intervals (Marine Isotope Stages 1,5, 7, 11, and 15). Recently, orbital-scale resolution records of biogenic opal and magnetic susceptibility have been tuned to the Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) oxygen isotope stack unlocking the site?s full potential for paleoceanographic reconstructions. With the early Pliocene record, the team will test the hypothesis that the dominance of 41 kyr ice volume fluctuations observed during this interval of time is an artifact of the oxygen isotope proxy. Precession-related variations in the IRD record would support interhemispheric cancellation of the precession signal in oxygen isotope records. Dominance of obliquity would suggest that fluctuations in marine-terminating ice sheets did occur on this time scale. With the late Pleistocene interglacial intervals, which correspond to different amplitudes of obliquity versus precession in insolation forcing, investigators will examine the response of marine terminating ice margins under these different conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A comprehensive understanding of how firn densifies into solid ice is important for several reasons: (1) to interpret ice sheet mass balance changes from remote-sensing observations; (2) to determine how the microstructural evolution of firn contributes to the resulting ice sheet microstructure and its ice flow rates; and (3) most importantly for better interpretation of ice-core paleoclimate records by understanding how air becomes entrapped in the firn, and ultimately in the ice. Currently, firn densification is not fully understood, and a physics-based model based on experimentally-observed deformation mechanisms is needed to improve our firn estimates for the important applications described above. This research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the compaction and microstructural evolution of polar firn by performing mechanical testing, and characterization of the resulting microstructure on firn cores from four different locations at Taylor Dome, Antarctica. Results from each of these firn cores will provide valuable information about how firn microstructure, and its impact on densification, evolves under varying environmental conditions outside the range of existing datasets. The research will involve a PhD student and several undergraduates.<br/><br/>Densification of polar firn involves several different mechanisms including pressure sintering, plastic deformation, grain rearrangement, and, near the surface, temperature gradient metamorphism due to water vapor transport. A key step towards a physics-based firn model is understanding how the microstructure impacts the dominant deformation mechanism(s) at different depths in the firn column. This project will provide valuable data needed to answer this question by performing creep tests and characterizing the microstructural evolution under creep loading on firn cores drilled to pore close-off at four different locations at Taylor Dome, Antarctica. Each of the four firn-core sites vary in their annual accumulation rate (2 cm.a-1, 4 cm.a-1, 8 cm.a-1, 25 cm.a-1), creating different microstructure-depth profiles. We will use a unique combination of X-ray micro-CT imaging coupled with high-resolution imaging of the evolved microstructure using a scanning electron microscope equipped with electron backscatter diffraction, that will provide 3-D orientation information. In addition, we will examine the local microchemistry, particularly around bonds between grains, using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the SEM and Raman spectroscopy in an optical imaging system. These results will allow for a full analysis of the role firn microstructure has on densification. This work will ultimately be used to improve the Community Firn Model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, doctors and nurses often struggle to accurately determine the level of consciousness in approximately 30?40% of the most serious cases of brain injury, and around 70% die after families decide to stop life support. This is a problem, in part, because doctors lack sufficiently reliable tools to measure consciousness and predict recovery. This technology addresses this problem by providing a tool to track a patient?s brain and motor activity patterns, which indicate the level of responsiveness. The goal is to better track how the brain ?wakes up? and use the information to guide treatment decisions and recovery plans. This technology may serve as a confirmatory method for neuro-evaluation and help to detect deviations from the expected recovery trajectory in hospitals, emergency services, and nursing homes. In addition, this technology may enable healthcare teams to determine the effects of oversedation or undersedation, and may provide better outcomes and save lives for patients with brain injury.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a medical device monitoring tool that measures and tracks consciousness levels and their fluctuations. This technology is based on a repeated, temporally discrete, dynamic cortical pattern that aligns with autonomic tone and is reliably associated with single motor changes evident in the recovery of consciousness from anesthesia and brain injury coma models in rodents. This dynamic pattern, termed arousal units (AUs), contains distinctive cortical patterns that reliably synchronize with transient shifts of breathing frequency and single motor behavioral changes that evolve as rodents and humans reach a state of wakefulness. Oscillatory patterns within AUs may be transformed into indices, making it possible to quantify consciousness levels in minutes, and can be used to distinguish voluntary from erratic behaviors. In addition, this technology reveals fluctuations that can quantitatively track the transition from a reflexive state to a state of awareness and the transition from one state of consciousness to another. This device may benefit physicians and nurses that currently perform neuro-evaluations using qualitative methods to make informed decisions about the need for additional tests or treatments. A monitoring tool that measures and tracks consciousness may reduce the risk of patient mortality and improve patient recovery and outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research addresses a problem with broad implications: reconstructing ancient ecosystem food webs. Food webs represent ecosystem energy flow and are important to ecosystem functioning and services for human societies. Human influence on ecosystems is expanding rapidly, but data on ecosystems? responses to rapid or extreme impacts is limited. The fossil record contains many examples. Generally, paleontological reconstruction relies upon modern food web properties, but this correspondence breaks down after mass extinctions. Recovering ecosystems deviate significantly from expectations of how ecosystems function. This project will examine marine ecosystems spanning the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, 251 million years ago, when 80% of species became extinct. The project will reconstruct the ways in which ancient ecosystems adapted to extreme disturbances by using fossils collected in the field and deposited in museum collections combined with high performance computing analyses. The project will support and train numerous students and an early career scientist in analytical and museum curation skills.  <br/> 	<br/>Reconstructing ancient ecosystems relies on models of interspecific interactions, operating under a uniformitarian assumption that the principles determining interactions remain constant through evolutionary time. The resulting probabilistic food webs provide insights into the robustness of past ecosystems. This project challenges the uniformitarian assumption by proposing a framework within which to test alternative assumptions of species properties following extreme ecological disturbances. This project will examine Permian-Triassic communities, including mass extinction-spanning and recovery communities, questioning whether communities immediately after mass extinctions were structured and functioned differently from those during environmentally quiescent times. The project will mobilize new and existing fossil collections, as well as offer paleontological training to community college and high school students.

Diabetes is a growing health issue among companion animals, with hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats affected in the United States alone. Current treatments often require daily insulin injections, which can be stressful, expensive, and difficult for pet owners to manage. The technology addresses that challenge by creating a simpler, more effective solution that helps regulate blood sugar levels with just one treatment. The therapy works by helping the animal?s body produce a natural protein that improves how it uses insulin and protects against damage caused by diabetes. The scale of the problem is significant, with the number of diabetic pets increasing and limited treatment options available. This therapy has the potential to reduce long-term veterinary costs and make diabetes care more accessible. Early results also show improvements in both body and brain health, supporting the potential for wider therapeutic benefits. The project also looks at how this treatment can be scaled up for use in veterinary clinics, filling a major gap in long-term care for pets with chronic diseases.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a gene therapy platform designed to express a molecule with antioxidant and tissue-repair properties. The therapy targets metabolic dysfunction in diabetic animals by enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing weight gain, and protecting against diabetic neuropathy. The approach involves a single intramuscular injection of a viral vector engineered to deliver the gene encoding this protein, resulting in sustained systemic expression. Preclinical studies in diet-induced diabetic mice demonstrate significant improvements in glucose regulation and cognitive function, with plasma protein levels maintained for several months post-injection. This method contrasts with existing treatments that rely on frequent insulin administration, offering a long-acting, low-maintenance alternative. The therapy?s design allows for scalability to larger animals, such as cats and dogs, using standard veterinary injection techniques. The scientific innovation lies in the use of a gene-based delivery system to achieve durable therapeutic effects from a single administration, reducing the need for ongoing intervention. Users benefit from improved disease control, reduced treatment burden, and lower risk of complications such as hypoglycemia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current ADCs operate in the electrical domain and have strict trade-offs between speed, precision, and power due to the nature of electronic architectures. This technology is a light-based solution utilizing photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to address this challenge. To date, no photonic ADCs are available on the market due to fabrication and energy consumption issues associated with existing methods. The technology may provide the high-speed data processing required by artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IOT) applications and may satisfy the need for energy-efficient, high-performance solutions across many industries.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of photonic analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The technology is focused on two approaches: all-optical passive (zero-power) and high-speed electro-optical converters using scalable and Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible photonic integrated platforms. The designs incorporate photonic integrated resonators modulated via thermo-optic or electro-optic effects to trigger a single output channel, selected based on the power of an analog input signal. The output channel is then guided through photonic circuitry to photodetectors that identify each binary bit. Both methods are expected to demonstrate efficient performance, CMOS compatibility, and scalability that surpasses conventional electronic approaches. Current ADC technologies are impractical due to energy speed requirements. The ADC technology addresses these challenges as it is also light-based, and avoids electro-optical conversions entirely. This technology may help to unlock the full potential of any photonic computing chip.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ergodic theory, a subfield of dynamics, focuses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed when the group of symmetries is non-amenable which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. One such tool is the weak local (or Benjamini-Schramm) limit. These limits formalize the asymptotic local behavior of large, possibly random, mathematical objects. This project is concerned with fundamental questions: when do these limits exist (for natural families of low-dimensional geometric objects) and given an infinite mathematical object (such as a manifold or network), can it be identified as the weak local limit of finite objects? <br/><br/>This research project has three main objectives.<br/><br/>1) In recent work with M. Chapman, A. Lubotzky and T. Vidick, the primary investigator (PI) settled the Aldous-Lyons Conjecture in the negative: there exist non-sofic unimodular random graphs. These are random rooted graphs which cannot be approximated by finite graphs in the Benjamini-Schramm sense despite satisfying the Mass Transport Principle. One goal of this project is to find explicit non-sofic unimodular random graphs which are either hyperbolic, the 1-skeleton of a CAT(0) cubical complex, falsify the analog of Gottschalk?s Conjecture regarding cellular automata or which have isomorphic Bernoulli shift spaces with different entropies. These may all be useful in finding non-sofic groups, a long-sought-after goal.<br/><br/>2) In recent work with K. Rafi and H. Vallejos, the PI proved that Masur-Veech random translation surfaces have a weak local (Benjamini-Schramm) limit as genus tends to infinity. The main tool is an elaboration on the surgery techniques of Eskin-Masur-Zorich. The PI intends to build on this by developing multi-parameter Siegel-Veech Theory and proving weak local limits of hyperbolic surfaces decorated with measured laminations, abelian differentials, quasi-Fuchsian embeddings and so on.  The PI will investigate connections between these objects and Gaussian analytic functions, SLE curves, and the Curien-Warner Markovian triangulation. <br/><br/>3) In celebrated work, J. Friedman proved that random d-regular graphs admit an almost maximal spectral gap with high probability as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Recent work of the PI and student A. Embry generalize this to the degree-regular block model (DRBM). A third objective of this project to extend this to generalize the Bordenave-Collins Theorem (proving strong convergence of random permutation representations of free groups) to strong convergence of a related block model version. If successful, this may show that Koopman representations of measure-preserving actions of free groups determine C*-algebras that are matricial field: they can be strongly approximated through maps to finite-dimensional algebras. It should also determine precise spectral properties of this large and varied class of sparse random graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices can track various aspects of daily life, including activity, sleep patterns, location, and physiological signals such as heart rate. This tracking enables the design and development of intervention systems that can deliver timely, personalized support. The systems will help a person to better manage their health outcomes, for example, reducing stress or improving physical activity. However, knowing when a person can receive, process, and use the support in their daily lives to enable long-term sustainable engagement is a major challenge. Factors such as a person's current activity, location, emotions, motivation, and even how much effort they think it will take to engage can influence how willing they are to interact with an intervention. This project aims to address these challenges by creating smart systems that optimize how interventions are delivered and by determining the best time, type, and device for providing support. The project will thus improve engagement and promote sustainable behavior change. The project proposes new approaches to understanding a person's behavioral states using smartphones and wearable technology. The project will also evaluate how these states impact how a person interacts with interventions. The findings and tools from this project will enable behavioral scientists and intervention designers to create new types of personalized digital health interventions. Research activities will include training graduate students, integrating findings into courses on data science and personal health informatics, and hosting hands-on workshops for intervention designers.<br/><br/>This project advances the field of digital health by combining human-centered computing, machine learning, and mobile sensing to enhance just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). The project includes three key thrusts: The first part focuses on developing a comprehensive framework to represent the context of a person as a multivariate state that includes both physical (for example, location and activity) and emotional states (for example, arousal or stress). The project will also develop a hybrid approach of Dynamic Bayesian Networks and Hidden Semi-Markov Models to model current context and predict expected future contextual states. The second thrust of the project seeks to understand and predict the impact of contextual states on receptivity to interventions and develop a multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm to leverage the context, receptivity, intervention burdens, and expected effectiveness of the intervention to determine ""what,"" ""when,"" and ""how"" to deliver interventions to maximize intervention engagement and effectiveness. Finally, the project will develop an extensible state-of-receptivity framework that enables behavior scientists to design and implement effective adaptive interventions by leveraging the optimization algorithms and balancing intervention burden and effectiveness across diverse platforms. The project will evaluate the performance, efficacy, and usability of all tools, methods, and algorithms through human subject studies and release them as open-source resources to contribute to the broader digital health, ubiquitous computing, and human-centered computing communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing alternatives to traditional antibiotics is critical for addressing this global challenge. This collaborative project supports fundamental research to develop a new type of antimicrobial nanoparticle to combat  antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These nanoparticles are unique in that they display a non-uniform coating of hydrophobic and positively charged molecules. Such nanoparticles are expected to act through novel antibiotic mechanisms that are less likely to cause acquired drug resistance in bacteria. The research team will combine experiments with computational modeling to elucidate how interactions of these nanoparticles with bacteria depend on the non-uniform surface chemistry of nanoparticles and the cell wall chemistry of bacteria. The mechanistic understanding from this study will guide the rational design of antimicrobial nanoparticles against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. By integrating nanoscience research with educational and outreach activities this collaborative project outlines interdisciplinary approaches to promote critical thinking and increase diversity in STEM. These approaches include the development of introductory undergraduate courses that integrate science teaching with art, a collaborative outreach project to K-12 students in rural areas, and training of the next generation of researchers, especially underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>Developing broad-spectrum antimicrobial nanoparticles is challenging because a single nanoparticle design cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution effective against all bacteria. Instead, nanoparticles whose antimicrobial activity can be tuned to match the bacterial diversity are needed.

This project will develop theoretical methods for the analysis of these datasets. As the scale of connectomes grow, such methods will be increasingly important. This project will accelerate the development of approaches that are capable of scaling to large brains and that are robust to the heterogeneity and complexity present in real nervous systems, while also facilitating the recruitment and training of interdisciplinary scientists with strong analytical skills to work with connectome datasets and build new models.<br/><br/>There is a relative lack of techniques for exploiting connectomic data for hypothesis generation beyond manual examination of individual connections between previously identified neurons with hypothesized functions. Given the orders of magnitude difference in scale between previously available and more recently released connectome datasets (?300 neurons in C. elegans vs. ?140,000 in the adult Drosophila brain, for instance), moving from manual approaches to statistical descriptions and analyses whole-brain connectivity is critical. This project's research involves two approaches: analysis of whole-brain sensorimotor pathways and their relationship to behavior, and structural analysis techniques to identify interpretable low-dimensional organization in connectome data. In the short term, these approaches will accelerate investigations of the connection between structure and function in fruit flies, in particular how diverse behavioral responses across contexts are generated by a common wiring diagram. In the longer term, the principles that we uncover will lay the groundwork for applications to larger datasets in other organisms, including mammals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the work is rooted in abstract mathematics, it has real-world applications in areas like medicine, environmental science, and engineering. Better understanding how random growth and movement work can help us manage diseases, improve materials, and design smarter technologies. This research not only advances our knowledge of mathematics but also contributes to solving real problems that affect people?s lives. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the mathematical study of random motion in random environments, with particular emphasis on models of random growth. The principal investigator has developed and applied a key analytical tool--Busemann functions--to a broad class of stochastic models, including directed and undirected percolation, random polymers, and random walks in random environments, across discrete, semi-discrete, and continuous frameworks. Notably, this includes work on the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, a central object in the study of stochastic growth. Busemann functions provide deep structural insights: they solve energy-entropy variational formulas, describe infinite-volume Gibbs measures in positive temperature regimes, and characterize geodesic rays in zero-temperature settings. They also yield eternal solutions and stationary distributions in associated random dynamical systems (RDS), playing a central role in understanding their stability properties and in identifying shock locations in inviscid or zero-temperature models. This project aims to extend this framework to a wider class of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equations--both viscous and inviscid, with time-dependent or time-independent Hamiltonians--and to resolve several open problems that emerged from prior work.

They often have simple descriptions; for example, a randomly chosen tiling of the chessboard with domino tiles is one of them. Yet, as the domain that is being tiled becomes large, such systems exhibit intricate behavior and serve as mathematical models for phase transitions seen in nature. More concretely, the experimentally observed phenomenon of roughening of crystals at temperatures close to absolute zero has similar phenomenology. Mathematical analysis of dimer models is challenging, and it requires a diverse set of sophisticated tools from different branches of mathematics including algebra, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. For a broad range of planar domains, these tools will ultimately make it possible to analyze the large scale behavior at a very fine resolution, offering key insights into a much wider range of probabilistic and physical systems. <br/><br/>The proposal is dedicated to dimer models on growing planar graphs with periodically varying edge weights.

Establishing an explicit correspondence between periodic dimer models and Yang-Baxter solvable Solid-On-Solid models of statistical physics is essential, and this bridge will provide access to new algebraic structures that in turn will yield asymptotic results. Another key connection is to the theory of Riemann surfaces, whose geometry is essential to describing the limiting behavior of the models.

Using this paradigm can result in unprecedented acceleration of scientific applications that process large datasets, have data dependent performance characteristics, and have non uniform data access patterns.

However, natural proteins are often not ideal for these practical uses. Protein engineering, a field that aims to design proteins with improved or novel functions, has transformed industries by creating tailored proteins. While traditional approaches, such as the Nobel Prize-recognized directed evolution method, have been remarkably successful in numerous protein engineering applications, they are typically slow, costly, and resource-intensive. This project seeks to advance protein engineering by combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) methods with advanced laboratory automation. By harnessing the power of AI to predict and design protein sequences and integrating it with an automated experimental platform, this research aims to greatly accelerate the discovery of new proteins, offering immense potential across multiple scientific domains with significant commercial and societal impact on medicine, biotechnology, energy, agriculture, chemical manufacturing, consumer products, and more.<br/><br/><br/>This project introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach leveraging recent AI breakthroughs in large language models and generative models, to guide protein function analysis and protein engineering, unlocking an unparalleled efficiency for functional protein discovery. The research focuses on developing new AI techniques tailored to the unique challenges of protein engineering, such as sparse data and the need to balance multiple complex protein properties. By leveraging protein evolution insights and generative modeling, the AI system will guide the design of functional proteins with enhanced properties. An integrated automated Biofoundry will design, create and test AI-designed proteins, validating and then refining the design as needed, enabling a high-throughput, closed-loop discovery process. Beyond advancing the field of protein engineering, the project's algorithmic innovations will contribute to foundational research in AI and computing, with the potential for broad applications in other scientific and technological domains.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project research will help robots learn like humans do - learning on the job. The new system will enable home robots to learn new skills from human teachers quickly and on their own. It will also allow them to adapt fast to new tasks through smart planning. To get young students excited about robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), the team will develop teaching programs for K-12 students from different backgrounds. The project will also create new college classes that combine AI and robotics to prepare students for future jobs.<br/><br/>Robot learning on its own is challenging in real world scenarios - robots must learn individual skills as parts of longer, more complex tasks. For example, learning to cut vegetables requires first learning to grasp knives well. This research will develop a new robot system where intelligent planning helps guide the robot to learn. The system helps the robot find missing skills and design situations that help the robot to practice these skills. The system also uses these learned skills to help the robot plan for more complex tasks. The system has three main components: (1) learning new skills with a symbolic planner as guidance; (2) efficient learning from occasional human guidance when needed; and (3) fast adaptation to new tasks through intelligently combining learned skills. The team will test the system in simulated environments and on real robots used in home care research centers. The focus will be on daily household tasks that need long-term adaptation.

For this project, an interdisciplinary team of scientists will complete field, laboratory, and scaling studies to improve understanding of soil processes and ultimately how we predict, prevent, manage and remediate soil and water contamination. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students. The outcomes include curriculum and outreach materials for science students and teachers at regional secondary schools, as well as improved pedagogy.<br/><br/>The hypothesis-driven project will determine if soil layers, lenses and fractures are hotspots for C and N cycling.

Finally, the research will explore how these two factors (soil properties and soil wetness) work together to control soil C and N content from the local to landscape scales. The project leverages ongoing monitoring and modeling at the Texas Water Observatory. Field sampling includes observations of water content, temperature, carbon, nitrogen, and microbial mRNA and DNA in soils during wet and dry conditions. Controlled laboratory experiments will be used to study layered, lensed, and fractured soil systems.

For instance, a user executing a web search will increasingly rely on LLM-based systems to summarize their search results, rather than viewing individual web pages, and they might use LLM-based systems to ?talk to? long documents like financial reports, rather than reading them in their entirety. To support these new paradigms, it is important that an LLM be able to generate responses that are factual, informative and safe. However, satisfying these criteria is not sufficient: a response should also be at the right level of abstraction or detail, in the right format, creative where appropriate, and aligned with other user needs. Current practice has neglected evaluation of these more subtle factors. This project proposes to address these shortcomings by identifying a set of ?evaluation concepts? to indicate the kinds of areas where LLMs are failing, like ?lack of detail in a list.? The project will then develop technology for automatically evaluating and improving LLM responses according to these concepts.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve the evaluation and the functionality of LLMs in two ways. First, the project will discover a concept taxonomy and learn how to evaluate LLM responses according to the concepts in that taxonomy. This process will necessitate advances in reward models, which are themselves LLMs, customized to reliably score responses. Second, these reward models are applied to actually improve the LLMs? responses. Specifically, the project will curate training data exhibiting the correct kinds of behavior for each concept, enabling training of LLMs that do better on those concepts. Finally, the project will develop methods for iteratively improving responses using our reward models. The project will open-source the concept taxonomy and reward models that will outperform closed-source, proprietary models. These models will enable the public to have a better sense of the performance of LLM systems across a variety of applications, and will drive the open-source community to build stronger, more reliable LLM systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The distinction between surfaces and volumes, however, depends on the scale at which we observe these materials. For example, if we examine a cloud up close, we see that it is made of countless water droplets with their own tiny surfaces, even though from a distance it may appear as a hazy volume. Similarly, when viewing a forest from far away, we cannot make out fine details, but zooming in reveals a tangle of individual branches and leaves. These details cannot simply be discarded when modeling appearance from afar, however, because variations in shape and structure at all scales influence how materials look. For computational reasons, current methods in computer graphics and related fields typically treat surfaces and volumes as fundamentally different: efficient techniques exist for rendering surface-like or volume-like materials, but having to choose one or the other makes it difficult to accurately represent how light interacts with these materials across scales. This project will develop new ways to model and simulate the interaction of light with such materials, regardless of scale. The outcomes will have broad impact within computer graphics for applications like moviemaking, industrial design, and architecture, as well as scientific domains like remote sensing, medical imaging, and nuclear engineering, which require accurate simulations of how light or particles scatter within complex or disordered materials.<br/><br/>This project will introduce a fundamentally different approach by treating shape and appearance together, as a unified problem. Using Gaussian processes to describe the geometry of materials will allow the model to determine, at any viewing scale, which features should be considered part of the main shape and which should be treated as finer-scale variations that are only preserved in the statistical sense. This will enable accurate simulations and visualizations of complex materials at any scale, and will more generally provide a rigorous mathematical way to incorporate correlated uncertainty in transport modeling. To remain competitive with specialized techniques, the project will consider how to simplify to existing, faster methods at either extreme of the surface-volume continuum, and how to develop efficient Monte Carlo light transport simulation techniques that leverage this framework. This will have broad impact in any discipline that requires simulating the transport of neutral particles in correlated disorder across arbitrary scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the researchers will develop a biological coating system that can be applied for corrosion control of civil infrastructure.

Across all three years the collaborations will engage EPSCoR jurisdictions, federal science agencies, established and startup businesses, and institutions of higher education to collaboratively identify data, measures and tools capable of strengthening links between science investments, economic activity, and jobs. Analyses will be tuned to produce forward-looking insights into likely occupational and skills demand for new technologies as they go to full production. The results could significantly influence how regional science investments are made and optimized across the nation, driving increased economic competitiveness and productivity by deepening our understanding of the crucial link between research, technology driven workplace changes, jobs, skills and earnings.<br/><br/>This new collaboratively developed empirical framework, data, and infrastructure will, for the first time, directly engage state institutions, data users, and producers to quantify relationships among research investments, regional job markets, local workforce dynamics, and other key economic outcomes of technology investment. A key IofI contribution stems from its integration of many constituencies and datasets including science and technology metadata, data from universities, state workforce and state higher education agencies, and private job postings information on emerging skills data. The IofI project, anchored on AI investments, will build new tools for an essential emerging sector of the economy that is of pressing interest at the regional, state, and national levels, but that can scale to other technologies. The tools will provide local, timely and actionable information built on comprehensive statistically valid data designed by and for relevant user communities. The insights and outcomes from this research project can help inform science policy and make significant intellectual contributions to multiple fields of research and practice.<br/>Investment in this project is both consistent and well aligned with the goals and broad strategic objectives of NSF TIP. This investment is consistent with agency?s goals and the scientific and technological community?s interest in understanding how investment to produce innovation in critical and emerging technologies drive economic outcomes of relevance to all Americans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the Aprahamian group employs halogen bonding to strengthen the interactions between hydrazone-based dopants and the LC host with the goal of improving the chiral information transfer between them, thus enabling precise tuning of the color reflected from the LC surface. The group also develops new chiral architectures, including macrocyclic hydrazones and C3-symmetric scaffolds such as tribenzotriquinacene, to expand the design space and capabilities available to materials scientists.

From what we know about human learning, it is clear that deliberate practice, appropriate scaffolding, and timely feedback are needed for learning to be effective. Practical implementation of such features requires substantial investment from domain experts or instructors, which makes it difficult to provide these opportunities at scale. The overarching goal of this project is to make expertise sharing more efficient through helping experts create example-based intelligent tutors. The research team will partner with other universities, local community colleges, and public schools to test the developed tools, which will then be made publicly available. Through this work, the project will make it easier to develop effective training programs that scale well to millions of workers, improving both their own opportunities and the U.S. economy as a whole. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the teaching and learning of complex problem-solving tasks, e.g. ?Identify a recent economic phenomenon that involves market failure, explain which type of market failure it is, and propose a solution.? To capture the expertise behind such tasks, the project introduces a ?Checklist with Examples? approach, which outlines the key criteria a solution must meet. Four main activities guide this project. Thrust 1 involves creating example-based intelligent tutors for task domains that already have detailed checklists. This will produce human-AI collaborative techniques, and a platform (?Exemplify?) for instructors to gather examples that meet specific criteria. Instructors can find these examples from prior students? homework submissions using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based methods or generate them directly with Large Language Models (LLM). Exemplify also helps instructors create scaffolding exercises such as multiple-choice questions or example-annotation tasks with automated feedback. Thrust 2 involves performing randomized controlled classroom experiments to evaluate the resulting example-based intelligent tutors. Thrust 3 involves developing a feedback engine using the checklists and the examples collected earlier. The engine provides students with automated formative feedback as they work on open-ended problem-solving tasks. Thrust 4 develops a low-cost proxy method for cognitive task analysis by having LLM agents simulate novice learners and generate solutions.

Such events also cause severe disruptions to agriculture, infrastructure, energy delivery and use, industrial activity, and fisheries. To better protect life, property, and food sources, it is in the national interest to provide policymakers and local and regional stakeholders with the reliable information they need to make informed decisions. The provision of such information requires Earth system model simulations that can run fast at increasingly finer scales on emerging computational platforms. In addition, advancing the scientific understanding of the processes occurring at these scales and how they feed back to the larger scales is needed. The project aims to address this Earth system modeling challenge by advancing the capabilities of one of the most widely used Earth system models through the creation of optimized configurations of its ocean component that can run efficiently on advanced supercomputers. The project will make a crucial contribution to the Earth system model, providing critical information at local and regional scales and enhancing the planet's resilience to natural hazards. The project will support the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the broader research, policymaking, and stakeholder communities, through specific classes, tutorials, and workshops.<br/><br/>The project creates an innovative cyberinfrastructure for the latest version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM3), particularly for its ocean component, Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6). It enables new high-resolution (HR; ~10-25 km) and ultra-HR (~3-5 km) frontier applications and science, thus broadening CESM3's use cases down to the kilometer scale. Specifically, the project aims to create Graphics Processor Unit (GPU)-enabled and optimized configurations of MOM6, anticipating the availability of more GPU-based systems in the future. One of the cyberinfrastructure innovations is the introduction of the AMReX software framework within MOM6.

To make sense of this data, the scientific enterprise relies on new computational methods and computing infrastructure to realize new insights. In other words, the computational methods used for large scale data analysis are now tools of the scientific community as they are central to the knowledge generation process. This project aims to address a major limitation in large scale data analysis by designing and implementing novel methods that employ computational storage devices, which combine the storage inside of a computer with a configurable processor that resides on the storage device itself. This project will yield new insights into the efficient use of these computational storage devices and will demonstrate how they can be used to remedy the challenges faced in several scientific domains. The project will benefit society by training students in the use of cutting edge technologies that are of national importance and which have great potential to bolster the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>Computational storage devices are an emerging technology for accelerating large scale data intensive computations because they combine storage with field programmable gate arrays. Relocating computational tasks from the host processor to a computational storage device eliminates data movement between the computational storage device and the central processor unit's main memory over the bandwidth constrained system interconnect, thereby reducing traffic, saving energy, and reducing latency. Using this paradigm can result in unprecedented acceleration of scientific applications that process large datasets, have data dependent performance characteristics, and have non uniform data access patterns. This project will conduct a design space exploration for selected computational tasks in order to identify the kernels and design parameters that provide the best acceleration for a system with multi core CPUs equipped with computational storage devices. The project will design and implement several indexing data structures having a wide range of properties that make them suitable across numerous application scenarios that are optimized for computational storage devices. The project will create and disseminate a user friendly programming framework that provides data parallel primitives for computational storage devices including map, reduce, filter and join, and collective communication functions including scatter, gather, and all to all communication. Furthermore, using our framework and the indexing data structures, we will design and implement range queries, similarity searches, and joins on points and polygon objects which are highly valuable for several scientific fields including astronomy, heliophysics, geoscience, and other geospatial domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to establish a modeling framework for addressing pressing neuroscience-related questions, and to demonstrate this capability by tackling clinically relevant research questions related to atypical neural activity in autism. This project is expected to have lasting societal benefits by developing analytical methods further empowering the study of the brain and the myriad of psychiatric, neurological, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative conditions. Proposed modeling efforts will fuel synergistic ongoing collaborative projects on biologically-inspired learning systems, further sustaining the growth of artificial intelligence and deep learning. This research also integrates with educational objectives through a series of didactic videos and a one-week workshop.<br/><br/>The brain is a tremendously complex system operating at multiple spatiotemporal scales. No framework has proved versatile and powerful enough to integrate the heterogeneous sources of information required to understand this system across scales. This project proposes a novel model-driven approach to address these gaps. Specifically, it will implement a multiscale forward model linking cellular mechanisms with whole-brain dynamics, integrating spiking neural networks and neural masses using co-simulation (Aim 1). It innovates by conceptualizing and implementing a framework informing macroscopic analyses (e.g., EEG) from microscale mechanisms constrained by mesoscale organizational principles. Further, it will leverage deep Bayesian learning for model parameter inference from simulated EEG, demonstrating that physiologically relevant latent variables can be studied from experimental data using multiscale, integrative modeling (Aim 2). The power of this model-driven approach will be illustrated using EEG recorded in genetically defined groups to investigate whether the imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory ratio in autism is associated with a breakdown in long-range effective connectivity, a use case of crucial relevance for understanding neural mechanisms and their dysregulation in autism (Aim 3).

The research aims to understand the effects of inhomogeneity on the systems? behavior. Focus is given to membranes in random environments and the study of their fluctuations. Such membranes arise naturally when classical models, such as the Ising or XY models, are either assigned random inhomogeneous interactions or are placed in a random magnetic field. They have also recently been discussed in the study of random quantum circuits. The research aims to explore the emergent physical phenomena from a mathematically rigorous standpoint.

Another instance of this phenomenon is first-passage percolation, where the metric structure of the space is altered by random local perturbations. This project will study fundamental problems in these areas with rigorous mathematical tools. The problems are centered on minimal surfaces in random environments, which are models for both the interfaces between different spins in random-bond and random-field Ising models, for the spins of the random-field XY model, and for geodesics in first-passage percolation.

As is well known, the past two decades have witnessed an exponential increase in the use of social or other networks, which consist of objects and connections between them, and carry a lot of information. These networks can be used to detect different groups of objects, each with similar characteristics or preferences. In materials science, advanced engineering alloys, such as steels and high-entropy alloys, may be thought of as 3-dimensional graphs with atoms residing at the nodes of a graph and its edges as bonds. These materials are often polycrystalline, and sudden, unexpected failures occur frequently in the form of fractures along crystal boundaries. Such failures are extremely costly, resulting in, for example, oil and gas spills and even bridge collapses. All the above problems can be cast as balanced graph cut problems, which are very challenging. In the literature, many existing approaches resort to approximate solutions. However, these solutions may differ significantly from the optimal ones. This proposal mainly focuses on the development of efficient and reliable methods for finding optimal graph cuts, which could significantly promote their applications to practical problems in the fields of materials science and social sciences.  <br/><br/>Partitioning a large data set into a prescribed number of subsets is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and it assumes wide applications in fields such as social networks, computer science, chemical engineering, and materials science. To conduct the partition, different balanced graph cuts have been proposed, including the Cheeger cut, the ratio cut, and the normalized cut. As one of the most important balanced graph cuts, the Cheeger cut is a challenging NP-hard problem. Existing approaches only provide approximate solutions. Recently, a novel nonlinear spectral graph theory was developed, and finding the Cheeger cut amounts to solving a constrained optimization problem with a non-smooth objective function over a non-convex set that consists of many different-dimensional simplex cells. The number of these cells is an exponential function of the number of vertices of a graph. Therefore, this raises another tough optimization problem. The proposed research in this project consists of three parts: 1) developing novel efficient and reliable numerical algorithms to solve the above-mentioned problem by using optimization techniques; 2) extending the existing nonlinear spectral graph theory to weighted graphs to enrich the theory and significantly expand its applications to real problems; 3) applying the proposed methods to tackle practical problems in metallurgical engineering and materials science. The projects discussed in this proposal also offer training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interaction drives space weather, which can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communication systems. While scientists have long studied how the solar wind influences the magnetosphere, key gaps remain in understanding exactly which solar wind conditions matter most and how uncertainties in measurements may skew predictions. This project seeks to resolve the limitations on: (1) how the Earth's magnetic boundary alters the effect of the solar wind, and (2) how uncertainties and hidden correlations in solar wind data affect our understanding of its effects on the Earth's magnetic environment. By combining spacecraft observations, advanced simulations, and machine learning, this work will provide a clearer picture of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling?improving forecasts of geomagnetic storms. The project will benefit society by measurably improving our understanding of how solar wind drives space weather, which is critical for protecting satellites, aviation, and power systems. The team will develop educational resources on handling uncertainties in big data to support STEM workforce development in the United States. By addressing fundamental questions in space physics and developing tools for scientific education, this project aligns with NSF's mission to advance national prosperity and defense through scientific progress.<br/><br/>The study will answer two key science questions: ?How do local (magnetosheath) parameters influence geomagnetic response compared to global (solar wind) measurements?? and ?Which specific solar wind and magnetosheath parameters best explain geomagnetic activity, and to what extent??. By correlating multi-point satellite observations in the magnetosheath and Lagrange point-1 with geomagnetic indices, this work will quantify uncertainties and biases in solar wind data and improve the reliability of coupling functions used in space weather forecasting. An MHD model representing the coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere system will be used to compare simulated and observed magnetospheric responses, where the discrepancies will help quantify missing kinetic effects in global models. The results of the project will (1) advance space weather prediction by refining coupling functions; (2) resolve data limitations by systematically quantifying uncertainties in solar wind measurements; (3) guide improvements in global models by constraining missing physics; (4) support training of researchers in handling uncertainties and related statistical biases while using big data.

Among these materials, electrostrictors have attracted growing interest in recent years. These materials are unique because they convert electrical energy into mechanical movement, but not the other way around. The project aims to understand the origin of the electrostriction effect in specific ceramic materials, where a few percent of foreign atoms with the same valency replacing the host atoms may be solely responsible for the field-induced volume change?and the resulting large strain. This insight opens a pathway to the rational design of lead-free alternatives to the dominant commercial electrostrictive ceramics. One of the main difficulties is the lack of methods for identifying the key features?called descriptors?of this effect and help predict which ceramic materials will exhibit this behavior. The project aims at developing a new idea for electrostrictive materials, using zirconium-doped cerium oxide. To explore how it works, X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used, a technique that uses very bright X-rays to track changes in the atomic environment around metal ions when conditions such as temperature, pressure, or electric field change. This work contributes to the field by improving understanding of this class of materials and helping predict new ones beyond cerium-based systems. Technologically, this new group of safe, electromechanically active materials could have wide applications. Students will also benefit through deeper learning in advanced topics in materials science, engineering, chemistry, and physics.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The focus of this research project is the development of atomic-level understanding of new types of ceramic materials, those that combine large electrostrictive strain with low dielectric permittivity and high elastic modulus, thereby potentially making these materials attractive for many important applications. The electrostriction effect is the change in mechanical dimensions of a solid as a result of the application by an electric field but not vice versa. The PI and the international collaborator, Prof. Igor Lubomirsky (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel), propose a new class of ceramic materials based on the Zr-doped ceria that do not have pre-existing elastic dipoles, yet are capable of generating strains up to 1000 ppm under applied field (as large as in the best commercial, lead-based, electrostrictors). To formulate the conditions for the rational search and design of other materials capable of exhibiting this electrostriction effect, the complex relationship between the descriptors of local structure and the dynamics of nearest neighbors surrounding the dopant (Zr) and the host (Ce) ion must be understood. Atomic-level synchrotron characterization performed under temperature, applied stress, or electric field conditions, provides insights into the effects of the separate responses of different components of this system and identifies the bond length mismatch and bond anharmonicity as likely candidates for electrostriction descriptors. This project offers research opportunities and training at advanced national research facilities at the post-graduate, graduate, and undergraduate levels. The project impacts the field of ceramic materials through the development of fundamental understanding and material selection rules for the new class of electrostrictive materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tritium is widely used as a radioactive tracer element in biological and chemical research and molecules labeled with this rare isotope of hydrogen are useful during the development of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other kinds of important substances. The findings of the funded research are anticipated to permit the incorporation of tritium (/deuterium) into small molecules with a high level of precision, such that the quantity and location of the hydrogen isotope of choice can be finely controlled. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Dr.  Clark and his research team members engage in a variety of educational and outreach activities. Foremost among these efforts is a holistic undergraduate career development and training program that combines undergraduate summer research experiences with a collaborative pharmaceutical industry and academic workshop jointly facilitated by the University of Puerto Rico Cayey and Marquette University. The program is designed to provide students with critical training to prepare them for successful careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and it places an emphasis on attracting participation from individuals belonging to groups traditionally underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Tritium is an ideal tracer nuclide because of its sufficiently long half-life (12.3 years) and the ability to prepare tritiated compounds with high specific activity for a variety of applications in chemical and biological research. For example, tritium-labeled small molecules are often used in radioligand binding assays and also for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of drug candidates. Despite the many important roles for tritium-containing molecules, there are a limited number of effective synthetic methods for the selective incorporation of precise quantities of tritium into organic compounds. Furthermore, spectroscopic techniques to characterize and quantify tritiated small molecules, especially enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of isotopic substitution, are either underdeveloped or do not currently exist. To address the first challenge, a suite of copper-catalyzed transfer tritiation and hydrotritiation reactions are being investigated that permit the regio- and stereo-controlled incorporation of tritium-atom labels into various types of alkene and alkyne substrates (including: allenes, 1,3-dienes, and enynes). The development of enantioselective variants of these transformations is also being pursued to allow for access to enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of tritium substitution and/or by virtue of deuterium and tritium substitution. To support reaction development, and in regard to the second challenge  identified above, molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy is being established as a general analytical technique to quantify enantiomeric excess of enantioisotopomeric materials and to determine their absolute configurations. It is anticipated that the findings from this research will expand access to selectively tritiated small molecules as useful tools for understanding how metabolites and/or pharmaceutical agents are processed in biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans have studied them for millennia. Number theory aims to understand patterns possessed by whole numbers. Fundamental questions revolve around multiplication: how often are numbers in some sequence even (i.e. divisible by two)? Divisible by three? Or five? Nineteenth century researchers introduced symmetry actions to reveal hidden patterns in numbers. And, in the 1970's, Robert Langlands made far-reaching conjectures on symmetry. These conjectures have occupied number theorists ever since. They predict patterns seen by symmetry actions will arise equally from the calculus of complex numbers (""modular forms""). A pattern appearing in two places is an example of a mathematical reciprocity. This project will refine Langlands' reciprocity prediction. The new tool is geometric spaces of symmetry actions, constructed by Emerton and Gee over the past fifteen years. These spaces are believed to convert reciprocity questions into geometrical ones. This project establishes instances of this belief. It will connect divisibility patterns from the world of modular forms to geometrical theorems on Emerton and Gee's spaces. The project has substantial broader impacts. Computational data will be included in the widely-used L-functions and Modular Forms Database. The project also develops computational tools for teaching. Open education resources (OERs) are learning materials placed in the public domain. Their primary benefit is providing learning experiences at low costs. They can be adapted to fit a diversity of learning environments. The project develops OERs for computer-based learning of number theory and abstract algebra. The project supports education and outreach in two more ways. First, Math Circles will be run in public schools. Second, research projects will be developed to support the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. Finally, the project plans two research workshops in number theory. Both aim to disseminate new advances in number theory and reciprocity. <br/><br/>The more detailed aim is a new study of p-adic slopes of modular forms and Galois representations. The p-adic slope of a modular form is how often its p-th Hecke eigenvalue is divisible by a fixed prime p. Predictions and theorems on slopes have been around since the 1980's. Seven years ago, Bergdall and Pollack proposed a way (""the ghost conjecture"") to unify almost all prior ideas. The ghost conjecture's input is a congruence class of modular forms. The output is an elementary recipe for slopes in the class. The main caveat is the ghost conjecture only applies to ""regular"" classes. But, assuming regularity, Liu, Truong, Xiao, and Zhao (LTXZ) recently established the conjecture. The current project removes the regular assumption in the ghost conjecture. The new tool is Emerton and Gee's (EG) moduli stack of Galois representations. In Galois terms, regularity is a generic property on the EG stack. The project's technical innovation is thus deforming slope questions over the stack. A geometrical reformulation will open the door to generalizing the LTXZ proof. It will also create space for novel studies of Hilbert modular forms or higher rank automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to sense in real time the ocean is highly beneficial for oceanography and environmental monitoring as well as for national defense/port surveillance and industry, such as aquaculture and oil & gas. This project will help answer the fundamental question of whether there is a correlation between plumes and the presence of gas/oil hydrocarbons. This project will perform sampling/mapping of ocean bottom plumes such as oil spills and chemical release from minerals, which is useful for exploration and extraction of ocean resources or for the monitoring of seabed mineral exploitation activities. This project will provide a better understanding of temporally and spatially limited ocean features, and could well be adapted for sensing other small-scale and dynamic phenomena, such as biological distributions in the water column. Last but not least, this project will develop a pipeline of computer-literate individuals who can solve research-related scientific problems trying to generalize to CPS as a science.<br/><br/>This project includes three interconnected high-risk/high-reward innovative research tasks centered on science and engineering: (1) Developing multi-fidelity numerical models of multiphase plumes to understand their current state and enable real-time forecasting. (2) Designing the physical underwater sensor network, which will consist of heterogeneous AUVs acting as mobile sensor nodes, equipped with heterogeneous plume sensors and acoustic array communications and positioning systems, and a surface gateway acting both as an underwater and above-water communication relay as well as as a centralized node for AUV positioning and operator command and control of the network; and devising novel adaptive control schemes that allow the AUVs to autonomously explore the extent of the plume. (3) Proposing novel ML-based methods for collaboration between AUVs and the Land-based computational cluster to balance network resources while taking into account communication failures, constraints on data storage on each node, their processing resources, the limited acoustic communication bandwidth and high latency, and the sensing and control capabilities of each node. This project will verify and quantify the capabilities of this CPS using a combination of hardware-in-the-loop emulations, field tests, and experimentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conditions of metamorphism depend on the pressure, temperature, and the kinds of fluids present in magmas and the crust. These processes can also change rock chemistry by driving the release of elements including carbon which may be liberated from the rock by decarbonation. The process of decarbonation is important in Earth?s long-term natural geochemical cycles. Decarbonation also produces residual rocks called skarns. Skarn deposits are often enriched in base (W, Cu, Pb, Zn) and precious (Ag, Au) metals; thus, a deep understanding of these processes promotes our understanding of economically valuable mineral deposits with broad societal value. Through their work on the project, students will be prepared for vital roles in the geoscience workforce. In particular, they will gain skills in quantitative research methods and numerical modeling to assess the tempo and mode of metamorphic processes that transport energy, fluids, and metals as magmas intrude and crystallize in Earth's crust. Given the close association with critical minerals, the work and student training opportunities constitute a front-line effort to sustain our understanding of resources that are important for the development and advancement of modern technology and the national security of the United States. On-the-ground public outreach efforts include engaging community members in primary and secondary school settings in Florida?s Leon County School District and the development of an exhibit of ore-minerals from the historic Mineral King District in Sequoia National Park. This exhibit will be housed in the Three Rivers Historical Society Museum, near the entrance to the National Park, where thousands of public visitors may potentially see it each year.<br/><br/>This work focuses on high-pressure and high-temperature decarbonation of marble and calc-silicate rocks that have been exposed by erosion into the deep lower crust of the Sierra Nevada mountains, California. To understand the influence that metamorphic pressure, temperature, and fluid availability have on decarbonation and mineralization, the investigators combine tools from field work, laboratory study of mineral textures and chemistry, and numerical modeling. Field studies, both ongoing and planned, will focus on key skarn occurrences. Textural analyses by both polarizing and electron microscopes will help identify characteristic features in skarn minerals that formed during metamorphism. Geochemical measurements, including X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (XRF), Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA), and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), will provide compositional insights at different scales?from whole-rock chemistry (XRF) down to micron-level details. Numerical modeling will further explore element and volatile migration in these lower crustal metamorphic settings, including carbon mobility and the geochemical processes controlling endowment of metals into ore deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite intensive efforts to assign more of the electromagnetic spectrum for mobile broadband, it is now widely believed that the traditional exclusive spectrum assignment approach is too limiting to meet the high demands of next-generation (NextG) wireless networks. SS remains critical at all frequency bands, including sub-6 GHz, millimeter-wave bands, and bands in between (7.125 to 24.25 GHz). To usher a new era of SS of licensed and unlicensed bands between (bilateral) and among (multilateral) wireless operators, new sharing models are needed. At their core, these models should incorporate proper incentivization mechanisms, as profit is ultimately the primary factor that motivates operators to share their spectrum. This project focuses on novel privacy-preserving game theoretic models for SS that are particularly suited for exploitation of the short-term spatiotemporal variations in traffic demands between operators.<br/><br/>The research agenda is organized into three thrusts. Thrust A: Non-collaborative SS Between Operators. In this thrust, inter-operator SS is investigated in a non-collaborative setting, where operators view each other competitively and do not wish to reveal private information. Several game-theoretic models, including a repeated double-sided Bayesian spectrum auction game with transferable seller and buyer, an incentivized oligopoly game, and a repeated single-sided spectrum auction game with unknown and private valuation will be analyzed. Thrust B: Collaborative SS between Operators. Collaboration between operators can potentially bring mutual benefits, but it may also harm their interests if not carefully managed. Understanding these complex interactions requires new game theoretic models for both licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The project will explore coalitional game theory to model these interactions. For inter-operator SS on unlicensed bands, the concept of value-of-right will be utilized to characterize the benefit obtained by each operator. Thrust C: Collaborative SS between Heterogeneous Wireless Systems. Cellular operators can lease part of their underutilized licensed bands to other non-cellular systems. To analyze the economic implications of these interactions, the project will study a hierarchical game framework consisting of a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. <br/><br/>The project will have broad technical, societal, industry, and educational impacts. If successful, the project will provide a much-needed understanding of which SS models are economically justifiable and under what conditions. It will drive operators to experiment with SS models deemed appropriate for their systems. The outcomes of the project will be shared with industry through various venues, including industry forums, NSF-funded wireless research centers, and others. The project also involves a comprehensive educational plan to broaden its impact, including research integration into curricula and training of students.<br/><br/>A website for the project will be created at wireless.ece.arizona.edu, and will be maintained throughout the course of the project. Measurements, datasets, and produced software will be provided to the public on that website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mechanical metamaterials are elastic materials engineered at the microstructure level to exhibit unique properties not found in nature. They have the potential to unlock new levels of performance in application domains like soft robotics, deployable structures, athletic gear, and prosthetics. However, designing microstructure geometries to create desired material properties poses significant challenges, especially for applications where the structures can undergo substantial deformations and self contact. In these settings, computationally intensive nonlinear simulation models must be used, and designing materials with controlled properties over their full range of possible deformations is prohibitively expensive with existing algorithms. The core aim of this research is to develop computational techniques to dramatically accelerate the simulation and design process for elastic metamaterials, making it practical to solve this challenging and important design problem. The project will also develop techniques for ensuring that the optimized metamaterials are as durable as possible and can be reliably manufactured on consumer-level 3D printers. The project will furthermore enhance STEM education by integrating these cutting-edge research topics into classroom lectures and facilitating outreach events where high school, undergraduate, and graduate students gain hands-on experience with computational design, numerical modeling and fabrication.<br/><br/>The project will build a new computational framework for (1) fast periodic homogenization of nonlinear elasticity and (2) optimal design of elastic metamaterials to exhibit target properties over large deformations (finite regions of strain space). The central technical contribution is a suite of novel data-driven acceleration techniques based on adaptive high-dimensional interpolation, smart sampling, and machine learning that will enable solving metamaterial characterization problems to controlled accuracy at practical computational expense. This fast characterization method will be wrapped within an inverse design algorithm that is formulated as a shape optimization over a rich design space of smooth parametric lattice geometries. The design algorithm will incorporate physics-based manufacturability constraints and stress minimization objectives to ensure that optimized parts are robust to forces experienced during fabrication and use. The design tool will be evaluated on the task of creating metamaterials to emulate existing material models as well as producing exotic material behaviors like multistability and jamming. The performance of generated metamaterials will be confirmed with physical experiments, and the proposed acceleration schemes will be assessed on large-scale benchmark datasets that will be created as part of the project. Finally, a basic multiscale design tool for creating compliant mechanisms composed of spatially graded lattices will be developed using the generated metamaterials. The research will deliver powerful and accessible open-source computational design software, fast solvers for nonconvex optimization and sparse linear systems, and benchmark datasets to foster evaluation of future metamaterial design work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, researchers have started to combine causal inference with modern natural language processing (NLP) models in order to analyze text data, which can be a rich source of information about human behavior, thought, and interactions. However, methods in this area have largely been focused on estimating average causal effects. The goal of many real world applications, is estimating heterogenous causal effects by exploring relationships between specific variables so that the knowledge can be customized for sub-groups. For example, knowledge to help clinicians decide which medications to prescribe to specific patients, central bank committees' decisions on interest rates in relation to changes in key variables, and platform administrators deciding how to optimally manage users. Estimating the effect of interventions from data can help inform decision making, particularly when effect estimates vary based on individuals? features. A rich, unstructured source of features is written text: notes from electronic health records (EHRs) detail patients? personal and medical histories, newspaper articles document national and international events, and online platforms host exchanges of users? written opinions. Yet, there exist few methods that can incorporate important aspects of unstructured text data into causal estimates. This project will develop and evaluate methods to estimate how causal effects vary based on features that are computationally measured from text data. The more fine-grained causal estimates from these methods could help data scientists and the public better target interventions for those with estimated positive effects.<br/><br/>This project will build, expand, and evaluate heterogeneous causal effect estimation methods that incorporate natural language processing (NLP) models and text data. The investigator will use data-driven methods to discover text-based proxies for causal variables and employ a proxy adjustment strategy to combine NLP classifiers with conditional average treatment effect (CATE) models. Then the investigator will create datasets for realistic empirical evaluation of heterogeneous causal estimation methods by building from the investigator?s prior work that down-samples randomized controlled trials. Finally, the investigator will develop methods for settings in which text is a proxy for multiple causal variables, i.e. the treatment variable, the pre-treatment features, and the outcome variable.

To better understand microbiomes, the scientific community has heavily invested in sequencing and multi-omics technologies, generating vast amounts of microbiome-derived data that offer valuable insights into microbial diversity and function. Despite these advances, studying soil microbiomes remains particularly challenging because soils host the most diverse microbial communities on Earth, leading to sparse and fragmented coverage. This coverage challenge is further exacerbated by small sample sizes and an inconsistent approach to collecting the different data types, making it difficult to develop comprehensive models that generalize across environments. This project aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence foundation model for soil microbiomes that leverages all existing public data sets in order to provide a more comprehensive framework representing soil microbiomes. <br/><br/>This project aims to address the challenges of soil metagenomic data sparsity by developing the Multi-Modality Microbiome Foundation Model (M3FM), an artificial intelligence model that integrates microbiome data across various studies and of several data types. M3FM will use a self-supervised learning approach to leverage the large number of public data sets from diverse sources without requiring extensive manual annotations. To test and refine this model, we will apply it to two key case studies: (1) linking soil microbial profiles to soil organic carbon content across a large-scale global dataset, and (2) mapping microbial shifts in response to climate change in a controlled, long-term field experiment. These case studies will deepen our understanding of how soil microbes influence carbon storage and nutrient cycling, as well as how they respond to environmental changes, such as climate shifts.

In the traditional approach, environmental scientists collect field data and perform experiments at, for example, a particular river basin, and then repeat this process at a different time and/or location to see whether their conclusions generalize. This approach is rigorous, but limited because it is time-, labor-, and cost-intensive; thus there exists relatively sparse ground-collected data across the planet. Another challenge is that intensifying human activities amplify the rates of change in conditions per location and time, so knowledge discovered in the past will likely fail to predict outcomes in the future. The challenge of predicting and ameliorating the effects of environmental change disproportionately affects under-resourced communities, including those most vulnerable to environmental changes that lead to food insecurity and hence greater socioeconomic instability. Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches cannot resolve this challenge because they require extensive human input, for example due to the need for labeling ground-collected data or other data layers, such as high-resolution satellite imagery. In this project, on-the-ground human observations and labels are replaced with AI-based discovery from abundantly available, mostly unlabeled visual data, such as that collected from a combination of satellites and other devices. This research proposes a paradigm shift that enables low-cost scaling across many types of images in order to lower the barrier to access of this scientific process. In the process, a novel AI framework is introduced that combines multiple data sources to automatically discover interpretable scientific hypotheses about the cause of ecosystem changes. Together, these approaches will accelerate the ability to identify solutions for the increasing environmental issues faced across our planet.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and validate an  AI framework that can use a broad array of image data collected using different sensing modalities (e.g., low-resolution satellite, drone, and internet-posted images) to automate and accelerate the generation of interpretable environmental scientific hypotheses at a planetary scale. An example might be correlating the spatiotemporal prevalence of certain invasive or disease-causing species with presumed causal factors present in the environment. The proposed framework integrates new techniques into foundational models for satellite imagery that can choose intelligently among sparsely-labeled data from different sensor modalities, optimizing between cost and accuracy trade-offs. By coupling this model with self-improving large language models that can both receive and provide interpretable feedback and hypotheses to researchers, this approach goes beyond black-box feature learning, the current state-of-the-art in computer vision. This proposed model will be applied and validated on the task of detecting submerged aquatic vegetation. This task poses a number of technical challenges (e.g., waves, turbidity, weak spectral signal through water) that are more difficult than detecting objects on land surface. Success in this pilot project will demonstrate that this type of model can be easily applied to the terrestrial environment and to tackle even greater grand challenges in environmental science.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the development of such data-informed solutions is still largely hampered by limited access to multisource, multi-resolution remote sensing imagery, leaving many in the machine learning and computational sciences communities unable to contribute robustly.  This project uses large language models (LLMs) to extract properties and relationships from relevant LA fire data sources, storing them in a comprehensive knowledge database.  By integrating complementary wildfire-related information, the framework facilitates monitoring of key physical parameters, such as real-time evacuation orders, meteorological variables, and air quality indicators.  <br/><br/>The project aims to develop an LA Fire Knowledge Graph-Agent (LAFireKG-Agent) platform--an autonomous and end-to-end LLM-based framework designed to meet the diverse data needs of end users, and enhance situational awareness for both safety and timeliness in wildfire risk management. The LAFireKG-Agent framework focuses on three key objectives: rapid decision-making, predictive modeling, and complex reasoning. Beyond these core capabilities, end-users, including computational scientists, environmental scientists, and risk managers, will be able to explore wildfire-specific questions, generate tailored insights, and receive data-driven recommendations. By integrating advanced machine learning and knowledge graph methodologies, this project will not only lead to more effective disaster preparedness and response strategies, but also promote open science and reproducible research in AI-driven environmental studies. The resulting tools and best practices will be shared through publicly accessible platforms, expanding research synergy among scientists, practitioners, and community organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) dramatically speed up such computation, making it possible to explore efficiently a broader range of plausible theories. This project develops AI/ML-based computational tools enabling novel searches for the physical origin and properties of the invisible elements making up the cosmos. These tools leverage complementarity between astronomical observations and laboratory-based experiments in determining the physics governing the growth of the Universe.

Because of this complexity, building accurate and timely models to predict and manage outbreaks in near real time is challenging and time consuming. It also requires copious data, which are often unavailable when it is urgently needed. To address these challenges, this project develops PanAX, a new computational system to improve how we prepare for and respond to evolving epidemics. The core idea is to use existing data and models in smarter ways and based on situational awareness, so we do not have to start from scratch every time. The focus is on identifying and leveraging the key underlying patterns and relationships that drive the spread of diseases, allowing models and data to be adapted to new situations more easily. Bringing together experts from computational and data sciences with epidemiologists,  PanAX explores the deeper causes of how epidemics spread in different contexts, helping to create models that are more adaptable, accurate and reliable based on real-time conditions. The project develops methods to reuse parts of existing data and models, applying them to new outbreaks in different locations or circumstances. Consequently, new tools will be created to better plan, inform, prepare the public, and respond to outbreaks. The project also trains students and researchers in advanced techniques in data and model driven response to epidemics, equipping them to tackle real-world challenges. In short, the aim of this project is to make epidemic response faster, more efficient, and more effective, using advanced data and machine learning technologies to benefit the society.<br/><br/><br/>Epidemics represent complex systems where the dynamics of disease spreading emerge from an interplay of time-dependent factors, including spatially distributed populations, mobility networks, and intervention policies. Modeling these systems accurately is challenging due to their multi-layered, causally interdependent structure and the lack of sufficient, high-quality data during critical early stages of an outbreak. The project develops an innovative framework, PanAX, that addresses these challenges by leveraging a data-driven, causally-informed approach to improve model reuse, generalization, and transferability across epidemic contexts. PanAX aims to disentangle and isolate domain-specific and domain-agnostic components from data and models, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and adaptive modeling. PanAX incorporates multi-layer, multi-scale causal relationships to better capture uncertainties in models derived from observational data and uses causality-based de-biasing techniques to eliminate statistical artifacts, enhancing model robustness and accuracy. It identifies transferable features and models between contexts, facilitating knowledge transfer from data-rich scenarios to emerging outbreaks with limited data. The framework focuses on scalable and effective spatio-temporal modeling, leveraging causal discovery and data management techniques to support counterfactual ""what-if"" analyses for outbreak preparedness and enhance prediction and intervention modeling by repurposing existing data and models. The project will deliver an open-source software system supporting researchers, public health officials, and policymakers in planning and managing epidemics. It aims to accelerate research, catalyze the development of innovative tools, and train the next generation of computer scientists to tackle cross-disciplinary challenges in causal learning, data integration, and computational epidemiology. By advancing the state of the art in causally-informed domain generalization and knowledge transfer, PanAX will transform how data and computer scientists contribute to epidemic science, offering scalable and generalizable solutions with real-world impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally designs of specific nanophotonic devices are obtained through empirical, trial-and-error methods with very limited, high level guidance by physics models and intuition. The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques open up new opportunities to more efficiently design new and more optimal nanophotonic systems. Yet there are many fundamental challenges at present, such as requirement of large training data sets, domain adaptation issues, and limited generalization capabilities. A promising new approach that may mitigate these limitations is to use generative models, particularly score-based diffusion models. This project aims to develop an innovative deep learning framework that combines physics-informed principles with scientific domain-adapted generative diffusion models to overcome key challenges in scientific inverse design and accelerate scientific discovery. The research will advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence and nanophotonics. Furthermore, the developed methods are potentially generalizable to other scientific disciplines.

However, these models often fail in surprising ways, particularly when confronted with complex reasoning challenges such as multi-step logical or mathematical inference or planning action sequences for tasks in physical environments. In contrast, humans approach reasoning in a fundamentally different way. Equipped with a mental model of the world, humans form a consistent understanding of their environment, enabling robust and deliberate reasoning. This world model allows us to simulate alternative actions, predict their outcomes, and refine our reasoning based on these simulations. This project aims to develop the next-generation machine reasoning capabilities by systematically incorporating the key concept of ?world model? into the design, training, and application of new reasoning models. The research will deliver a comprehensive set of innovative algorithms and models to elevate machine reasoning to a new level of flexibility, consistency, and robustness. Furthermore, the project will support the development of new undergraduate and graduate courses, provide mentorship to students in artificial intelligence research, and engage in extensive outreach efforts with K-12 students, the general public, and industry professionals.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the project will formulate and implement a new machine reasoning paradigm centered on world models. The research will deliver systematic innovations in three key areas: (1) new inference algorithms that induce the internal world model within pretrained large language models and conduct principled strategic planning that mirrors the deliberate reasoning in humans; (2) new learning methods with rich forms of experience beyond text, including embodied interactions for physical world knowledge and self-synthesized data for continual reasoning skill enhancement; (3) a new unified multi-modal world model for more comprehensive world understanding and efficient reasoning simulation in a unified latent representation space.

But we are unable to objectively gauge their true understanding of emotions, because we do not have rigorous definitions and tests that measure social and emotional understanding in AI. Without objective measures, we cannot assess progress in developing these models, identify blind spots or potential harms, or understand how to improve the emotional understanding of AI. This project addresses this knowledge gap, by defining what such social and emotional understanding entails, and devising new ways to measure the emotional capacity of AI language models. In parallel to the technical work, this project will also produce policy guidelines for designing and implementing AI that relies on understanding of human emotions, and educational materials to provide teenagers and adults with better AI literacy, and enable them to navigate the AI landscape with an awareness of its dangers.

When people communicate, they use words and body language?like hand movements and eye contact?to share what they mean. In the same way, robots that work closely with people need to understand both verbal words and nonverbal signals. One major challenge in creating such robots is that people?s behavior can change over time. For example, a person may use different gestures (e.g., pointing vs eye gaze) to describe an object at different times. The robot must notice these changes and adjust its responses. Also, if the surroundings change, robots must change how they act to keep being helpful. This project will help robots understand people better by studying both verbal messages and nonverbal cues. It will also improve how robots learn and plan to adjust when people?s behavior changes. The results of this research will impact people and help them to be more accepting of robots.

Falling can lead to reduced mobility, functional decline, and loss of independence. Detecting and mitigating fall risks are effective for avoiding the serious consequences of falls. Smart insoles have the potential to improve upon current clinical fall risk assessments by taking less time and by enabling automatic assessments during a daily routine. However, existing smart insole systems face two major hurdles.  First, the flexible pressure sensor arrays commonly used in them are prone to errors that slowly change over time, called ?sensor drift.? Sensor drift makes it hard to accurately measure critical fall risk assessment values, such as gait, balance, and leg strength. Second, the artificial intelligence models that are widely used to assess fall risk lack clinically meaningful explanations of the results, which are needed to identify fall risk factors, inform effective interventions, and build trust. This project will develop and evaluate a new auto-calibrated insole system along with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models.  The project will enable accurate, tailored, and reliable fall risk assessment during the normal daily routines of older adults. This research will result in fall risk assessment technologies that promote health, independence, and overall quality of life for older adults. This project also provides education and training for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as elderly care workers, on how to develop and apply wearable technologies and XAI for healthcare.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this project are divided into three thrusts. The first thrust is to develop a reconfigurable and multimodal insole system that can be auto-calibrated to accurately measure gait, balance, and lower-extremity strength over time. The auto-calibration will be achieved by a synergistic integration of flexible pressure sensor array data, inertial measurement unit data, and gait patterns. The second thrust is to create a context-aware XAI model to detect the risk of fall, identify fall risk factors, and inform personalized interventions. An interactive human-in-the-loop approach is proposed to enable the collection of comprehensive contextual information (for example, location, activities, and medication) with both the insole system and user engagement. Context-aware case-based reasoning is proposed to develop an expert-in-the-loop system that facilitates efficient interaction between medical professionals and the intelligent system, enables explainable fall risk assessment, and supports the development of personalized intervention plans. The final thrust is to establish a simulated free-living environment to comprehensively evaluate the long-term performance of the proposed system in personalized and trustworthy fall risk assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the healthcare domain, extensive enthusiasm has been witnessed on the exploration of LLMs in answering medical questions, extracting clinical information, and assisting clinical decisions. Studies have also revealed the limitations of LLMs regarding their lack of knowledge, fuzzy inference, and hallucination. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely studied due to their advantages in storing accurate, explicit and easily-modifiable knowledge. In the healthcare domain, various medical KGs have been used to support basic science research, pharmaceutical research, clinical decisions, and policy making. However, healthcare data are notoriously noisy and complex, where datasets about specific concepts and conditions come from various sources and include multiple data modalities. While pioneering studies have started to explore the combination of KGs and LLMs for healthcare, most of these studies have focused on applying existing methods and do not aim to fundamentally improve the KGs and LLMs towards solving various healthcare problems. In this project, the research team aims to comprehensively investigate and address the data, model and application challenges in healthcare, through Knowledge Graphs-Large Language Model Co-Learning (KG-LLM Co-learning), a systematic framework that will provide most (if not all) major functionality needed to build high-quality KGs that integrate complex healthcare data, enhance LLMs to obtain reliable healthcare models, and leverage multi-agent systems to account for data privacy, human values and broader factors in healthcare applications.<br/><br/>The proposed KG-LLM Co-learning framework includes several transformative technical innovations. First, the investigator's team will develop novel LLM-based methods for constructing comprehensive healthcare KGs, where they will study: (1) ontology-infused prompt designs for unifying existing healthcare KGs collectable from different sources, (2) structure-oriented retrieval augmented generation to continuously improve the healthcare KG based on evolving biomedical literature, and (3) alignment-based instruction tuning to further enrich the healthcare KG based on multi-modality patient data. Second, the investigator's team will design novel usage of KGs to obtain reliable healthcare LLMs, where they will focus on (1) enhancing the planning capability of LLMs through providing biomedical knowledge from KGs, (2) enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs through enabling biomedical neural symbolic rule learning over KGs, and (3) enhancing the grounding capability of LLMs through enforcing post-hoc biomedical error detection based on KGs. Third, the investigator's team will explore a new way of integrating data and models through the collaboration of LLMs in a flexible federated multi-agent system, which can rigorously facilitate (1) protection of data privacy, (2) alignment with human values, and (3) consideration of broader health factors. Finally, the investigator's team will conduct comprehensive evaluations regarding the important healthcare applications of risk prediction, treatment suggestion and disease subtyping based on de-identified patient data from publicly available databases, Emory Hospitals and the NIH Bridge2AI CHoRUS Consortium, through collaborations with healthcare professionals and clinical experts. If successful, the studies will fill critical gaps between AI advances and healthcare, informing methodology and technology designs in data management and AI/Machine Learning communities, while potentially generating new biomedical and disease knowledge for improving healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these capabilities are critical in a variety of fields, including biodiversity research, forensic investigations, and e-commerce, the task is challenging because differences between categories can be small, while variations within a category can be large. For example, two different bird species may look very similar, while male and female birds of the same species may look very different. Visual categorization in fine-grained domains is often treated as an image retrieval problem, where the label for a query image is determined based on the labels of the most visually similar images. An image retrieval approach typically performs better than standard classification approaches on fine-grained visual categorization tasks, especially in domains with very large numbers of classes. However, image-retrieval approaches often fail because a retrieved image that is visually similar is not necessarily from the same class, and potential images from the same class may not be retrieved due to low visual similarity. Moreover, the features learned by standard image retrieval models are often biased towards overall visual similarity rather than task-specific or domain-specific notions of importance. This limitation can hinder analysts and domain experts who may want to prioritize specific visual features due to their own expertise or intuitions. This project aims to improve image retrieval systems for fine-grained domains by aligning them more closely with how human experts perceive and prioritize differences, and enabling users to focus on the features most important to their task. While these innovations will be evaluated across a variety of fine-grained domains, they will studied through their integration into an existing real-world image retrieval system developed by the investigator that is used by analysts at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to recognize the hotels where victims of child sexual abuse and human trafficking are photographed.<br/><br/>This project will address the limitations of traditional image retrieval in fine-grained domains by developing systems that better align with human notions of visual similarity while empowering users to dynamically guide retrieval processes. Ensembles of specialized models, each focused on a single visual notion, offer improved alignment with human judgments but are computationally impractical for real-time use, particularly in resource-constrained settings. To address this, the project will explore the use of knowledge distillation to integrate the varied knowledge of the ensemble models into a single model, while preserving flexibility for users to prioritize specific visual notions learned by individual models in the ensemble at query time.  The project will also develop additional mechanisms for a user to dynamically refine search results. This line of work will have two directions: one where users specify their refinement by identifying visual features to prioritize, and one where the refinement is expressed in natural language. The project will also investigate the utility of subspace projection techniques as a pre-processing step for building task-specific indices from the embedding space of pre-trained vision language models. These innovations will enable both image-based and text-based retrieval systems where users can articulate preferences through natural language or visual cues, creating intuitive and scalable tools for specific fine-grained domains. Complementing these technical advancements, the project?s educational and outreach initiatives will focus on integrating machine learning competitions into undergraduate and graduate curricula to foster hands-on learning and critical thinking about real-world applications. Workshops will be organized to share best practices for using machine learning competitions as an educational tool, engaging educators, researchers, and students from a variety of backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to create advanced technologies capable of analyzing video streams in real time to anticipate potential anomalies with high accuracy. When such events are predicted, the system can initiate preventive measures, such as alerting users or triggering automated interventions?like activating a car's brakes or stopping an escalator. Importantly, the system will also provide detailed explanations, enabling users to understand why their actions or environment were adjusted. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques to identify patterns that precede abnormal events and generate visual or text-based explanations, this project has the potential to transform public safety and operational efficiency. For example, in intelligent traffic systems, it could help reduce pedestrian accidents and fatalities. In warehouses, it could prevent losses caused by equipment mishaps. In air traffic control, it could serve as a critical safeguard to ensure safe and orderly flight operations. By enhancing safety, reducing risk, and supporting human decision-making, this work addresses a critical need and aligns with national priorities to promote prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>While significant advancements have been made in video processing through artificial intelligence (AI), the task of anticipating video anomalies remains largely underexplored. Addressing this challenge involves overcoming three critical barriers: the absence of robust, annotated real-world datasets for anomaly anticipation, the lack of efficient real-time algorithms for accurate anomaly prediction, and the difficulty in explaining the reasoning behind AI-based decision-making in anomaly anticipation scenarios. This project will address each of these challenges. First, the research team will create a framework, based on the concept of digital twins, to semi-automatically capture and annotate anomaly anticipation datasets. This framework will focus on scenarios with static camera positions, enabling the dynamic extraction and recomposition of real-world objects and their motion patterns to create novel motion anomalies. Generative AI models conditioned on the designed anomalous patterns will be used to create realistic videos containing anomalies. Second, the team will design real-time AI models capable of accurately predicting motion-based anomalies prior to their occurrence by leveraging multimodal models trained to anticipate the trajectories and positions of objects as well as the probability of an upcoming anomaly. Third, the project will develop descriptive visual AI models that can provide stakeholders with clear, understandable explanations of anticipated anomalies. As a case study, the proposed methods will be applied to traffic anomaly anticipation, demonstrating the practical utility of the research. The project will also integrate research and education by incorporating in-class assignments and organizing annual student competitions. The success of this project will lead to a new paradigm for training explainable anomaly detection models and expand the conversation from anomaly detection to real-time anomaly anticipation and prevention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, construction work often suffers from low efficiency, where reworks due to defects, quality deviations or construction errors result in over almost $75 billion in wasted costs. Clearly, robotics and automation holds the key for the future of construction in order to deliver building projects in a way that is more accurate and efficient compared to conventional labor-intensive methods. This project proposes a framework for construction robots to scan and create schematic maps for highly dynamic and rapidly changing construction environments. Building accurate maps of construction sites is of great importance from both a robotics perspective and a construction management perspective. From a robotics perspective, semantic map building empowers robots with the capability to navigate and understand complex, dynamic workspaces. From a construction management perspective, having updated maps of the jobsite offers improved visibility in automating and scheduling construction projects and the capability to run construction work simulations and ?what-if? scenarios. <br/><br/>This project involves a confluence of research from robotics, machine learning, architecture, and civil and construction engineering. The overarching research goal is to achieve long-horizon map building, motion planning, and simulation in dynamic, unstructured construction sites through a merging of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology from the construction industry with 3D mapping technology in robotics. The research tasks involve developing incremental semantic map building algorithms for construction environments, using the generated BIM maps to assist robot motion planning on jobsites, and training time-dependent neural rendering models to recreate and replay construction events for robot simulation purposes.

Using the process of statistical inference, the models are tested against experimental data in order to constrain their underlying parameters, which leads to an improved understanding of the models and more accurate predictions for future data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most popular algorithm for statistical inference because of its power and simplicity. The goal of this project is to develop a new MCMC inference method, Shrek, which exploits the fact that many models in science and engineering can be calculated using different time-accuracy trade-offs. By performing inference with a combination of low accuracy but computationally cheap models, with high accuracy but computationally expensive models, Shrek can achieve better performance than traditional MCMC algorithms. The project team aims to apply Shrek to the field of cosmology to answer questions about dark matter, galaxy formation, and the expansion rate of the Universe. Furthermore, the team is developing an open-source software package so that scientists across many fields may use the Shrek algorithm.<br/><br/>This project exploits the multi-fidelity nature of many scientific and engineering models to help guide MCMC. Many simulations, including the Boltzmann codes ubiquitously used to model the cosmic microwave background, have tunable fidelities. This can be, for instance, a spatial or temporal resolution of the model, or an accuracy parameter for a differential equation solver. Using lower-fidelity models to guide the MCMC algorithm at the desired highest-fidelity model results in an MCMC method that converges to the true highest-fidelity posterior in fewer samples and less total computation time. The project team is developing a new recursive MCMC sampler (Shrek MCMC) that can exploit multiple fidelities for computational acceleration. Specifically, the plan is to (1) couple Shrek MCMC with neural network emulators, (2) prove convergence bounds and use these to guide automatic tuning of Shrek MCMC, and (3) develop a layered Multi-fidelity Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Shrek HMC) sampler. The resulting algorithms will be made publicly available through open-source licenses and will be incorporated into popular existing sampling packages. In cosmology, this research allows for larger, more flexible, inference pipelines. The team will use the new Shrek algorithms to test proposed solutions to the cosmological H0 and S8 tensions simultaneously and to model the local dark matter density in order to answer questions about the formation and content of the Local Group of galaxies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the U.S., 55.8 million older adults could value this type of help. Computer-based reminder tools can support similar tasks, but their use does not last. Robots can help more because of their social appearance, unique interactions, and tirelessness. Yet, the study of robots in real-world environments over long time periods is rare.

It is possible that the majority of these types of planetary systems formed with orbital periods in sync with each other, and that these resonant chains settled at the inner edges of planet-forming gas disks. After the gas disk dissipates, these resonances could gradually be disrupted due to the growth of eccentricity and inclination, leading to collisions.  This award combines cutting-edge observations, novel data analysis techniques, and rigorous numerical simulations to address the missing links in this emergent paradigm of planet formation. Broader impact in the state of Hawaii will be training programs for high-school through graduate students in scientific computing and other research tasks and education and public outreach to the local community. <br/><br/>Data from ground-based telescopes in Hawaii and elsewhere will acquire new transit times and radial velocities to complement the space-based discovery and atmospheric characterization data for resonant chains. N-body simulations will be used to model the photometry, assess stability, and track planet formation including giant impacts. The state of resonant libration or circulation and the role of second-order and non-adjacent resonances in disrupting chains will be assessed. Whether the prominent radius gap separating super-Earths and mini-Neptunes could be populated by giant impact collisions during the disruption of resonant chains will be determined. Atmospheric studies of resonant-chain planets will measure their atmospheric CO ratio and metallicity. It appears the terrestrial planets of the Solar System did not form a resonant chain initially; Jupiter and Saturn?s presence may have prevented that, so new radial velocity data will be acquired to test whether their analogs are present around resonant-chain systems.

Over the past five years, numerous publications have illustrated the pivotal role of these advanced memory arrays in supporting intelligent systems capable of real-time learning and swift adaptation to changing conditions. Nonetheless, the adoption of these technologies is hampered by the limited availability of mainstream fabrication processes. Currently, TSMC is the predominant provider, which imposes significant cost barriers for research groups eager to develop and test new circuit designs. This innovative digital twin (DT) is designed to validate new designs and propel research and development in this emerging field. It promises to revolutionize design processes across various technical specifications, including frequency bands, signal-to-noise ratios, and spectrum classifiers. The DT has a scalable architecture that facilitates the integration of extensive library models for memory devices and supports these devices across a broad spectrum of material systems and operational scenarios. The potential benefits of this DT, with sensor technology and computational model for advanced receivers, extends to enhancing national security by providing significant advancements in secure communications and threat detection by improving surveillance, data processing, and decision-making capabilities. This project also seeks to improve STEM education and foster a skilled workforce by deepening students' understanding of integrated sensor systems and digital twin technology. The project incorporates a broad educational effort that creates opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research.

The output of these systems is designed to look and feel like human communication. However, generative AI systems can lead users to trust the system too much, leading them to share inappropriate information for the circumstances. For example, conversational AI systems, or chatbots, talk like humans and may encourage users to trust them without enough objective information to support that trust. This affects decision-making and can lead to unsafe disclosures of personal information. The goal of this research is to find ways to reduce quick user judgments from affecting decisions and help design AI systems that are safer and more responsible. The investigators will design, build, and test strategies that counter quick intuitive judgments using theories of communication and Human-AI interaction. The results of this study will be shared in a toolbox to help others design AI chatbots more ethically and responsibly. The toolbox will also help teach people about AI and chatbots, which will equip them for the workforce of the future.<br/><br/>This CAREER project investigates strategies to ensure that user trust of Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots is warranted. Warranted trust involves assessments based on the actual capacities of the AI chatbot, rather than  reliance on unfounded heuristics (or cognitive rules of thumb). This will be achieved in two phases. In Phase 1, focus groups and experiments will be conducted to identify (objective 1) and empirically test (objective 2) the cognitive heuristics, and the cues that invoke them, that guide users? interactions with GenAI chatbots. In Phase 2, a series of experiments will be conducted to test strategies to mitigate unfounded heuristics via competing cues (objective 3) and interactivity strategies (objective 4). The project will advance knowledge in multiple domains, including secure and trustworthy computing and Human-AI interaction. It is innovative because it brings communication and media theory to Human-AI interaction and warranted trust, or trust calibration, research. Findings will be incorporated in a chatbot toolbox to help AI creators develop strategies to ensure ethical and responsible designs that accurately communicate AI attributes to users. The toolbox will also be distributed to non-STEM students, thus advancing AI literacy, and contributing to an informed workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, it will accelerate computationally demanding interpretation algorithms, specifically focusing on two widely used but computationally intensive explanation scenarios:  Use a solution approach for distributing gains or costs fairly . This acceleration will be achieved by novel randomized approximation techniques, substantially lowering computational complexity. Second, the project will construct unified explainer models using manifold-based modeling methods, allowing efficient generation of explanations through a single inference computation, thus enabling explanations for large volumes of data simultaneously. Third, the developed methods will be validated and embedded into critical medical applications (i.e., histopathology imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing in cancer prognosis) leveraging domain-specific knowledge prior and expert feedback.

How do they change over time in response to people?s online activities? And, most importantly, what effects do they have on people? Addressing these questions can help improve public policy and regulation for the advertising industry, and provide insights and guidance to Americans, whose online experiences are being shaped by targeted advertisements.

Many of them also struggle to make sense of and find meaning in their traumatic experience of loss due to the untimely death of a young child. Challenges with finding meaning have been associated with prolonged and complicated grief symptoms that can adversely affect grieving parents? quality of life. Although existing videoconferencing and social media tools can be used to provide bereavement support remotely, their user experiences are generally not engaging because of the fourth wall effect (an imaginary barrier that separates an audience from the fictional/virtual world), and they lack custom features to support meaning-centered grief therapies. Leveraging the unique affordances of multi-user immersive virtual reality (IVR) system and text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI), this project develops an immersive and individualized therapeutic experience that supports meaning-centered grief techniques and activities for bereaved parents in shared virtual worlds and fosters their social connectedness. Findings from project user studies will shed light on how different aspects of IVR system design will affect deep and sensitive emotion processing in bereaved parents when they are participating in mean-centered grief therapies in virtual environments (VEs). <br/><br/>Most existing IVR therapies for mental health are based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy and the content of these therapies is geared more toward behavioral change and modification or symptom management rather than the emotional processing of loss that is central to the grief therapies. To tailor to the special emotional and psychological needs in bereavement support, the project innovates with three design focuses to facilitate emotional connection and regulation in the bereaved individuals. First, the creation of an easy-to-setup robust avatar system with support of facial and body motion captures to show a user?s emotions during the grief therapies. Second, the integration of text-to-image generative AI models into the IVR to create a more individualized therapeutic experience for guided imagery mindfulness therapy by allowing the user to custom generate a skybox of surrounding environments in VE that are related to their grief experience and emotional status. Third, custom designed 3D user interfaces (3D UIs) that fully support meaning-centered grief techniques chosen to be conducted in IVR (e.g. group grief story sharing, guided imagery mindfulness, the wind phone, etc.). Ultimately, the project aims to answer the following research questions: (1) How does the immersive nature of an IVR experience affect a user's grieving experience in terms of connectedness, expression of emotions, and healing from loss? (2) Will the integration of a text-to-image generative AI model in IVR contribute to a positive therapeutic experience through customized visualization of a user?s emotions and mental status?

Materials discovery is often driven by complex and expensive simulation methods, typically accurate but time-intensive. The emerging machine and deep learning (MDL) models, trained on the massive simulated data collected over the past decades, offer a faster alternative. Unfortunately, these mdoels often fail to predict critical material properties, such as material stability, that the current project shall focus on. This project addresses these shortcomings of MDL models by integrating fundamental physical principles into the training of MDL models. By doing so, the models will better capture the intricate relationships between materials, leading to more reliable predictions. The project will benefit science and our society in a multitude of ways. Faster and more accurate materials discovery will accelerate innovation in clean energy, electronics, healthcare, national security, and more. The project also contributes to the advancement of artificial intelligence by introducing new techniques for constrained learning, which will impact fields beyond materials science. Additionally, the project emphasizes education and engagement by providing interdisciplinary training for graduate students, equipping them with skills at the intersection of computer science, materials science, and engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to boost the capability of deep learning  models to accelerate the discovery of solid-state inorganic materials, based on the massive publicly available simulated data from the gold-standard density functional theory computation based on quantum mechanics. The central hypothesis is that the current Deep learning models suffer in stability prediction because materials are presumed independent during training, against the physical fact that stability is intrinsically a property defined by material groups. To test this hypothesis and remedy this deficiency, this project will introduce a new approach to training models for materials discovery by incorporating explicit and implicit physics-informed constraints to encode the thermodynamic stability of materials with respect to phase transition and phase separation . The effect of these constraints will be assessed using existing benchmark problems and by generating additional data based on quantum mechanics to assess tailored problems in the spaces of random structure searching and fine-tuning universal machine learning interatomic potentials.

However, while these models have proven useful for generative tasks like programming and writing, it has been difficult to effectively use them as decision-making assistants for tasks like application review or grading. The key problem is verification: these models are opaque and prone to ""hallucination"" (i.e., making up content), logical mistakes, and other errors, making it hard to verify their advice. Existing research in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has sought to solve the problem by exposing the underlying model logic for human scrutiny but has struggled to demonstrate improvements in decision-making performance. This project will develop a new approach to the verification problem in LM-supported decision-making by focusing on settings where existing guidelines (such as grading rubrics, job listings, and medical guidelines) describe how decisions should be made. The team will develop methods for using LMs to apply existing written guidelines to decision-making tasks, and present explanations of recommended decisions that can be verified in terms of those guidelines. The idea is that this approach will lead to more useful explanations and better decisions than existing XAI approaches in practical domains, advancing the science of explainable AI while having beneficial impacts on many societal problems.<br/><br/>The project will first develop datasets and annotation tools for guideline-driven decision-making, collecting information on how humans draw links between guideline and input task documents, then compose those links into document-level decisions. The dataset will focus on three task types: short essay grading (with respect to a rubric); and resume screening (with respect to a job listing). The project team will then develop prompting and fine-tuning methods for LMs to identify, calibrate, and compose task-guideline links into verifiable decision recommendations. In parallel, the team will conduct experiments with people to study both human-human and human-model teaming in these tasks. Ultimately, this project will work toward safe, reliable, and well-aligned LM decision support by constraining the models to be ""connective tissue"" between humans and authoritative sources in the form of existing guidelines, rather than authoritative sources in themselves.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Human-Centered Computing and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the flow of traffic and the distribution of electricity both follow fundamental rules, such as conservation laws and flow dynamics. Despite these shared principles, research into these systems tends to remain siloed within specific disciplines, missing opportunities to leverage common insights. This project seeks to bridge  these gaps by creating graph-based computational tools that uncover shared patterns in diverse system behaviors, enabling scientists to reuse knowledge across fields and reduce redundant efforts. Beyond studying individual systems, the research explores the dynamics of interconnected systems, where interactions between networks can produce unexpected and complex outcomes. For instance, controlling a disease outbreak might fail unless social awareness and behavioral changes are also addressed. Similarly, adding a new road to ease traffic could unintentionally make congestion worse. Another example involves electric vehicles (EVs): their simultaneous charging near busy highways can overload local power grids. By examining these interactions holistically, the project aims to develop tools that predict and prevent cascading failures, optimize resources, and strengthen system resilience. A strong emphasis is also placed on interdisciplinary education and outreach to prepare the next generation of researchers to tackle challenges in managing interconnected systems, benefiting society at large.<br/><br/>This research develops a unified framework to analyze general graph dynamics and interconnected networks through three primary objectives. First, to develop a theoretical framework by deriving a generalized, interpretable framework for graph dynamics using advanced methods such as sparse symbolic dynamics to extract governing equations, probabilistic methods to model uncertainties in dynamic behaviors and uncover hidden patterns, and optimization techniques leveraging shared physical principles like conservation laws and flow dynamics. Second, to model interconnected systems by investigating how dynamics in one network, such as disease-spreading networks, affect others, like social awareness networks. To address the non-linear and often counterintuitive behaviors of interconnected systems, the project will create high-fidelity digital twin simulations that integrate domain-specific knowledge with probabilistic models. Established techniques like Lyapunov exponents will also be adapted for networked systems to enable early prediction and precise intervention. Third, to conduct community engagement and outreach by promoting awareness of the societal benefits of this research by introducing new interdisciplinary topics, connecting a variety of application domains, and ensuring the research outcomes have a broad and lasting impact across fields. Together, these efforts lay the groundwork for advancing our understanding and management of complex behaviors in interconnected systems, offering solutions to real-world challenges while fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, this project will create new learning materials, develop framework usage guidelines, and disseminate knowledge through K-12 engagement to foster STEM education among aspiring scientists and visual computing professionals.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the investigator will develop a computational framework for replicating, designing, and rapidly prototyping nano-structural coloration architectures. The research team will: (a) organize the diverse phenomena of wave-matter interactions through visual characterization, phenomenological understanding, and structural features into a robust operational taxonomy; (b) refine recent advancements in computer graphics rendering techniques with rigorous mathematical derivations; and (c) integrate real-world, large-volume data into the computational process. Developing an operational, data-driven taxonomy will enable the investigator to streamline modeling workflows for future digital twinning efforts in structural coloration. The investigator will derive Wigner distribution-based formulations to model light propagation through heterogeneous media. This approach will unify, compact, and modularize the computational framework. Subsequently, the team will integrate the operational taxonomy parametrically into this unified framework. This integration will facilitate efficient and flexible general emulations of optical biomimicry. Finally, the team will develop efficient methods for adaptive data acquisition in conjunction with iterative and incremental model parameter estimation. The resulting computational framework will enable both forward modeling for emulating nanostructures and inverse modeling for determining the properties of structures based on their observed appearances. This work will significantly advance the field of optical biomimicry by facilitating data-intensive, physics-based modeling and simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As demand for computing power grows, next-generation data centers must be designed with smarter, more precise integration of technologies to improve processing speed, data handling, and power management. At the same time, data centers are becoming increasingly costly to operate, due to high energy consumption and the use of rare materials?both of which present global sustainability challenges. Emerging technologies, such as chiplets and 2.5D integration, offer new possibilities by closely combining memory, specialized accelerators, and general-purpose processors to achieve significantly higher performance. However, achieving energy-efficient and resource-conscious computing with these new technologies remains a complex challenge. It requires innovative approaches to integrating power delivery and signal integrity alongside computing functions, and combining different materials ? such as traditional silicon with advanced components like gallium nitride power electronics and cutting-edge memory technologies.<br/><br/>The ECOCHIPLETS project will revolutionize the design of next-generation data centers through novel chiplet and 2.5D integration practices.

These servers will leverage novel chiplet-based design from the ground up to provide new higher performance and energy efficiency approaches along with often ignored concerns such as thermal, power delivery, and signal integrity, critical for system longevity developed through this project. These results will lead to advances in heterogeneous systems ideal for agile virtual hardware design and heterogeneous integration allowing for collecting data center resources to build virtual or disaggregated resources allowing compute software to match workloads seamlessly to various technologies and heterogeneous chiplets in the same package. This project takes a full stack approach by modeling costs and integrating critical components previously ignored in design and simulation tools, such as power electronics and asynchronous circuits. The result is hardware agility and efficiency with adaptability to new compute algorithms while simultaneously promoting long equipment lifetimes and reducing costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased variability in sea ice conditions affects shipping routes, offshore platforms, and coastal regions, creating a need for advanced tools to predict its behavior and inform resilient design strategies. This research seeks to uncover how the microstructural features of sea ice, such as grain size, porosity, and void distribution, influence its ability to withstand forces, such as the pressure exerted by an icebreaker or the stability needed to support offshore platforms, under varying environmental and mechanical loads. By developing a multiscale framework that connects microscale processes to large-scale dynamics, this project will generate insights critical for Arctic navigation, infrastructure design, and climate adaptation. The outcomes of this work will address key challenges at the intersection of geophysical science and engineering. In addition, the knowledge generated has broader relevance to other fields, including rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering. Outreach and education efforts will focus on the theme of ""North in the South,"" engaging students and the public through programs such as virtual reality experiences, and workshops on Arctic science.

Flooding is a significant problem that requires data-driven interventions to mitigate its impact on urban areas. However, quantitative data on flood frequency, depth, and duration that are required for real-time response as well as the design of flood mitigation programs are not available in most municipalities across the United States. This flood sensor technology was developed to address this data gap and support the design of interventions for flood resilience, emergency planning, and response. The technology has the potential for large-scale societal impact, by providing hyper-local, real-time flood data to city agencies to optimize emergency response and infrastructure planning, ultimately mitigating the risks of property damage and loss of life. In addition, the technology is designed to make flood data accessible to residents, enhancing public awareness and preparedness related to floods. A pilot test of the system is currently underway in New York City, and the model could be scaled to flood-prone cities globally.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an urban flood monitoring system. This is a sensor-based technology with supporting network infrastructure and real-time data processing pipelines that ensure the timely delivery of actionable flood event data. The solution is designed specifically for measuring flood frequency, depth, and duration in complex urban environments and includes: low-cost flood sensors that measure street-level flood depth at high resolution without requiring existing power or network infrastructure; cellular network integration, for transmission of data from sensors to servers in real time; artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data pipelines to process raw telemetry into actionable insights for stakeholders; and a suite of data services, including real-time flood data dashboards with time-series and map-based visualizations. A current pilot project consisting of over 250 flood sensors deployed in New York City has demonstrated an interest in the use of the technology by city agencies and residents. Results show that city agencies, including those responsible for emergency services, flood mitigation, transportation, and housing, require flood data for public safety and infrastructure design and planning applications.

This important conjecture has many interdisciplinary applications, including the tasks of determining whether these two parties are entangled or not, measuring how much information an adversary could have obtained if these two parties engaged in a secure quantum communication protocol, as well as improving a fundamental equation that captures the unpredictability of quantum measurement outcomes. <br/><br/>With the recent developments of quantum technologies, these uncertainty relations, like the CQC conjecture, are becoming more relevant. This project (1) identifies a sufficient condition for which this conjecture's validity will be proven beyond known classes of states such as the pure or entangled states, (2) extends this conjecture to cover more than two quantum measurement bases, (3) identifies a sufficient condition for this extended version of the conjecture, (4) explores the structures of states that respect this conjecture, and (5) its new applications. Novel usage of existing results involving generalized entropic uncertainty relations, information exclusion relations with classical-quantum states as well as experimenting with random bipartite quantum states will help with the identified tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be done by changing the flow of information through the language model in ways that make it more responsive to human emotions, more skilled at remembering and using information provide by humans, and better able to make fair and equitable decisions when the desires of many people come into conflict. This is important because many harms caused by AI systems can be traced to over-reliance on training data and an inability to adapt to the situation and needs of specific individuals. The new models will be rigorously tested in simulations where humans and AIs work together to make decisions and accomplish tasks, and will be probed to determine the potential benefits and/or risks introduced by this biologically-inspired computing paradigm. Additionally, this research will expand participation in science and technology by involving undergraduate students including a visiting research program that remotely hosts students from other universities. Research results will be shared via workshops, academic articles, and public media.<br/><br/>This research will be conducted via three research thrusts, each addressing a specific biologically-inspired property that current language models lack, resulting in new open-source foundation models in the 7B-20B parameter range. Specifically, the research team will develop biologically inspired algorithms that emulate mirror neurons, long-term potentiation, and metaplasticity within transformer-based language models. The models created during this project will be evaluated in two ways: (a) via automated metrics that assess the emotional responsiveness and factual accuracy of the model, and (b) via direct human-large language model (LLM) interactions in multi-party scenarios where participants have conflicting priorities, and where the LLM has control over (low-risk) outcomes that affect humans. These studies are designed to preserve participant well-being while providing a valuable litmus test of language model behavior ?in the wild?. It is anticipated that developed language models will be better able to manage contested resources, and more effective at responding appropriately to nuanced human emotions and experiences. They may also be uniquely suited to agentic scenarios that require the model to iteratively formulate objectives, plan actions, write and execute code, and deliver reasonable results back to humans in real-world scenarios with domain-specific constraints. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technologies Program, the Robust Intelligence Program, and the Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial Intelligence's (AI) recent successes have further exacerbated this computing-driven surge in energy demand. As a result, there is a growing need to integrate various energy sources in the energy grid. However, volatility of some energy sources creates new challenges for the power grid operators, who must continuously balance electricity supply and demand. Achieving the energy efficient data centers would not only help stabilize the power grid but also ensure that AI?s rapid growth remains supported. This project aims to realize that vision by integrating AI data centers into emerging smart grid programs. To this end, the project will develop a data center control framework to regulate data center power consumption with power grid and carbon constraints, all while providing necessary performance guarantees to data center users. By doing so, the project will help stabilize the grid and provide electricity cost incentives for data centers.  <br/><br/>This project aims to improve fundamental knowledge in AI data center management and optimization. While there is a rich body of research in large-scale computing system management and recent advancements in computing demand response, the state-of-the-practice is substantially lagging due to science and engineering challenges. To enable AI data centers to perform ?flexible computing"", this project will innovate in the following three directions: (1) designing AI data center planning and runtime optimization policies that provide performance or quality-of-service guarantees to user jobs while following dynamic power signals, (2) building an optimization framework where multiple data centers interact with grid operators and with each other so as to improve a global social cost metric, and (3) addressing key challenges in cyber-infrastructure implementation so that the designed server and data-center level policies are impactful in real-world scenarios. The project will provide validation of ideas through experiments on servers and simulations, and via deployment of prototype implementations on real-world clusters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mid Career Advancement (PFI-MCA) project enhances disaster response and recovery by improving the capabilities of machine learning and autonomous systems for rapid damage assessment. Frequent, and increasingly severe, natural disasters?such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods?threaten human health, infrastructure, and natural systems. All natural disasters leave a path of devastation necessitating effective management to mitigate their adverse effects on human life. Any delay in the decision-making process intensifies human suffering and wastes valuable resources. To make well-informed decisions promptly, robust and scalable hazard projection and damage assessment are needed. Using the wealth of available data, including powerful machine learning and autonomous systems, and traditional numerical hazard and vulnerability models, this project aims to build a smart technology with the potential to address the complex problems of rapid response and recovery. The methodologies and findings from this project will have broader applications in fields such as remote sensing, healthcare, and autonomous systems. The project will also contribute to workforce development by designing new curricula, conducting hands-on workshops, and offering lecture series and conference tutorials to engage all Americans.<br/><br/>The project aims to build a generalizable model for natural disasters based on large data from autonomous systems and numerical models. The model will address the complex problems of sustainable solutions for hazard projection and real-time damage assessment. While data-driven models are efficient, they often lack scalability as models trained on historical data and models trained on one hazard may not perform well in another. Conversely, numerical models, while widely used, are computationally intensive, which makes them less applicable to risk analysis. To overcome these limitations, this project will develop physics-informed machine learning models capable of operating across different geographic scales and disaster types by integrating physical principles with data-driven approaches. By combining insights from multiple disciplines, the project will create a unified model that captures the complex interactions among various disaster factors. Additionally, the project will focus on improving hazard modeling and its integration with post-disaster assessments to enhance decision-making. The novelty of the research lies in the development of advanced, physics-informed machine learning models aimed at improving vulnerability models and enhancing scalability and adaptability for real-time decision-making in post-disaster scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past engineering projects have, collectively, enabled the prosperous economies of deltaic regions that are enjoyed today, but have also created conditions that limit the regions in the future. In many places, including along the United States Gulf Coast, planners and governments are implementing new projects that aim to restore coastal changes, enhance economic and environmental support, and mitigate risk to human lives and livelihoods. However, there is not a robust understanding of how past delta management has influenced human decisions and outcomes. This project uses novel numerical and computational modeling approaches to study how human engineering decisions cascade through space and time over centuries of landscape change to create system conditions that limit or enhance the portfolio of management decisions available at future times. This work develops tools with coastal planners to determine the portfolio of projects that maximize coastal survival.<br/><br/>Delta engineering projects induce geomorphic change across space and time scales that impacts human lives and society. This project integrates cascading human decision making into landscape evolution models with three modeling approaches that inform one another and have complementary strengths: agent-based modeling, dynamical system modeling, and participatory modeling. Project research focuses on two testable hypotheses towards the tools and quantitative understanding of cascading decision making that are needed for delta planning: (1) local-scale engineering interventions can lead to less geomorphologically stable delta landscapes, when compared to a few larger system-scale interventions, and (2) human decisions can push the coupled system across tipping points, to both system benefit and detriment. Finally, research and development across all modeling approaches in this project is guided by community engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is focused on advancing understanding of atmosphere-ocean coupling on mesoscales (100-1000 km) over the Southern Ocean and its impact on the long-term, large-scale climate variability of the region. This addresses a significant gap in the current understanding of mesoscale atmosphere-ocean coupling regarding its role in decadal to multi-decadal climate variability. The Southern Ocean has some of the most continuous and significant mesoscale ocean variability on the planet, motivating the choice to focus on this region. The investigators hypothesize that mesoscale air?sea interaction related sea surface temperature anomalies lead to large-scale reorganization of the mid-latitude jet stream over the Southern Ocean, which in turn feeds back onto the large-scale currents and mesoscale ocean variability in the region. To explore this idea, the investigators will use a hierarchy of coupled climate models of different resolutions and complexities, allowing them to isolate and explore regional-scale processes, as well as examine these processes in conjunction with larger-scale influences. The project?s focus on advancing understanding of climate variability on decadal time scales has strong societal implications. The project also includes the mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students and an early career scientist, as well as an outreach effort with local high school science educators, addressing NSF?s priority to educate the next generation of scientists and the public on important science issues.<br/><br/>The team will take a hierarchical modeling approach, using both the Community Climate System Model v4 (CCSM4), and the intermediate complexity, moist quasi-geostrophic coupled model (MQ-GCM). CCSM4 coupled simulations to be examined by this study include a low-resolution and high-resolution ocean component and an interactive atmospheric ensemble approach established by the team in earlier work. This unique approach to coupled modeling allows the atmospheric noise to be filtered out of the model simulations, which for this study represents the atmospheric feedback from the mesoscale oceanic eddies. Thus, comparing the control simulations with the filtered simulations will help test the team?s hypothesis that feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere on mesoscales affects longer term conditions in both the atmosphere and ocean in the Southern Ocean region. Additional fully coupled and reduced coupled simulations will also be carried out under a doubling of atmospheric CO2 to understand the sensitivity of the multi-scale coupling processes to different background states. By exploring the importance of mesoscale interactions on the climate system, the project addresses a current gap in understanding and creates avenues for model improvement of decadal to multi-decadal climate variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbolic execution engines are tools that allow automatically finding bugs via mathematical reasoning. Unfortunately, symbolic execution of certain programs can be slow to the point where it is entirely ineffective. This project develops techniques to improve efficiency, thus allowing symbolic execution to be applied to a wider range of software. The project's novelties are in identifying problematic code patterns which slow down symbolic execution and developing new techniques which improve efficiency of symbolic execution of this code. The project's impacts are that symbolic execution will become applicable to a greater range of programs in domains where correctness is critical- such as finance and medicine- reducing the risk of costly software failures. In addition to developing the proposed techniques, the investigator plans to develop and teach a Software Verification & Formal Methods course, incorporating research developed under this grant into the course material where appropriate. Further, both graduate and undergraduate students will work on this project, introducing them to research and formal methods techniques. <br/><br/>Symbolic execution engines work by treating some program inputs as symbolic variables and ""running"" the program with these unknown values. When the program branches based on a symbolic variable, the symbolic executor splits into multiple states, and tracks the requirements for each state to execute. This project improves symbolic execution's efficiency by developing techniques to condense the number of program states that symbolic execution is required to reason about and reduce the amount of work required to reason about each individual state. The project is developing theory to allow showing correctness of the proposed techniques, in the sense that the optimizations do not risk symbolic execution missing any program failures. The optimizations are being practically implemented in an existing symbolic execution engine, G2, allowing an empirical evaluation of their effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge is to create algorithms that can analyze these datasets efficiently while also providing guarantees on the quality of the analysis. This project focuses on iterative algorithms that start with an initial guess and then refine it until they reach a solution of the desired quality. Prior work has made it possible to design efficient iterative algorithms with excellent performance guarantees, under the assumption that all of the data is processed synchronously, without any losses or errors. However, large datasets often need to be distributed across multiple servers, leading to asynchronous updates, partial losses, and errors. The main contribution of this project is a novel framework for the design and analysis of iterative algorithms that process very large datasets in a distributed fashion. This framework naturally captures many of the phenomena that arise in distributed data processing, and can be used to design strategies that are more efficient than requiring the servers to maintain perfect synchronization. Furthermore, this research will train undergraduate and graduate students to be experts on distributed processing of massive datasets. It will also lead to the creation of educational materials, such as tutorial articles, focused on the statistical analysis of massive datasets.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, this project builds on the approximate message passing framework, which is an established methodology for precise probabilistic characterizations of iterative inference algorithms, such as matrix estimation and linear regression, in the high-dimensional setting. The project will expand the approximate message passing framework to scenarios with distributed, dynamic, and stochastic data processing. This framework will be used to create iterative algorithms that can handle partial updates, distributed computation, and dynamic data, as well as to maximize the efficiency of these algorithms, in terms of the number of iterations or the overall compute budget. The project will also explore a new proof technique based on Gaussian coupling in order to provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the performance of approximate message passing with long-term memory, non-separable denoising functions, and very high iteration counts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlocking communication with implantable devices could revolutionize treatment for neurodegeneration, sepsis, solid tumors, and other morbidities, but it is hindered by a lack of clinically relevant communication protocols. These protocols either rely on power-hungry systems (e.g. Bluetooth) which demand large batteries and short lifetimes that inhibit implantation, or large antennas for wireless power and data transfer that are too bulky for patient acceptance. This project aims to develop and optimize a communication platform for multiple wearable and implantable devices to network with each other throughout all tissue layers in the body.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to optimize an emitter and receiver network between electromechanical wearable sensors and implantable actuators via computational and experimental approaches, including in vivo experiments in rodent models with potential applications in sciatic nerve stimulation and controlled drug delivery.

To learn about the sources of dust to the polar ice sheets, the project team will use a technique called isotopic fingerprinting. They will apply this approach to dust samples isolated from ice cores, which are cylinders drilled through a glacier or ice sheet, and which represent an important archive of Earth?s climate system. They will also measure the grain size distribution and concentration of the dust particles. Together with the isotopic fingerprints, these analyses will allow them to infer the source and transport pathway of the dust at different times in the past to improve understanding of past atmospheric circulation. They will apply this approach to ice core samples from several sites in Greenland and Antarctica.<br/><br/>Determination of dust source, or provenance, through compositional analysis is a powerful approach for understanding Earth surface processes and changes in the Earth?s climate system. Previous work has shown that paired measurements of dust particle concentration and grain size distribution represent an important complement to geochemical analyses, allowing simultaneous assessment of changing source inputs and transport intensity to remote ice core locations. Development of provenance and grain size datasets on ice core dust from Greenland and Antarctica will enable the project team to test a range of hypotheses about past atmospheric circulation. For instance, they will evaluate evidence for a potential West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse during the last interglacial period, known as marine isotope stage 5e, using ice samples from Taylor Glacier. They will test a new hypothesis that summertime warmth during the Younger Dryas interval led to widespread glacial recession in the Northern Hemisphere, activating high-latitude dust sources such as those in southern Alaska. They will compare samples from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Younger Dryas in the GISP2 ice core to assess whether the Greenland Summit was impacted by the emergence of these high-latitude dust sources. Finally, they will apply a novel method to combine potassium/argon (K/Ar) geochronology with strontium, neodymium, and lead (Sr-Nd-Pb) radiogenic isotope analysis, developed through a previous grant, to a suite of ice core samples from a range of sites in Greenland and Antarctica, including interglacial and LGM-age ice.

Examples include sediment transport in estuaries, biomedical flows such as blood flow in the heart and air flow in lungs, bio-inspired propulsion and flow past moving deformable objects.  Predicting the dynamics of these flows is especially challenging when the flow rates are high, but that is often the case of most interest.  This project will develop a new method, called Immersed Boundary-Modeled Large Eddy Simulations, to compute flow fields in turbulent flows past complex and deforming surfaces.  The method will combine numerical computation with models of turbulence near boundaries to produce accurate predictions of flow dynamics at much lower computational cost than comparable methods.  The models will be formulated to handle arbitrary deformations of immersed objects.  The project will also support educational initiatives to inspire K-12 students to pursue STEM careers, which will help expand the future science and engineering workforce<br/><br/>This project will introduce a novel framework that incorporates Immersed Boundaries and turbulence closures consistently. This framework is formulated using volume-filtering and differs from regular Large Eddy Simulation filtering in the treatment of the solid-fluid interface, which is key to incorporating Immersed Boundaries and turbulence closures consistently. The proposed work includes a priori analyses, modeling, and a posteriori analysis of unclosed terms resulting from volume-filtering the solid-fluid interface. A novel closure of the Immersed Boundary-shear stress with a dynamic-slip model specially formulated for moving and deforming Immersed Boundaries will be developed and characterized. This framework will be demonstrated in a prototypal high Reynolds number Fluid Structure Interaction problem that involves significant topology change: the dispersion of large deformable particles in wall-bounded turbulence. Rich datasets from this project will be leveraged to integrate research and education via two initiatives aimed at improving students? academic attainment. First, undergraduate researchers will build a digital learning environment for fluid dynamics using Augmented and Virtual Reality. This platform will allow lay users to engage with simulation data from this project intuitively and will be used to inspire K-12 students to pursue STEM careers during an annual outreach event.

Past engineering projects have, collectively, enabled the prosperous economies of deltaic regions that are enjoyed today, but have also created conditions that limit the regions in the future. In many places, including along the United States Gulf Coast, planners and governments are implementing new projects that aim to restore coastal changes, enhance economic and environmental support, and mitigate risk to human lives and livelihoods. However, there is not a robust understanding of how past delta management has influenced human decisions and outcomes. This project uses novel numerical and computational modeling approaches to study how human engineering decisions cascade through space and time over centuries of landscape change to create system conditions that limit or enhance the portfolio of management decisions available at future times. This work develops tools with coastal planners to determine the portfolio of projects that maximize coastal survival.<br/><br/>Delta engineering projects induce geomorphic change across space and time scales that impacts human lives and society. This project integrates cascading human decision making into landscape evolution models with three modeling approaches that inform one another and have complementary strengths: agent-based modeling, dynamical system modeling, and participatory modeling. Project research focuses on two testable hypotheses towards the tools and quantitative understanding of cascading decision making that are needed for delta planning: (1) local-scale engineering interventions can lead to less geomorphologically stable delta landscapes, when compared to a few larger system-scale interventions, and (2) human decisions can push the coupled system across tipping points, to both system benefit and detriment. Finally, research and development across all modeling approaches in this project is guided by community engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More general spaces such as pyramids and polyhedra also arise as the positive parts of more complicated objects, and they turn out to have interesting boundary structures: vertices connected by edges, which are in turn contained in faces, etc. The boundaries of various totally positive spaces model diverse phenomena such as outcomes of a scattering experiment in particle physics or different ways to sort a list of numbers. In turn, these spaces are amenable to concrete study using techniques from combinatorics, which concerns discrete objects such as graphs and lists. The project will use the lens of total positivity to reveal the underlying combinatorial structure of spaces of polynomials and hyperplanes. It will also support K-12 outreach activities.<br/><br/>Lorentzian polynomials were recently introduced to resolve several outstanding log-concavity conjectures.

Since the formulation of the Shapiro-Shapiro conjecture in the 1990's it has been known that total positivity can be employed to construct Schubert intersection problems whose solutions over the complex numbers are all real. This project will broaden this phenomenon with applications to real algebraic geometry. A third direction is to study the totally positive parts of Springer fibers, certain subvarieties of flag varieties which play a significant role in representation theory and algebraic combinatorics.

Wearable robots have the potential to enhance mobility for a wide range of users, including individuals with neurological or musculoskeletal impairments, older adults, and able-bodied individuals. Unlike traditional walking aids, robotic exoskeletons can adapt their mechanical assistance to meet each user's unique needs and adjust over time to optimize gait efficiency. However, current personalization approaches focus primarily on adapting the robot without fully considering the human user's natural ability to learn and adapt. This research project attempts to address this critical gap by investigating novel ways to guide and leverage human neuromotor learning to further enhance the performance of gait-assistive exoskeletons. This award will also support training the next generation of researchers to develop robotic systems that enhance human locomotion through three key activities: (1) hosting a regional locomotion research symposium for students, (2) engaging students in hands-on human-robot physical interaction projects, and (3) raising public awareness of the potential of robotic technology to improve mobility.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this CAREER award is to develop gait-assistive robotic exoskeletons that not only adapt their mechanical assistance to the user but also actively ""coach"" the user to work with the device to walk more efficiently. By influencing both human adaptation and its own behavior, an exoskeleton can optimize cooperative learning between itself and the user, leading to faster and greater improvements in walking efficiency for diverse users. To achieve this goal, the PI's team will conduct a series of foundational experiments to attempt to: (1) develop new metrics to assess the user's proficiency in operating gait-assistive exoskeletons; (2) determine how the characteristics of exoskeleton assistance adaptation algorithms influence user learning; and (3) identify effective multimodal interaction methods?such as auditory and/or vibrotactile cues?to guide and accelerate (i.e., ""coach"") user learning. The results of these experiments intend to ultimately inform development of novel adaptive exoskeleton control algorithms that incorporate multimodal ""coaching"" signals to enhance human-robot cooperative learning and maximize gait efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transportation agencies across the United States grapple with outdated and fragmented data systems that hinder efficient asset management and strategic decision-making. These challenges result in increased operational costs, reduced infrastructure reliability, and potential risks to public safety. This digital platform addresses these significant challenges by offering a unified solution that integrates asset data across various lifecycle stages, including planning, construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation. A unified approach not only simplifies and streamlines the data management process but also facilitates greater visibility, accountability, and efficiency within state transportation agencies. By adopting this solution, state agencies can better align their practices with federal regulations, thereby reducing unnecessary costs and improving the overall effectiveness of infrastructure investments. The social and economic benefits include enhanced public safety, improved infrastructure reliability, and substantial cost savings through optimized asset management.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a comprehensive digital asset management platform that incorporates an integrated four-step framework ? define, organize, strategize, and execute ? to streamline data governance across the transportation asset lifecycle. The platform distinguishes itself from existing solutions by providing flexibility tailored specifically to the unique operational and technological requirements of state transportation departments. Technically, this platform advances current capabilities by employing targeted data collection strategies to avoid data overproduction, and to maintain high-quality, actionable insights. The approach integrates previously siloed systems, enabling consistent data standardization, and improved interoperability. By addressing these technical and operational barriers, the technology enhances strategic planning and operational efficiency. Users benefit directly from improved data accessibility and precision, enabling more informed, proactive decision-making and resource allocation, thus enhancing overall infrastructure management effectiveness and public safety outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the increasing complexity of physical models and a rise in demand for high-performance computing (HPC) resources, errors can occur at all levels of abstraction in the computing process, significantly impacting the process of computer driven-scientific discovery and decision-making. Thus, correctness in scientific computing remains a formidable challenge. Prior works have attempted to verify a numerical program end-to-end but fall short in terms of scalability in the proof process, and target an idealized implementation of a numerical program. This project addresses this gap by developing a scalable verification framework, which directly targets application SC libraries written in Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)-compatible programming languages, like C/C++, Fortran and Julia, instead of an idealized implementation. The project's novelties are mechanized functional models for SC algorithms, accuracy and stability proofs of critical numerical algorithms in reduced- and mixed-precision floating-point (FP) formats, and the development of evidence and assurance cases for guaranteed correctness of future ports to new accelerated hardware. The project's impacts are an increased productivity of model developers, by providing a framework for root cause analysis of numerical bugs, and strong assurance cases for highly performant SC applications. <br/><br/>This project addresses the fundamental challenges of creating a scalable end-to-end verification of SC code by addressing issues in each of the following abstraction layers: (1) numerical behavior at the compiler level by rigorously modeling compiler optimizations for FP arithmetic and extending the translation validation framework of the Crellvm tool (which performs Coq-verified translation validation for LLVM), to prove correctness of FP optimizations at the compiler intermediate representation level; (2) modeling approximations in mathematical formulations by mechanizing the FP error model for reduced- and mixed-precision analysis, and formalizing the correctness properties of chosen SC modules, like the convergence and stability of numerical algorithms, with respect to the mechanized error model; and (3) algorithmic approximations in various HPC libraries by verifying that the HPC libraries implement the mathematics correctly by connecting the mechanized proofs of mathematical correctness to the compiler FP optimization correctness proof. The investigators also propose to develop several automations to boost scalability and productivity of end-to-end verification of SC applications. These methods will be applied in the context of matrix-free finite element algorithms in problems related to inertial confinement fusion and plasma applications. To increase adoption of formal tools in the scientific computing communities, key ideas and theories in formal methods will be disseminated through workshops and seminar series, thereby bringing together two widely separate communities, formal methods and scientific computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They play fundamental roles in Arctic food webs by consuming phytoplankton and protozoa and serving as food for fish, marine mammals, and birds.  The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global rate, potentially putting many species at risk. The ability to predict the response of copepods to warming depends on robust knowledge of their upper thermal limits. This project will provide novel information on the critical thermal limit of key Arctic copepod species and whether or not this limit reflects their ability to succeed in their environment. The work will also provide insights into the success of a copepod species that is dramatically increasing its abundance in the southern Arctic, which may alter the transfer of energy in the ecosystem. The project?s findings, highlighting Arctic research, will reach broad audiences via social media and activities with  K-12 students. The project will also train one Ph.D. student.<br/><br/>Arctic species, which typically are cold temperature specialists,  may be at risk of extinction because of the fast change the Arctic is experiencing. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the physiological limits to survival in these species and whether or not these limits are a good measure of fitness. The project?s goals are: 1) Quantify critical thermal limits in three key copepod species of Disko Bay, Greenland, a widely studied Arctic ecosystem.  2) Evaluate the linkage between critical thermal limits and fitness proxies. The project will test the hypothesis that: a) Critical thermal limit is higher for the southernmost of the three species studied, which has dramatically increased its abundance in Disko Bay in the last 30 years. b) There is a positive correlation  of the critical thermal limit, measured at an ecologically relevant temperature, and fitness proxies such as the balance of ingestion and respiration rate, egg production rate, egg hatching success, body size, and oil sac size. The educational and outreach activities of the project are proportional to the modest funding request and aimed at enhancing the public understanding of how marine species respond to change. A second objective is to communicate research in Arctic regions.

Space plasma phenomena impact human infrastructure in space, such as satellites and manned space vehicles, and technological systems on Earth, such as power grids, global positioning systems (GPS), and long-distance radio communication. One of the challenges in understanding naturally occurring phenomena in outer space is the difficulty and the expense of performing scientific measurements in space. Another challenge is that nature rarely produces the exact same event multiple times to allow for distinguishing random measurement fluctuations from the phenomena of interest. Yet, the characteristics of the plasma in the space environment are key to understanding and predicting such space plasma phenomena. This project will study how energy is transferred from waves to particles in space-like plasmas contained in the PHASMA facility at West Virginia University. The broader impacts of the project include training of graduate students in a research environment that emphasizes the synergy between basic and applied plasma physics; recruiting and retaining undergraduates into physics through involvement in cutting-edge research activities; and support of an educational initiative that provides hands-on STEM activities to K-12 students.<br/><br/>The in-situ measurement of ion and electron velocity distribution functions in space has revolutionized the field of space physics by providing the space physics community the ability to study and understand kinetic-scale plasma processes; test theories and computational models; and to discover new plasma phenomena. The PHASMA facility has the capability to non-perturbatively measure the three-dimensional (3D) ion and electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs), magnetic fields, and turbulence in laboratory plasmas created at space-relevant conditions. This project addresses three open scientific questions in plasma physics and supports the development of a new diagnostic method, quantum beat spectroscopy (QBS), for measuring weak magnetic and electric fields in plasmas. The first study focuses on particle energization during magnetic reconnection by exploring the correlation between perturbations to the 3D electron velocity distribution function (EVDF) and spontaneously appearing electrostatic lower hybrid drift waves. The second study involves measurements of EVDF perturbations when the waves are externally driven rather than spontaneously excited by local instabilities, as in the edge of a helicon plasma source. A third study will explore the effects of flow shear on the rate of reconnection and the effects of changing the guide field strength on the direction of propagation of the reconnection site between two tilted merging flux ropes. All three of these studies will be compared to numerical and theoretical predictions. The QBS development effort will provide an exciting new method of non-perturbatively measuring weak magnetic and electric fields in low-pressure laboratory plasmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While it is well established that the two leaflets of most biological membranes differ in their lipid composition, recent evidence shows that this asymmetry extends to many other properties, such as elastic material parameters or mechanical stresses. Prof. Deserno will develop theoretical and computational techniques to elucidate how these new facets of asymmetry alter lipid mixing in each leaflet. He will focus on three-component model mixtures (saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol), whose thermodynamics is well characterized, at least in the symmetric case. Prof. Deserno will predict how such membranes react to controlled perturbations (e.g. changing cholesterol content), which will be tested in collaboration with experimental groups. By uncovering a new dimension of membrane organization, this award will advance fundamental understanding of vital physiological processes. At the same time, it affords academic training for graduate and undergraduate students and incorporates educational activities involving a local high school, as well as an ongoing physics teachers training program.<br/><br/>Prof. Deserno will develop the theoretical framework and computational tools necessary to integrate differential stress into predictions for the phase behavior and mechanical stability of asymmetric ternary lipid bilayers. He will examine how trans-leaflet cholesterol partitioning and mechanical stress/torque balance constrain the choice of proper thermodynamic variables for such membranes. Elastic and thermodynamic drivers for cholesterol distribution and leaflet-specific non-ideal lipid mixing will be captured in a continuum-level free energy model, further tested and refined using coarse-grained simulations. Perturbations that move leaflets between two-phase coexistence regions, and their read-out in terms of cross-leaflet phase imprinting and curvature creation, will be analyzed and compared against experiments. Since transient scrambling has been proposed as a means to create raft-like domains in asymmetric but leaflet-wise well-mixed membranes, Prof. Deserno will examine the viability of such a ?transient raft hypothesis? by determining what bounds the underlying dynamics of scrambling versus lipid diffusion. This project will also advance science education across multiple constituencies, ranging from graduate and undergraduate students conducting this research, to tailored outreach events given at a local high school, and ?Physics Teachers Workshops? that have been run at CMU since 2021.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest is the recent suggestion that techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence can be applied to problems in Coxeter combinatorics. (2) Current interest in total positivity comes from multiple directions--the recent resolution of conjectures on the topology of Lusztig?s totally nonnegative flag varieties, the development of a theory of algebraic groups over a semifield, and the discovery of deep relations with scattering amplitudes in particle physics. (3) Progress in the theory of representation theory of p-adic groups has been fueled by geometric perspectives in representation theory.

Each year over 2 million people are diagnosed with cancer in the US. Many people still have residual cancer after completing cancer treatment. The current standard of care is very poor at diagnosing residual cancer, often times the residual cancer is not detected until it is too late to cure. Additionally, 7% of cancer patients have debilitating fear of residual cancer. Diagnosing people with residual cancer earlier will save many lives by treating the residual cancer before it spreads and can no longer be treated to cure. This method has the potential to improve cancer diagnosis, improve cancer treatments, and improve patient outcomes by providing a better method for diagnosing cancer, which is highly sensitive and highly accurate. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve and validate the method is effective at diagnosing cancer from a blood draw with patient samples. A cancer test needs to be highly accurate because cancer treatment is often very toxic. A cancer test also needs to detect cancer very early because that is when cancer is most curable. Creating a cancer test, which can do both, is very difficult.  Cancer DNA in blood is very rare, as vast majority of the DNA in blood is from normal cells. This method turns a needle (cancer DNA) in a haystack (normal DNA) into a mountain of needles by blocking the normal DNA from replicating in a tube. This increases the percentage of cancer DNA, making it very easy to determine which samples have cancer DNA and which samples do not. This project will optimize the current method, verify the method can easily be done in a commercial setting, and validate the method works with real patient samples. The anticipated result is a simple blood draw that can accurately detect a single copy of cancer DNA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although ground and air settings have seen the increased use of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) systems, robot swarms, and distributed sensor networks, CPSs remain extremely rare in the underwater domain. To address this and promote the progress of science, this project aims to use an adaptive and intelligent network of heterogeneous AUVs for plume search, classification, and mapping in scientific understanding and forecasting. The ability to sense in real time the ocean is highly beneficial for oceanography and environmental monitoring as well as for national defense/port surveillance and industry, such as aquaculture and oil & gas. This project will help answer the fundamental question of whether there is a correlation between plumes and the presence of gas/oil hydrocarbons. This project will perform sampling/mapping of ocean bottom plumes such as oil spills and chemical release from minerals, which is useful for exploration and extraction of ocean resources or for the monitoring of seabed mineral exploitation activities. This project will provide a better understanding of temporally and spatially limited ocean features, and could well be adapted for sensing other small-scale and dynamic phenomena, such as biological distributions in the water column. Last but not least, this project will develop a pipeline of computer-literate individuals who can solve research-related scientific problems trying to generalize to CPS as a science.<br/><br/>This project includes three interconnected high-risk/high-reward innovative research tasks centered on science and engineering: (1) Developing multi-fidelity numerical models of multiphase plumes to understand their current state and enable real-time forecasting. (2) Designing the physical underwater sensor network, which will consist of heterogeneous AUVs acting as mobile sensor nodes, equipped with heterogeneous plume sensors and acoustic array communications and positioning systems, and a surface gateway acting both as an underwater and above-water communication relay as well as as a centralized node for AUV positioning and operator command and control of the network; and devising novel adaptive control schemes that allow the AUVs to autonomously explore the extent of the plume. (3) Proposing novel ML-based methods for collaboration between AUVs and the Land-based computational cluster to balance network resources while taking into account communication failures, constraints on data storage on each node, their processing resources, the limited acoustic communication bandwidth and high latency, and the sensing and control capabilities of each node. This project will verify and quantify the capabilities of this CPS using a combination of hardware-in-the-loop emulations, field tests, and experimentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This platform will improve patient outcomes by offering a safer alternative to current immunosuppressive standards and address the psychological and social impacts of autoimmune skin diseases. Also, the microneedle patch will empower patients by being both self-administered and discreet, offering a user-friendly solution that seamlessly integrates into daily life. Beginning with Alopecia Areata as its first indication and followed by conditions including vitiligo and psoriasis, this technology addresses a significant market niche, affecting up to 3-4% of the population.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance a hydrogel-based microneedle patch for managing autoimmune skin diseases to achieve scale-up readiness. Traditional treatments for autoimmune skin diseases, like creams and ointments, lack efficacy due to their limited skin penetration. Microneedle-mediated therapies overcome this by effectively delivering therapeutics through the stratum corneum. However, consistent drug exposure between patients is a critical factor for regulatory approval. Reducing the administration time (or wear time) of the patch to minutes rather than hours can prevent premature patch detachment and minimize patient-to-patient variability in drug exposure. The project goals are to modulate the current drug release profile of the microneedles patch and determine the minimum wear time required for therapeutic efficacy. The Phase I strategy will be two-fold: (1) chemical iteration of the hydrogel matrix of the microneedle patch and (2) determining in an in vivo model of Alopecia Areata the impact of faster release kinetics on the therapeutic efficacy.

Plasma can create very reactive particles that help transform tough chemicals, but it only affects a small part of the gas and most of the reactive particles disappear before reaching the catalyst. Current catalysts don?t work well in these conditions, so this project will design new ones that are better suited for plasma systems. Researchers will use advanced lab experiments and computer models to study how plasma and catalysts interact. This could lead to useful applications like clean energy, water treatment, and medical sterilization. The project will also support student research and inspire younger students to explore science and technology.<br/><br/>Despite years of continuous research on plasma-catalysis, there still exists a critical knowledge gap in understanding the complex dynamics of plasma-catalytic interfacial systems. In particular, there is a crucial need to seek new mechanisms to enhance and precisely control the synergistic interactions between catalytic surfaces and plasma intermediates. The goal of this project is, therefore, to explore a transformative approach to designing catalysts that are responsive to the electric field and are compatible with plasma systems. The significance of this research lies in enhancing the electric field close to the surface of the catalyst. Experiments and computational studies will be integrated to deeply investigate the influence of surface field and charge induced at the plasma-catalyst interface on the chemistry of plasma-generated intermediates. The underlying mechanisms governing the adsorption of active species under enhanced surface field and surface charge will also be elucidated to leverage the surface charge as a tool for engineering the reaction and enhancing the reaction selectivity at the molecular level. Ultimately, the fundamental understanding obtained will be used to develop a bi-functional catalyst for the highest possible rate of carbon dioxide and hydrogen conversion and selective production of oxygenates. The anticipated outcome of the project, rooted in fundamental understanding, includes establishing design guidelines for novel multifunctional catalysts with tunable properties for non-thermal plasmas, which can potentially promote a new research area in plasma-catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peritoneal metastasis is a common pattern of disease spread in advanced gynecological and gastrointestinal cancers. There are nearly 1.2 million patients globally, with around 75,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States. Specifically, colorectal peritoneal metastasis remains particularly challenging to treat, with a high recurrence rate of over 65%. Unfortunately, the overall survival and disease management has only modestly improved in the past 30 years. The U.S. peritoneal cancer market is projected to reach approximately USD 1.0 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 9.1% from 2024 to 2030. This underscores the urgent therapeutic and economic need for innovative strategies to treat colorectal peritoneal metastasis. One promising clinical advancement is intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can be integrated into standard laparotomy or laparoscopic procedures. Currently, there are over 100 active or recruiting clinical trials related to PDT. This nanoplatform enables efficient co-delivery of PDT and chemotherapy to selectively target cancer cells that could not be removed by surgery, potentially improving patient survival.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will help bridge the translational gap of a novel light-activatable nanoplatform, facilitating its successful commercialization for the treatment of peritoneal metastasis. The nanoplatform is designed for the targeted co-delivery of PDT and chemotherapy to eliminate tumors left after surgery. The nanoplatform combines antibody-photosensitizer conjugates and liposomal chemotherapy to enhance the safety and efficacy of PDT. Following injection, harmless red-light selectivity activates PDT within cancer cells, inducing cancer cell death while minimizing damage to healthy cells. This Phase I project will help de-risk the translation of the nanoplatform from bench to bedside by developing a scale able manufacturing process, determining the optimal drug administration route, and identifying PDT threshold. To achieve these goals, the key objectives are to: 1) Compare the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the nanoplatform following intravenous or intraperitoneal administration, and 2) Establish the photobleaching threshold of PDT. Insights from this study will accelerate clinical translation and ultimately provide surgeons with an alternative treatment for peritoneal metastasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plastic pipes are replacing traditional metal pipes in distribution systems due to the well-documented health and safety issues caused by leached toxic metals during aging. However, the safety of these replacement plastic pipes is unclear. One unintended consequence of using plastic pipes is their susceptibility to degradation, a process that has been shown to result in the formation of microplastics (MPs). Additionally, organic chemicals, frequently incorporated as additives into pipes to enhance their properties, can leach from plastic pipes during the degradation caused by free chlorine. Moreover, these organic chemicals can react with free chlorine once they have been leached to produce new chemicals that can be more toxic than the additives themselves. The potential health risks associated with MPs and chemical additives in drinking water have raised increasing concerns. Through this study, we intend to holistically evaluate the safety of plastic pipes in the presence of chlorinated drinking water. Students involved in this research will acquire skills in materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, and environmental engineering.

Despite their relatively consistent structure compared to other cloud structures, like thunderstorm complexes, there is significant small-scale spatial variability in stratocumulus clouds that impacts further cloud and precipitation development.  This project will use an emerging modeling technique and existing cloud observations to identify the sources of spatial variability at the cloud microphysics level.  The research team will then identify the best methods to simulate these sources of variability.  The broader societal impact of the project would be to improve modeling of clouds which affect Earth?s radiation balance.  There is also a substantial educational aspect to the project, enhancing the training of the next generation of atmospheric scientists.<br/><br/>The primary objectives of this project are to understand the microphysical sources of spatial variability in low-level stratocumulus clouds, how this spatial variability influences the temporal evolution of the mean cloud and precipitation processes, and how the design of microphysics parameterizations influences the ability to simulate the observed spatial structure of these cloud and precipitation fields.  The research team will run Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of drizzling stratocumulus clouds using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) based on observed cases with Lagrangian microphysics.  Lagrangian particle-based methods employ particles that are representative of a multiplicity of millions to billions of identical hydrometeors, which get around problems introduced in traditional bulk and bin microphysics schemes.  The project will focus on four primary potential sources of microphysical variability resulting in rain: condensation, stochastic collisions, turbulence-enhanced collision kernels, and giant aerosol particles.  The results of the simulations and comparison with observations will then be used to train the Bayesian Observationally-constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS), with the introduction of a stochastic component.  Simulations will be run in a purely non-stochastic mode and a fully stochastic mode to address the hypothesis that the non-stochastic BOSS will not be able to simulate the spatial variability whereas the stochastic BOSS will.  Further simulations will address the importance of the identified microphysical variability as well as whether BOSS can be run in a single-category mode with increased predictability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and is estimated to occur in up to 10% of all pregnancies. When left untreated, preeclampsia can result in serious and sometimes fatal complications including stroke, seizure, kidney disease, heart disease, and preterm birth. Diagnosis of preeclampsia remains a significant challenge. The current diagnostic standard for preeclampsia relies on insensitive tests and outdated standards, allowing diagnosis only after evidence of organ damage in the mother. Also, preeclampsia tests generally need to be performed in clinical labs by trained personnel, leading to increased costs, decreased accessibility, and decreased likelihood of catching preeclampsia before it becomes dangerous to mother and fetus. This technology addresses these challenges by providing a preeclampsia diagnostic that can be used at home by untrained personnel with just a finger-stick volume of blood that is no more difficult to interpret than an at-home COVID test. This technology may improve detection, treatment, and management of preeclampsia and improve the outcomes of pregnant individuals with this condition.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a preeclampsia diagnostic that can be used at home by untrained personnel with just a finger-stick volume of blood. The technology is based on a recently developed cell-free synthetic biology technique to measure proteins harnessed from nature and re-engineered to detect recently discovered biomarkers for preeclampsia in a mother?s blood sample. A visually interpretable color change that provides semi-quantitative screening for preeclampsia has been created that is similar to an at-home COVID test. The use of cell-free systems, which consist of purified bacterial extracts, enables easy reprogramming to create diagnostics for new diseases without the extensive, expensive, trial-and-error development cycle associated with existing point-of-care protein measurement techniques. This system is compatible with the lyophilization that is needed to enable shelf-stable products that can be distributed commercially. This technology may allow the development of at-home screening and diagnostic testing for preeclampsia and for many other different types of diseases in the future with the goal of improving patient outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conditions of metamorphism depend on the pressure, temperature, and the kinds of fluids present in magmas and the crust. These processes can also change rock chemistry by driving the release of elements including carbon which may be liberated from the rock by decarbonation. The process of decarbonation is important in Earth?s long-term natural geochemical cycles. Decarbonation also produces residual rocks called skarns. Skarn deposits are often enriched in base (W, Cu, Pb, Zn) and precious (Ag, Au) metals; thus, a deep understanding of these processes promotes our understanding of economically valuable mineral deposits with broad societal value. Through their work on the project, students will be prepared for vital roles in the geoscience workforce. In particular, they will gain skills in quantitative research methods and numerical modeling to  assess the tempo and mode of metamorphic processes that transport energy, fluids, and metals as magmas intrude and crystallize in Earth's crust. Given the close association with critical minerals, the work and student training opportunities constitute a front-line effort to sustain our understanding of resources that are important for the development and advancement of modern technology and the national security of the United States. On-the-ground public outreach efforts include engaging community members in primary and secondary school settings in Florida?s Leon County School District and the development of an exhibit of ore-minerals from the historic Mineral King District in Sequoia National Park. This exhibit will be housed in the Three Rivers Historical Society Museum, near the entrance to the National Park, where thousands of public visitors may potentially see it each year. <br/><br/>This work focuses on high-pressure and high-temperature decarbonation of marble and calc-silicate rocks that have been exposed by erosion into the deep lower crust of the Sierra Nevada mountains, California. To understand the influence that metamorphic pressure, temperature, and fluid availability have on decarbonation and mineralization, the investigators combine tools from field work, laboratory study of mineral textures and chemistry, and numerical modeling. Field studies, both ongoing and planned, will focus on key skarn occurrences. Textural analyses by both polarizing and electron microscopes will help identify characteristic features in skarn minerals that formed during metamorphism.  Geochemical measurements, including X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (XRF), Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA), and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), will provide compositional insights at different scales?from whole-rock chemistry (XRF) down to micron-level details. Numerical modeling will further explore element and volatile migration in these lower crustal metamorphic settings, including carbon mobility and the geochemical processes controlling endowment of metals into ore deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike existing technologies that require extreme cooling, these detectors offer greater accessibility and efficiency, with applications spanning satellite communication, secure online communication, national security, and healthcare. In satellite-based optical communication, they can enable faster, more secure, and reliable data transmission, while in cybersecurity, they can strengthen quantum encryption to protect against cyber threats. Their use in defense may enhance surveillance and threat detection, and in healthcare, they may improve medical imaging and diagnostics by increasing sensitivity and accuracy.

Coherent optical detection, where a weak sample beam is mixed with a strong reference beam before photoconversion, is currently the most sensitive technique, but is ultimately limited by quantum shot noise resulting from the reference beam. This project aims to demonstrate that fundamentally lower detector noise is possible while retaining coherent mixing and amplification benefits. Using a passive, range-mapping, coherence sensitive plasmonic optical amplifier to mix the weak sample and strong reference beams prior to photoconversion makes the limiting shot noise proportional to the amplified intensity of the weak sample beam instead of the strong reference beam. This fundamental change improves signal-to-noise, and therefore detection sensitivity. This proposal will demonstrate a broadly applicable approach to fundamentally improve optical detection signal-to-noise in coherent detection. It will expand the application envelope for not only ranging detectors, but for all applications where it is possible to access a reference beam.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent studies indicate that genes transferred between species can make it difficult for scientists to build an accurate evolutionary tree or understand the relationships between species. This project will use parrots, one of the most endangered and illegally trafficked groups of animals, to better understand how often species transfer genes and how that impacts scientists? ability to accurately build an evolutionary tree. The researchers will collect genetic data, including sequencing genomes, for all parrots. These data will be used to build an evolutionary tree of parrots and answer questions about gene transfer between parrot species. This data will also be used to aid conservation efforts by developing forensic DNA barcodes that will help law enforcement correctly identify illegal products made from endangered parrot species. The project will build collaborations between forensic scientists and natural history museums, provide training and mentoring for students through early-career researchers, and share findings with the public and scientific communities.<br/><br/>To estimate accurate phylogenetic trees in the genomic era, the effect of genomic architecture (the structure, organization, and content of a genome) on phylogenetic signal must be understood. Large-scale phylogenetic methods often do not account for gene flow, nor do they address the interaction between genomic architecture and phylogenetic signal, which can lead to well-supported but inaccurate evolutionary relationships. Using the global radiation of parrots as a focal system, this project will reconstruct a nearly complete time-calibrated phylogeny of the clade to assess gene flow across an entire radiation and predict genomic regions prone to biasing phylogenetic estimates. The researchers will generate new genomic resources, including five chromosome-level reference genomes and genomic-scale markers for over 400 previously unsampled taxa. The project aims to test the following hypotheses to make general predictions about the factors causing gene tree discordance and to inform a species-level taxonomic revision: 1) non-monophyletic species are a common feature across the parrot evolutionary tree; 2) non-monophyletic species and weakly supported relationships are associated with a higher prevalence of gene flow that spans millions of years; and 3) genomic architecture is relatively conserved across the parrot radiation and can be used to mitigate the effects of gene flow in phylogenetic inference across temporal scales. This work will offer a high-resolution view of the interaction between phylogenetic signal, gene flow, and genomic architecture in parrots, and demonstrate how this framework can be used for improved taxonomic classification and wildlife management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early work by pioneers of the field during the 1930s and 1940s revealed that von Neumann algebras are highly complex objects exhibiting remarkably rich structural properties. Over time, their study evolved into an independent and vibrant area of mathematics, spurring the development of powerful mathematical theories and uncovering deep connections with other fields such as group theory, dynamical systems, topology, and more recently, model theory. Beyond mathematics, von Neumann algebras have also provided valuable insights in physics (notably statistical mechanics), biology (DNA molecular structure), engineering (cell phone network design), and computer science (including error-correcting codes, quantum information theory, and quantum computing). These algebras naturally arise from simpler mathematical concepts like groups (symmetries) and their actions on spaces, which are extensively studied in geometric group theory and ergodic theory. The project investigates a number of open problems, with the central goal of developing new methods at the intersection of these disciplines to advance the classification of von Neumann algebras arising from such structures. Additionally, the project offers extensive opportunities for graduate student training and career development.<br/><br/>Building on the PI?s prior work, this project will investigate new research avenues in the classification of group and measure space von Neumann algebras, along with their broader applications. The PI will develop innovative techniques that lie at the crossroads of deformation/rigidity theory, group theory, ergodic theory, and continuous model theory to advance several fundamental open problems: (i) identifying new groups and algebraic group structures that are fully determined by the von Neumann and C*-algebraic frameworks, such as property (T) W*- and C*-superrigid groups, including those with infinite centers; (ii) calculating the endomorphism semigroup, the fundamental semigroup, and the Jones index set of property (T) group factors, as well as automorphism groups of reduced group C*-algebras; (iii) constructing new, naturally occurring examples of W*-superrigid actions?an area of mutual interest in orbit equivalence and von Neumann algebras; (iv) investigating tensor product decompositions for factors associated with negatively curved groups and existentially closed factors; and (v) developing new methodologies to distinguish ultrapowers of factors. This work is inherently interdisciplinary, promising significant synergies among geometric group theory, ergodic theory, C*-algebras, model theory, and von Neumann algebras. To foster the professional growth of the PI?s graduate students, the project will continue to support a visiting program that enables students to collaborate with peers at leading institutions, broadening their exposure to diverse research perspectives and expertise. In addition, the PI will continue to promote this field by teaching advanced graduate courses, organizing specialized seminars, and actively disseminating research outcomes through publications, invited talks, and presentations at national and international conferences and research seminars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach misses the opportunities presented by the ubiquitous and intrinsic geometric irregularities of living organisms. This project will attempt to address this critical gap by developing the required engineering models for identifying and applying distinctive irregular patterns to design structures to match the range of functions and energy- and material-efficiency of biological systems. Potential applications include energy harvesting, intelligent actuation and control in vehicles, smart shock absorption, vibration damping, and acoustic attenuation. Drawing inspiration from the musculoskeletal patterns in diving seabirds and stingrays, the new findings plan to yield transformative technological solutions to achieve efficient multifunctional structures. Additionally, the project will develop a user-friendly, open-source application to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and make these concepts accessible to scientists, engineers, and the public. This app will help translate insights from biological dynamics into practical applications in biomechanics, biomedical science, and engineering.<br/> <br/>This research aims to make a transformative shift in current multifunctional structure modeling framework and biodynamics interpretation. Irregular patterns for engineering structures can overcome current limitations in structural dynamics engineering ranging from complex actuation for robots and vehicles to energy extractions from ocean waves.

The focus will be on three engineered geometric irregularities --- local rigidity, interfaces, and pattern connectivity. These irregularities should enable control of the wave properties and emerging dynamics, key to achieving advanced engineered structures with dynamic functions. This effort intends to demonstrate (i) impact energy attenuation using a seabird neck-like structure without damping materials and (ii) self-propulsive locomotion without actuators using wave-stingray-like wing structures.

Tomography concerns the retrieval of information about a geometric object based on limited information arising from its cross-sections or shadows (projections). For example, think of trying to determine the volume of a mountain based on the size of its shadows at different times of the day. Isoperimetric problems arise in geometry and optimization and have been of interest for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Greece. In a modern context, isoperimetric problems can involve studying the regularity of high-dimensional information. In complex data sets, high dimensionality often results in a regularizing effect.  Tomographic and isoperimetric problems have been highly influential in many scientific disciplines, including physics, engineering, and computer science.

The first impact of these systems will be improved access and reduced healthcare disparities for low-income and rural patients by introducing the first high-performance, compact CT scanners for lung-cancer screening into convenient locations outside the hospital or into mobile vans. This SBIR will enable the development of the new x-ray technology that will enable these next generation CTs for the first time.

Current conventional CT systems use mechanical rotation of a single large x-ray source to image an object at multiple angles required to see inside an object?s 3D volume. These mechanical systems are large, bulky, and expensive to maintain. This SBIR will enable a new generation of compact, lightweight CT systems using a distributed x-ray source technology that replaces mechanical rotation with arrays of many individual x-ray sources placed around an object. Each x-ray source is electrically turned on and off in sequence to image an object at different angles required to create a 3D image. The main barriers to the creation of these systems are 1.) the lack of an x-ray source that is high-performance (speed and power), compact, and low-cost, and 2.) a methodology to array these x-ray sources into a system.

In engineering design, predictive computational simulations enable design engineers to analyze the expected performance and cost of designs without needing to go through the expensive process of building and experimenting on physical prototypes. In typical settings, engineers have access to both high-fidelity simulations, which issue the most accurate predictions but at high computational cost, and low-fidelity simulations, which issue lower accuracy predictions more cheaply. If only high-fidelity simulations are used, the high computational cost of each simulation can limit the number of designs that can be considered, leading to sub-optimal designs. On the other hand, if only low-fidelity simulations are used, the low accuracy of the predictions can lead to less reliable designs. This CAREER award will support research focused on enabling engineers to create more optimal and robust designs across all engineering disciplines, ranging from space missions to biomedical devices to renewable energy systems, thereby advancing national defense, welfare, and prosperity. This award will also support the development of new educational modules for training both undergraduate engineering students and practicing engineers in industry in modern computational design methods, thereby promoting the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The intellectual contributions intend to yield new machine learning methods that enable design engineers to rapidly explore high-dimensional design spaces and quantify design-relevant uncertainties, opening up a new class of design problems that can be solved with the new methods. The multifidelity scientific machine learning approach intends to train models on both limited high-fidelity data and more abundant low-fidelity data by combining these data in a multifidelity control variate framework. Multifidelity control variates, which exploit correlations between high- and low-fidelity data, have been successfully used for uncertainty quantification for engineering design to yield provably more accurate uncertainty estimates at lower cost. The research activities of this project are to (i) develop and analyze new multifidelity control variate frameworks for linear and nonlinear regression, and (ii) validate the multifidelity learned models on a range of computational design problems including reliability analysis, optimization, and sensitivity analysis. The educational activities will (i) develop a short course on the methods for industry engineers, (ii) create curricular modules on computational design that complement existing undergraduate design courses, and (iii) involve undergraduate students and industry collaborators in the evaluation and validation of the research methods.

Traditional medical imaging equipment, although powerful, tends to be bulky, expensive, and energy-intensive, limiting its accessibility and usability. This innovative research proposes to miniaturize a photoacoustic imaging (PAI) system?a promising technology combining ultrasound and light?to visualize deep tissue functions. By developing a novel signal encoding and decoding framework, the hundreds of detection channels needed in conventional PAI can be drastically reduced to just one. This advance makes it possible to create lightweight, affordable, and energy-efficient wearable imaging devices. Such devices will greatly benefit telemedicine, enhance early diagnosis and timely intervention of diseases, particularly in underserved and remote communities, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes. Additionally, the project incorporates educational activities designed to inspire undergraduate and high-school students to pursue careers in medical device innovation and STEM fields.<br/> <br/>The technical goal of this CAREER project is to develop a novel spatiotemporal signal encoding and decoding framework enabling the miniaturization of PAI. Conventional PAI requires arrays of hundreds to thousands of ultrasonic detectors for high-resolution imaging, resulting in large, expensive, and power-hungry equipment. To overcome these limitations, the project will implement a specialized encoding medium (hardware) to uniquely tag photoacoustic waves with distinct spatiotemporal signatures, enabling serial detection by a single-element detector. Along with this hardware innovation, a mathematical decoding algorithm (software) will be developed to reconstruct the original signals, effectively creating over one thousand virtual detection channels from a single physical detector. This integrated hardware-software approach will maintain imaging performance comparable to traditional multi-detector systems while dramatically reducing the device size, cost, and energy consumption by one to two orders of magnitude. Successful completion of this research will provide foundational knowledge for designing compact and efficient wearable PAI and ultrasound devices, promising wearable applications for clinical diagnostics and healthcare delivery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inspection robot market is rapidly expanding, driven by a growing need for efficient, accurate, and cost-effective inspection solutions in sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, oil and gas, infrastructure, and energy. These robots play a crucial role by detecting faults, corrosion, or structural issues that could lead to costly failures if left unchecked. However, traditional inspection robots often face limitations when inspecting hard-to-reach or confined spaces, such as narrow pipelines, small machinery components, or tight structural cavities. This challenge has accelerated the demand for miniaturized robots designed to operate in these restricted environments. Conventional approaches use tendon-driven mechanisms, which are limited by friction that reduces range of motion along tortuous paths. This technology is an electrically driven system that bypasses the limitations of friction in tortuous environments. The solution addresses these challenges at a smaller scale using miniaturization to reach previously inaccessible points to detect failure points earlier in the process. This miniaturization may allow for faster and easier inspections of complex machinery.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of solid-state, miniaturized dielectric elastomer actuator (DEAs) inspection robots. This dielectric elastomer actuator navigation technology overcomes the challenge of tendon driven systems, which are limited by friction. Navigation using miniaturized complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors allows access to narrow points, beyond the limit of conventional borescopes. In addition, the strategy for building solid state DEAs and connecting them with small metallic wires enables multi-degree-of-freedom end effectors. The result is a solid-state inspection tool that does not have friction limitations and can carry smaller cameras than existing borescopes. This technology may have application in inspection of complex industrial components such as jet engines, exploration of unstructured environments such as earthquake damaged buildings, or medical applications such as a steerable catheter for navigation inside the body. This technology may improve the inspection process by improving the speed of performing inspections as well as the ability to reach previously inaccessible points.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge is to create algorithms that can analyze these datasets efficiently while also providing guarantees on the quality of the analysis. This project focuses on iterative algorithms that start with an initial guess and then refine it until they reach a solution of the desired quality. Prior work has made it possible to design efficient iterative algorithms with excellent performance guarantees, under the assumption that all of the data is processed synchronously, without any losses or errors. However, large datasets often need to be distributed across multiple servers, leading to asynchronous updates, partial losses, and errors. The main contribution of this project is a novel framework for the design and analysis of iterative algorithms that process very large datasets in a distributed fashion. This framework naturally captures many of the phenomena that arise in distributed data processing, and can be used to design strategies that are more efficient than requiring the servers to maintain perfect synchronization. Furthermore, this research will train undergraduate and graduate students to be experts on distributed processing of massive datasets. It will also lead to the creation of educational materials, such as tutorial articles, focused on the statistical analysis of massive datasets.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, this project builds on the approximate message passing framework, which is an established methodology for precise probabilistic characterizations of iterative inference algorithms, such as matrix estimation and linear regression, in the high-dimensional setting. The project will expand the approximate message passing framework to scenarios with distributed, dynamic, and stochastic data processing. This framework will be used to create iterative algorithms that can handle partial updates, distributed computation, and dynamic data, as well as to maximize the efficiency of these algorithms, in terms of the number of iterations or the overall compute budget. The project will also explore a new proof technique based on Gaussian coupling in order to provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the performance of approximate message passing with long-term memory, non-separable denoising functions, and very high iteration counts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This network manager allocates communication services (CS), such as bandwidth, reliability, and latency, to each agent, enabling sensors to transmit data to their respective controllers. For optimal NMS performance, the problem must be jointly studied at the agent level and the network level. Agents need to design communication-aware controllers, while the network manager must allocate communication services in a control-aware manner. Specifically, agents must develop controllers that proactively incorporate allocated communication services, analyzing their impact on sensor data quality, timing, and resolution. Simultaneously, the network manager must dynamically allocate communication resources to meet agents' evolving needs while ensuring fairness in allocations across all agents. At its core, this problem requires developing an optimal control-communication theory to guide decision-making for both agents and the network manager. The proposal envisions enabling optimal decision-making for NMS across various domains: from enhancing coordination and cooperation in multi-robot systems to optimizing information exchange among connected and autonomous vehicles to voltage and frequency control in power-grids.  With advancements in communication and networking technologies, communication-aware controllers are especially important for real-world applications, offering improved performance, reliability, and resource utilization. The educational objectives of this proposal aim to ignite interest in NMS and control systems in general, while the outreach activities are designed to inspire K-12 students to pursue STEM education.<br/><br/>This proposal systematically investigates NMS operations at both agent and network levels. The first contribution is a principled control-communication theory that addresses the challenges of designing CS-aware controllers and control-aware CS allocations. This theory enables tradeoff and sensitivity analyses within the CS parameter space, answering questions such as whether one parameter (e.g., latency) can compensate for another (e.g., bandwidth). It provides insights into which parameter has the most significant impact under varying conditions, allowing the network manager to allocate resources effectively. The research extends beyond agent and network levels by examining environmental impacts on CS allocations.

The material is produced from renewable feedstocks such as wood and agricultural waste using a combination of freeze?thaw toughening, solvent exchange, and ambient drying to produce monolithic structures with extremely low density and high surface area. In addition, the material is functionalized with amino acids and peptides to enhance CO? affinity without the need for corrosive or toxic chemicals. This structural and chemical synergy enables reversible CO? adsorption, efficient regeneration, and a long operational lifespan. Unlike traditional amine-based technologies, this material does not require special reactors, uses no hazardous solvents, and avoids high energy input during manufacturing. Laboratory demonstrations show competitive CO? uptake (~1 mmol/g), with additional potential in passive capture and closed-environment applications. This material may have applications beyond CO? capture, including superabsorbents, air and water filtration, oil remediation, and thermal insulation, and can be safely composted or used as fertilizer at the end of its use cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Brooks Range of northern Alaska, slow-moving, frozen landslides (Frozen Debris Lobes; FDLs) are becoming noticeably more active, and they now threaten critical infrastructure like the Trans Alaska Pipeline and Dalton Highway. Unlike other sectors of the cryosphere (glaciers, sea ice), little is known about how responsive frozen mass movements have been to past episodes of climate warming and cooling. For instance, it is unknown when today?s period of enhanced mass movement began in the southern Brooks Range, what climatic conditions triggered it, and how unusual it is compared to the last several centuries. Moreover, a lack of knowledge about how topography and land cover influence the climate sensitivity of frozen mass movements has prevented researchers from predicting where and when new mass movements may emerge in our warmer future. The main aim of this project is to use geomorphic monitoring, remote sensing, and the growth records of trees growing atop FDLs to determine the seasonality and interannual variability of FDL instability over the last ~300 yrs. By comparing reconstructed FDL instability with remote sensing and climate records, researchers will use the past climate sensitivity of these natural hazards to assess the future risk they pose as Arctic warming accelerates.  <br/><br/>This project will focus on actively moving FDLs in the Central Brooks Range, some of which encroach upon the Dalton Highway and the Trans Alaska Pipeline System corridor. Preliminary tree-ring data indicate that episodes of ground instability associated with FDL movement are recorded in the annual records of the old-growth white spruce trees growing on the FDLs. For the long-term reconstruction of FDL dynamics, researchers will use dendrogeomorphic techniques on 15 FDLs to generate annually resolved records of multi-centennial FDL instability. To monitor sub-seasonal ground movement and tree-growth variability, dendrometers, tiltmeters, and on-site climate records will be used at one FDL location. Quantitative wood anatomy will also be used to detail the seasonality of past movement episodes. Remote sensing will be employed to assess interannual rates of movement in ~160 FDLs in the region since 1955. Daily historical and gridded monthly climate data as well as topo-geomorphic parameters will be fed into a Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling Framework to aggregate site reconstructions and to derive regional trends/drivers of FDL behavior. This project will test three hypotheses: (i) FDL instability is sensitive to changes in air temperature and precipitation, including snow accumulation and heavy summer rainstorms; (ii) the extent/rate of FDL instability was first enhanced during post-Little Ice Age warming; (iii) recent instability is unprecedented both in extent and rate over the past 300 yrs. As FDL activity is thought to be a harbinger of more widespread slope instability in the Arctic, these results will help answer the fundamental question of how Arctic landscapes respond to ongoing change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon fiber is widely used in industries including aerospace, automotive, and energy generation due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, which boosts both fuel efficiency and performance. Advances in additive manufacturing have enabled the use of carbon dioxide as the feedstock for carbon fiber production, eliminating the need for the expensive polymer precursor used by industry incumbents. This new production method significantly reduces the production temperature from ~1000°C (polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon fibers) to ~750°C (carbon dioxide-derived carbon fiber), allowing for a significant reduction in the production cost of carbon fiber. The new product is nearing the performance specs of popular chopped carbon fiber offerings, while significantly reducing production costs. In addition to being both cost competitive and carbon negative, this new method of producing carbon fiber through the utilization of advances in additive manufacturing has the potential to significantly increase the U.S. domestic production of carbon fiber, adding supply chain security. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a novel process that converts carbon dioxide (CO?) into high-performance carbon fiber using molten carbonate electrolysis. The system electrolytically reduces CO? gas?sourced from industrial waste streams or direct air capture?into solid elemental carbon at the cathode, while oxygen evolves at the anode. By controlling current density, electrolysis potential, and electrolyte composition, the process enables the deposition of aligned carbon structures suitable for fiber extrusion. These carbon deposits are continuously drawn from the melt using a liquid-metal-assisted nozzle, allowing control over fiber diameter, morphology, and mechanical properties. Scientific advances in high-temperature electrochemistry, cathode surface engineering, and phase-selective carbon growth enable the formation of a graphitic carbon aligned along the draw axis. The resulting material exhibits tunable modulus and strength characteristics, targeting applications in composites, lightweight structures, and conductive media. By turning CO??a waste product of several industrial processes?into a valuable structural material, this technology offers both economic and environmental benefits. This transformative approach redefines carbon fiber manufacturing for aerospace, automotive, and industrial markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to functionalize strong and prevalent C?H bonds is a contemporary challenge in synthetic chemistry. Scientific advances in the area of transition metal (TM) catalyzed directed C?H functionalization reactions are limited to mono-functionalization using difficult-to-remove directing groups (DG). Moreover, the planarity of the employed DGs does not allow for spatial control, and functionalization is limited to predisposed C?H bonds based on favorable organometallic cycles. The research team will investigate the merger of photochromism and TM?catalyzed C?H functionalization to empower directional control of DGs to enable last-stage C?H difunctionalization at different spatial sites of the molecule. The ability to utilize photochromic DGs for positional controlled C?H functionalization has the potential to expedite the synthesis of important synthetic cores in a highly selective and diverse manner, thereby solving a prominent challenge in synthesis. The education and outreach activities will focus on increasing STEM interest through the development of research-based STEM laboratory classes for undergraduate and high-school students. For graduate students, a non-technical seminar focusing on a speaker?s career journey toward achieving their scientific career goals will be carried out. Lastly, a social/networking triannual symposium with the organic divisions of local New York City universities will be created to promote scientific interactions with graduate students and postdocs.<br/> <br/>In this work, Dr. Parasram leverages the interplay between photochromism and TM-catalyzed directed C?H functionalization to enable spatial selective C?H difunctionalization of organic molecules.

Objective 1 explores the use of innate functional groups as photoswitchable DGs to facilitate two separate and spatially different C?H functionalization events, allowing for the multivectorization of organic motifs in a highly selective and efficient manner. Methods to carry out this approach asymmetrically using chiral ligands, and applications to access molecular scaffolds of biological interest including natural products will be explored. Objective 2 investigates the use of designer photochromic DGs for the difunctionalization of heterocyclic motifs. The directionality control of the photochromic DGs can enable the functionalization of unconventional C?H sites on heterocycles, thus, solving a longstanding problem in the field.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To ensure national security, there is need to control all aspects of chip design, manufacturing, and integration. However, bringing chip manufacturing back to the US requires a significant increase in skilled workers, including technicians, engineers, scientists, and support staff. Chip manufacturing processes involve complex modeling and simulation tools, which are not commonly used in education today. Only a small number of universities in the US currently educate integrated circuit (IC)  design engineers, and even tripling their enrollments won't meet the workforce demand. More universities need to be enabled to teach chip design. Many research institutions face challenges such as lack of Information Technology (IT), legal, and hardware support, educational materials, and experienced instructors. Chipshub will be a National Chip Design Hub for all US universities and colleges, providing education and training that is critical to bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. <br/><br/>Chipshub will overcome challenges that span (1) content/products: creation of appropriate and sharable educational and tool content; (2) infrastructure/market: secure, scalable, seamless, user-friendly, well-supported, and sustainable web delivery of the content; (3) users/customers: reaching, engaging, incentivizing, and training faculty to teach and/or conduct research in IC design; and (4) sustainability through community building and growth across partners, users, and content providers. Chipshub will robustly and sustainably meet the key requirements for a national chip design hub, including licensing, access, and maintenance of commercial and open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tools for end-to-end chip design and verification; secure cloud-based availability of process design kits that span from open-source nodes to emerging technologies; and paths to multi-project (i.e., shuttle) integration.

However, traditional approaches to construct N?N bonds are significantly limited by the types of products that they can provide. The Lin lab aims to develop a new reagent that can selectively couple two molecules containing amines, which are readily available species from feedstock chemicals and naturally occurring compounds. The long-term objective of this research program is to facilitate the development of new medicines, agrochemicals, and light-responsive materials. The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and physical organic chemistry. Therefore, it is also well suited for the education of trainees including graduate and undergraduate students. In addition to contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge and improving fine chemical preparation, the project will also exert broader impacts on the training of students through collaboration with other laboratories with complementary expertise.<br/><br/>Professor Song Lin is studying the development of reaction methodologies using novel hypervalent iodine agents for the selective coupling of amines. N?N bonds are prevalent in bioactive natural products, medicinal agents, agrochemicals, and functional materials. An efficient and modular approach to synthesizing N?N containing molecules is the direct coupling of two N-containing fragments. Currently available protocols for N?N coupling predominantly focus on amides, imines, or arylamines as substrates. The direct coupling of unactivated aliphatic amines would drastically improve the synthetic scope of this bond disconnection strategy but such transformations remain elusive. To this end, the Lin lab will develop hypervalent iodine reagents with labile ligands to promote N?N coupling reactions to access important target products, including natural products, medicinal agents, and photoresponsive materials.

Modern electric grids face challenges due to the increased number of various kinds of energy resources with added uncertainties. These include low fault currents, bidirectional power flow, and non-linear electrical behaviors that limit the effectiveness of traditional protection systems. Furthermore, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events poses significant threats to the reliability of the power grid. To address these challenges, this NSF ERI project will develop a novel real-time digital signal processing theory, offering a transformative new approach to capturing and analyzing rapid electrical phenomena that conventional techniques cannot resolve. This new theory will result in advanced diagnostic tools capable of identifying and responding to faults in complex power systems with unprecedented speed and accuracy.  The intellectual merit of this project includes:  development of wavelet theory with the ability to eliminate time delays in real-time signal decomposition and reconstruction, as well as sensitivity to small signal changes; integration with machine learning to enable classifying faults with microsecond-level<br/>precision. Additionally, the proposed framework introduces a unique capability to predict faults and enable early corrective actions, thereby improving system resilience against cascading failures.  The broader impacts of this project include educational and outreach components that engage students and the public through hands-on learning, YouTube-based educational series, and summer youth programs, supporting workforce development in a rapidly evolving energy sector.<br/><br/>This project will advance the mathematical foundation of real-time wavelet transform theory to overcome limitations in conventional digital signal processing techniques. Methods based on this new theory will be developed to improve the detection of high-impedance faults, fault-induced transients, and low-frequency harmonic distortion, particularly in inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated and high-voltage DC systems. The research will span two interrelated thrusts: (1) the development of an innovative real-time wavelet transform theory capable of handling dynamic, multi-scale electrical signals with no time delay, and (2) the design of an integrated fault diagnosis framework that leverages this theory to achieve rapid fault prediction, classification, and location in both AC and DC systems. Algorithms will be tested through simulations, real-world data, and experimental validation using a unique laboratory testbed with renewable integration. The outcomes will include open-source tools and scalable methodologies suitable for real-time deployment in protective relays and control systems. These innovations will advance the state-of-the-art in real-time signal processing and power system protection and contribute to improved grid reliability under extreme operating conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past engineering projects have, collectively, enabled the prosperous economies of deltaic regions that are enjoyed today, but have also created conditions that limit the regions in the future. In many places, including along the United States Gulf Coast, planners and governments are implementing new projects that aim to restore coastal changes, enhance economic and environmental support, and mitigate risk to human lives and livelihoods. However, there is not a robust understanding of how past delta management has influenced human decisions and outcomes. This project uses novel numerical and computational modeling approaches to study how human engineering decisions cascade through space and time over centuries of landscape change to create system conditions that limit or enhance the portfolio of management decisions available at future times. This work develops tools with coastal planners to determine the portfolio of projects that maximize coastal survival.<br/><br/>Delta engineering projects induce geomorphic change across space and time scales that impacts human lives and society. This project integrates cascading human decision making into landscape evolution models with three modeling approaches that inform one another and have complementary strengths: agent-based modeling, dynamical system modeling, and participatory modeling. Project research focuses on two testable hypotheses towards the tools and quantitative understanding of cascading decision making that are needed for delta planning: (1) local-scale engineering interventions can lead to less geomorphologically stable delta landscapes, when compared to a few larger system-scale interventions, and (2) human decisions can push the coupled system across tipping points, to both system benefit and detriment. Finally, research and development across all modeling approaches in this project is guided by community engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cybersecurity data sharing comes primarily in the form of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that describe patterns or artifacts that have already been classified as associated with malicious activity.  Identifying malicious activity and distilling one or more IoCs from it, however, is often a manual process that is slowed and/or decayed by the siloed viewpoints of different organizations.  This project's broader significance and importance are in pioneering a new approach to organizational data sharing that prioritizes support for targeted queries on the operational states of other organizations to overcome these siloed viewpoints.  This project's novelties are in identifying opportunities for organizations to diagnose events by posing and responding to such queries and in developing technologies to do so, while simultaneously protecting operational privacy for the organizations.<br/><br/>The technical core of this project is a new approach to intrusion detection enabled by cross-organization queries, supported by specialized cryptographic protocols to pose queries and receive responses in a way that minimizes collateral leakage.

This project couples these technical advances with engagement with the operational cybersecurity community via the Workshop on Security Operations Center (SOC) Operations and Construction (WOSOC) and with foci on integrating this research into educational efforts at the investigators' institutions and in engaging students in research.

Despite this tremendous success, many computational problems relevant to rapidly advancing fields such as machine learning, biotechnology, and resource optimization continue to challenge these platforms in terms of performance and efficiency. With the ever-increasing demand for computation and the slowing down of Moore?s law, there is a strong impetus to explore alternate computing paradigms and hardware platforms to solve such problems more efficiently. Probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based computing platforms, which exhibit characteristics starkly different from the deterministic behavior of digital bits, offer a promising pathway in such scenarios. However, current p-bit-based computing platforms have focused on a narrow set of functionalities, thereby limiting their broader potential. The goal of this project is to develop PRSIM, a new probabilistic computing engine with novel functional capabilities that can transform the efficacy of probabilistic computing. These advancements will be enabled and supported by novel probabilistic hardware realized using oscillator networks. PRISM will facilitate fundamental advances in probabilistic computing that will help overcome the constraints of existing platforms. These advancements will also have transformative downstream benefits for practical applications that require solving such problems.<br/><br/>Computing platforms based on p-bits provide a natural hardware solution for accelerating Monte Carlo algorithms, a powerful tool for solving computationally intractable problems efficiently. However, existing platforms employ p-bits which are designed to probabilistically switch only between two states. This limitation can hinder the functional and performance capabilities of such platforms, especially when addressing problems that require more than two states. Currently, solving such problems necessitates computationally expensive pre-processing techniques just to make the problem compatible with the underlying p-bit platform, which increases the effective problem size on hardware and may degrade the solution quality. This project proposes to develop and demonstrate PRISM, a new computing platform using p-bits that are capable of probabilistic switching between multiple states. To enable this, PRISM introduces a novel hardware implementation based on oscillators and their networks which are capable of supporting multi-state p-bits. The PRISM platform facilitates direct mapping of a broad class of computationally hard problems that entail more than two states. This enhances performance and efficiency by eliminating the traditional overhead associated with solving such problems using two-state p-bit engines. The PRISM platform will be developed through a cross-cutting effort that spans both hardware and algorithm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project addresses a critical gap in surgical education by providing a reusable, radiation free, and cost-effective alternative to traditional education methods such as cadaver labs and live patient instruction. This simulator recreates common orthopedic trauma scenarios using anatomically accurate models and real surgical tools, allowing residents to develop technical skills in a low-risk and repeatable environment. A built-in three-dimensional tracking system enables precise simulated X-ray imaging, a core component of orthopedic procedures, while also providing automated performance assessments for objective feedback and skill benchmarking. This approach supports measurable learning outcomes and the establishment of national competency standards. The need for such technology is underscored by recent mandates for simulation-based training in residency programs and the growing emphasis on hands-on, data-driven education to improve patient safety and surgical outcomes. This project promotes the advancement of medical education across diverse training environments, particularly benefiting institutions with limited access to cadaveric or operating room-based instruction and ultimately contributes to national health and welfare by strengthening surgical training and preparing future surgeons for safe, effective clinical practice. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a high-fidelity orthopedic simulation platform that integrates anatomically accurate surgical models and real surgical tools with an electromagnetic 3D tracking system. Together, this enables sub-millimeter tracking of surgical tools and anatomical models, provides radiation-free simulation of intraoperative imaging, and captures quantitative metrics such as procedural efficiency, accuracy, tool-to-bone interactions, and decision-making abilities. These data-driven insights enhance learning by providing objective feedback and performance benchmarking against other residents and expert surgeons. Unlike conventional training solutions, which lack objective assessment or real-world tool dynamics, this platform merges physical and digital components to create a scalable and modular training environment with high surgical accuracy. The approach builds on advancements in simulation, image-guided surgical navigation, and real-time tracking systems to produce a product with immediate applicability in residency programs. Its technical innovation and focus on measurable outcomes establish a new benchmark in surgical education, with potential to expand into other image-guided procedural specialties such as neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and general surgery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project, by leveraging the power of foundation models, which are large deep learning models trained on extensive datasets of images and text, looks to automate extraction and analysis of key building features. Furthermore, value of the developed models will be evaluated by assessing how well such features align with need hierarchies derived from a curated database of lived experiences during past flood events.

As these technologies become integral to transportation, warehouse logistics, and healthcare, ensuring human safety is paramount. The complexity of real-world environments, however, are shaped by complex and uncertain factors such as social behaviors and contextual cues, which presents significant challenges in assessing and guaranteeing safety. The research activities funded by this award will intend to develop interpretable, data-driven safety models that are crucial for explaining safety incidents and related human perceptions in environments where autonomous systems operate. These models are intended to enhance predictability, improve operational efficiency, and minimize safety risks, thereby optimizing human-system interactions. Educational and outreach efforts funded by this award include collaboration with Harborview Medical Center to deploy safety algorithms in hospital environments, improving patient care. Additional, educational curricula will be enriched with practical safety experiences to enhance pre-engineering math courses at Shoreline Community College. These initiatives will prepare future innovators and regulators to develop and manage trusted autonomous systems.<br/><br/>Determining the safety of given scenarios, or the ?safety landscape,? involves challenges from uncertainty, social norms, contextual cues, and feedback interactions. The safety-critical nature of human-robot interactions requires data-driven models to be interpretable for regulatory compliance, explainability, and predictability. This research develops a data-driven framework with control-theoretic foundations to address these complexities and provide clear outputs for decision-making and control. The research encompasses three thrusts: (i) data generation, designing systems for collecting safety-critical data; (ii) analysis and modeling, using control-theoretic techniques to decode complex interactions; and (iii) control synthesis, creating socially-aware strategies for safer interactions. The data-driven framework will be evaluated using public human navigation datasets, simulated human-in-the-loop experiments, and real-world testing at a hospital research facility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world, forming the backbone of critical infrastructure such as buildings, power plants, bridges, highways, and dams. However, cracking in concrete remains a persistent and costly issue, leading to shortened service life, frequent repairs, and significant disruptions. In the U.S. alone, billions of dollars are spent annually on maintaining and repairing aging concrete infrastructure. These repairs not only incur direct financial costs but also cause indirect losses through downtime, traffic delays, and reduced community resilience. This technology provides a solution by embedding self-healing fibers into concrete, enabling self-repair of cracks in concrete without external intervention. In addition, this innovation has the potential to reduce maintenance needs, extend infrastructure lifespan, and minimize service interruptions. The commercial impact spans construction, transportation, energy, and defense sectors where durable and low-maintenance concrete infrastructure is critical. This technology also may enhance the resilience of communities by ensuring safer, longer-lasting structures and reducing the economic and logistical burdens associated with frequent repair and reconstruction.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of adding multifunctional, polymer-based, self-healing fibers to concrete. The fibers are made multifunctional using a three-in-one solution design to enhance fracture resistance, enable damage-responsive activation, and deliver autonomous self-healing in concrete. This solution is accomplished by functionalizing polymeric fibers with a micron-thick alginate-based hydrogel layer containing healing agents, including bacterial spores. The hydrogel layer is encapsulated within an outer protective shell that is tunable and strain responsive. The protective shell prevents premature activation during normal concrete service conditions and ensures targeted healing activation only when a crack occurs. The functionalized fiber is designed to enable selective and efficient self-repair and also enhances mechanical performance of concrete systems through fiber reinforcement. Unlike other self-healing systems, such as microcapsule-based technologies that lack structural reinforcement and activate indiscriminately, this technology maintains the load-bearing capabilities of commercial polymer fibers while adding tunable healing functionality. The underlying research includes advanced manufacturing, materials synthesis, coating stability, and mechanical testing in cementitious composites that demonstrate the mechanical performance and controlled healing behavior of the fiber. This technology may extend the lifespan of concrete infrastructure and improve the resilience of built environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photonic devices are components that generate, manipulate, or detect light (photons) for various applications.  The photonic devices have improved performance and reduced costs compared to electronic devices, but the cost of photonic device packaging and power loss minimization are hindering widespread adoption.  This project will enable customers to package optical devices with high efficiency, low cost, and at high volumes.

The development of the PIX Attach machine, an advanced semiconductor packaging and assembly tool used for photonic integrated circuits, will enable users to fuse the optical fiber to the chip with the press of a button, dramatically decreasing the time it takes to package a single chip while creating a better performing device. With simple processes for the user to initiate fusion and fast physical attachment of the fiber, the technology will save customers? time and money, enabling the production of more photonic devices in the same amount of time with improved specifications. A process design kit will be developed for a novel mode converter element, which has been found to decrease losses when packaged either with traditional methods or with a preliminary version of the PIX Attach machine.

Composite materials for battery electrodes offer higher energy and power densities compared to single-material electrodes. One compelling example is represented by silicon/graphite (Si/C) composite anodes due to silicon?s exceptionally high theoretical specific capacity ? nearly 10 times greater than that of commercially dominant graphite anodes. However, the inclusion of silicon presents complications caused by significant volume expansion during battery charging and rapid capacity fade, leading to safety risks, environmental concerns, and economic loss. A significant knowledge gap persists in understanding the fundamental physical interplay within battery composite anodes necessary to mitigate long-term battery degradation. This project will fund research that attempts to address these challenges by developing a holistic modeling and control framework to unveil how changes in the composite material structure, both during charging/discharging and over extended usage, affect battery performance, safety, and degradation. Shedding light on the nature of these challenges will help accelerate transition to a more sustainable energy storage landscape.

How these flows interact with surfaces with varying natural or engineered texture is often a determining factor for process reliability and efficiency. However, the results of such multiphase flow and surface interactions are most often described based on fits to data that are only applicable to the specific application over a narrow range of conditions. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to discover universal dependencies in such complex flows utilizing highly repeatable experiments studying liquid jet impingent on well-characterized textured engineered surfaces. The project also includes significant educational activity by providing undergraduate research opportunities and incorporates scalable outreach that will benefit the scientific and technical education of high school students as well.<br/><br/>The engineering community?s fundamental understanding is very limited when it comes to the interaction of multiphase flows with complex surfaces, defined here as surfaces with (spatially or sample-to-sample) varying hydrophobicity and roughness. Such surfaces, when appropriately designed and fabricated, can also retain microscopic pockets of gas (called plastrons) whose state is a function of the flow they are exposed to, and which greatly impact the overall flow dynamics as shown by our preliminary study. This research builds upon the PIs? prior published work on a complementary study and expands on the preliminary data yielded by the experimental jet impingement method we have developed. Guided by jet impingement and interfacial thermodynamic theories, these methods will be utilized to study boundary layer growth, wetting, and dewetting on random and structured surfaces with varying degrees of hydrophobicity. Elucidating the role of roughness, varying hydrophobicity and state of plastrons on the dynamics of impinging jets, and dewetting in case of gravity vector normal to surface outward, will contribute to the community's understanding of multiphase flow boundary layer flows ? in addition to the enhanced understanding of the interaction of impinging jets on complex surfaces, which alone is an important topic of research. The fundamental understanding that the proposed research will contribute to can be readily utilized in numerous applications and have a broad societal impact in the near-term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The product is in the form of a compressible, absorbent and insoluble foam composed of starch, chitosan and glycerol. This solution is completely bioabsorbable and as it absorbs blood and wound extrudates, it slowly transitions into an insoluble gel at the interface between the wound and foam. The biofoam?s physical properties in conjunction with its bioabsorbability allows it to be removed from the wound site without disturbing a clot or healing tissue.

This solution is based on the development of an insoluble hemostatic foam comprised of starch, chitosan and glycerol. Insolubility is achieved through the formation of a polysaccharide polyelectrolyte complex of anionic potato starch and cationic chitosan. Chitosan is a key component as it aggregates red blood cells and stimulates clotting. The foam is made soft through the incorporation of glycerol which acts as a plasticizer. The material is distinct from other products as it is stable, compressible, bioabsorbable, and hemostatic. The form can be made in many shapes and sizes, is simple to use, can be packaged compressed in a flat pack and stored for years without any special environmental requirements.

Classical computers often fail to solve hard optimization problems such as these, and thus one of the major research directions in quantum computing is to determine whether certain quantum computers might be significantly more effective ? if so, the implications for countless fields would be transformative. The standard approach for leveraging quantum fluctuations to better solve optimization problems is termed ?adiabatic quantum <br/>computation? (AQC). Unfortunately, despite some encouraging initial studies, it is now understood that conventional AQC is likely to struggle for similar reasons as do classical algorithms. As a result, recent research in the topic has turned towards intelligent modifications to AQC ? termed ?catalysts? ? that are intended to circumvent the difficulties faced by the conventional approach. This project will apply tools and ideas from statistical physics to elucidate the potential and limitations of such catalysts. Just as the physics-based method has led to a better understanding of conventional AQC, so will it here inform the development of the next generation of quantum-computing algorithms for optimization problems. <br/><br/>More precisely, the awarded work consists of two major thrusts. First is to investigate whether catalysts proposed in the literature continue to show an advantage when applied to spin-glass models (the statistical-physics analogues of hard optimization problems), and to identify the physical mechanisms underlying those successes and/or failures. Second is to apply that understanding to develop improvements to the catalysts which address their weaknesses. Since the difficulty of optimization problems can be described in physical terms via their ?free energy landscapes?, a central concept in statistical physics, this project will specifically use techniques from that field ? path integrals, mean-field decouplings, the replica method ? to calculate the landscapes in canonical spin-glass models and quantify the manner in which different catalysts modify said landscapes, as well as characterize their robustness to imperfections such as finite temperature and noise. This will in turn identify which features of the catalysts are essential to their functioning and which are extraneous, thus informing how best to adapt the catalysts to different applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current industry standards rely on static, averaged wind load assumptions that oversimplify the unpredictable and complex nature of wind loads. This research project will challenge these assumptions by introducing innovative random wind load models that capture distinctive collapse mechanisms of TTL systems. By integrating these wind load models into advanced computational simulations of how tower failures propagate under wind-induced collapse, the research intends to advance the design and risk assessment of TTL systems. The outcomes of this work intend to provide safer, more robust power grid infrastructure, enhancing energy security and reducing blackout risks during hurricanes. Broader impacts will include the development of educational resources that promote hands-on, experiential learning in wind engineering design. By advancing the technical design of transmission towers and integrating the research with educational and outreach activities, this project will promote the national welfare in energy security, infrastructure resilience, and workforce development. This project will contribute to NSF's role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to model the progressive collapse of high-voltage TTL systems under extreme wind loads with high accuracy and low computational cost. Since the progressive failure path of TTL systems has been proven to be sensitive to stochastic wind loads, this research will first develop multivariate statistical models to capture stochastic wind load patterns along the height of transmission towers. To support this effort, novel panel-wise high-frequency base balance experiments will be conducted at the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel at the University of Florida to calibrate wind load models and validate the feasibility of using nodal force representations for wind loads on individual tower panels. Building on these models, the project will introduce three new progressive collapse modeling procedures for wind engineering: (1) static collapse analysis with normative wind load, (2) static collapse analysis with stochastic wind load, and (3) dynamic collapse analysis with temporal wind loads. These procedures will enable the modeling of cascading failures as forces redistribute in real time after localized damage. By addressing the entire spectrum of collapse pathways, from initial localized element failures to large-scale system collapse, this project will advance the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of risk assessment methods for power grid infrastructure. The expected outcomes include (1) the development of stochastic wind load models that support performance-based design, (2) the creation of progressive collapse analysis procedures that enable real-time force redistribution modeling under wind loads, (3) the introduction of new damage measures that link tower collapse to power delivery functionality, and (4) the production of systems-level fragility models that quantify regional blackout risk for large-scale power grids. These contributions will challenge the reliance on normative wind load assumptions in transmission tower design, paving the way for performance-based wind engineering practices. The impact of the research will extend to power grid resilience, as the integration of stochastic wind loads and progressive collapse modeling will reduce uncertainty in risk assessments, improve infrastructure safety, and support the development of next-generation transmission towers designed for hurricane resilience.

Cybersecurity data sharing comes primarily in the form of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that describe patterns or artifacts that have already been classified as associated with malicious activity.  Identifying malicious activity and distilling one or more IoCs from it, however, is often a manual process that is slowed and/or decayed by the siloed viewpoints of different organizations.  This project's broader significance and importance are in pioneering a new approach to organizational data sharing that prioritizes support for targeted queries on the operational states of other organizations to overcome these siloed viewpoints.  This project's novelties are in identifying opportunities for organizations to diagnose events by posing and responding to such queries and in developing technologies to do so, while simultaneously protecting operational privacy for the organizations.<br/><br/>The technical core of this project is a new approach to intrusion detection enabled by cross-organization queries, supported by specialized cryptographic protocols to pose queries and receive responses in a way that minimizes collateral leakage.  The project also contributes novel mechanisms to motivate participation in these data exchanges, and to prioritize the partners to which queries should be posed to receive the highest-quality answers.  This project couples these technical advances with engagement with the operational cybersecurity community via the Workshop on Security Operations Center (SOC) Operations and Construction (WOSOC) and with foci on integrating this research into educational efforts at the investigators' institutions and in engaging students in research.

The fundamental results of Kohn, Hohenberg, and Sham showed that the ground-state energy from the Schrodinger equation is a unique functional of the electron density and subsequently reduced solving a complicated many-body problem to finding a consistent solution to a set of single-particle equations. However, the exact density functional is not known and scientists have developed hundreds of density functional approximations (DFAs). Choosing a DFA is perhaps the most important decision when performing a DFT calculation. The project's novelties are in using formal methods to ensure that the implementation of a DFA is provably correct. DFT calculations are widely used in a number of scientific and engineering fields, including solid state physics, computational chemistry, and materials science. Consequently, the project's impacts are in improving the correctness of scientific software in these application domains. <br/><br/>The key insight of the project is that each DFA is a mathematical function with a known, albeit complicated, analytical form, and, hence, can be analyzed using formal-methods techniques such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers. The project will automatically verify whether a DFA implementation satisfies DFT exact conditions (known analytical properties of the exact functional). The project will automatically verify numerical properties of a DFA implementation (generation of Not a Number (NaN) and infinities, and numerical instabilities slowing down convergence). The project will develop techniques to generate provably correct minimal edits to a DFA implementation that are guaranteed to be numerically stable and continue to satisfy the same exact conditions. By analyzing existing DFAs and developing new DFAs, the project will have tremendous impact in a number of scientific and engineering fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, the success of interventions to disrupt trafficking networks and the availability of support services for survivors are deeply interconnected: access to services influences the effectiveness of interdictions which, in turn, affects the number of survivors seeking services. This project will develop novel analytical decision models to stimulate enhanced collaboration among stakeholders, address the interdependencies between interdictions and survivor services, and guide the optimal allocation of limited resources.

Such actuators are important for food handling, wearable devices, surgical tools, and other applications requiring the safe manipulation of easily damaged items. The robotic factory can print an actuator from multiple polymer feedstocks covering a wide range of mechanical properties, in order to custom tailor the component to the needs of the user. Combining multiple materials to achieve a desired result is a challenging process even for human experts, made more difficult when producing novel parts for one-off tasks. Therefore the robotic factory looks to embed an intelligent design capability, using high-fidelity simulations to test and evolve millions of possible solutions. Even the best simulations depend on accurate knowledge of physical parameters. Therefore, after a part is manufactured, the robotic factory looks to test it against the simulator predictions. If the performance is acceptable, the part is used. Otherwise the simulator is recalibrated and the process repeats. With each cycle, the algorithm can explore an increasingly rich design space. To extend the number of iterations that can be performed without human intervention, failed parts are recycled and the material reused. The robotic factory intends to draw on previous results to continually improve the parts it makes. Future generations of robotic factories will produce increasingly complex devices, up to and including fully functional soft robots.<br/><br/>This project seeks to transform the design and discovery of novel soft components and devices.

Material from failed parts will be recovered in an integrated recycling process.

This project is focused on advancing understanding of atmosphere-ocean coupling on mesoscales (100-1000 km) over the Southern Ocean and its impact on the long-term, large-scale climate variability of the region. This addresses a significant gap in the current understanding of mesoscale atmosphere-ocean coupling regarding its role in decadal to multi-decadal climate variability. The Southern Ocean has some of the most continuous and significant mesoscale ocean variability on the planet, motivating the choice to focus on this region. The investigators hypothesize that mesoscale air?sea interaction related sea surface temperature anomalies lead to large-scale reorganization of the mid-latitude jet stream over the Southern Ocean, which in turn feeds back onto the large-scale currents and mesoscale ocean variability in the region. To explore this idea, the investigators will use a hierarchy of coupled climate models of different resolutions and complexities, allowing them to isolate and explore regional-scale processes, as well as examine these processes in conjunction with larger-scale influences. The project?s focus on advancing understanding of climate variability on decadal time scales has strong societal implications. The project also includes the mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students and an early career scientist, as well as an outreach effort with local high school science educators, addressing NSF?s priority to educate the next generation of scientists and the public on important science issues.<br/><br/>The team will take a hierarchical modeling approach, using both the Community Climate System Model v4 (CCSM4), and the intermediate complexity, moist quasi-geostrophic coupled model (MQ-GCM). CCSM4 coupled simulations to be examined by this study include a low-resolution and high-resolution ocean component and an interactive atmospheric ensemble approach established by the team in earlier work. This unique approach to coupled modeling allows the atmospheric noise to be filtered out of the model simulations, which for this study represents the atmospheric feedback from the mesoscale oceanic eddies. Thus, comparing the control simulations with the filtered simulations will help test the team?s hypothesis that feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere on mesoscales affects longer term conditions in both the atmosphere and ocean in the Southern Ocean region. Additional fully coupled and reduced coupled simulations will also be carried out under a doubling of atmospheric CO2 to understand the sensitivity of the multi-scale coupling processes to different background states. By exploring the importance of mesoscale interactions on the climate system, the project addresses a current gap in understanding and creates avenues for model improvement of decadal to multi-decadal climate variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed studies combine elements of synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry with detailed photophysical investigations, allowing for training and education of graduate and undergraduate students with diverse interests for their future careers as scientists. <br/><br/>Early transition metal photosensitizers with long-lived ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states are an emerging class of inorganic chromophores that have found application in photocatalysis, photon upconversion, and biological sensing. The proposed research includes the use of postsynthetic modification of existing molecular architectures to (i) improve performance critical parameters such as stability and solubility in polar solvents; (ii) incorporate anchoring groups for immobilization on metal oxide surfaces, thereby facilitating light-driven hole injection into p-type semiconductors; (iii) explore the influence of molecular symmetry on the optical properties of group 4 photosensitizers (e.g. intersystem crossing rates, lifetimes, and quantum yields) and provide asymmetric complexes to facilitate directional charge transfer upon visible-light excitation; and (iv) explore the chemical space for group 4 photosensitizer design and provide fundamental understanding of the underlying design principles for early transition metal chromophores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project centers around three main projects involving model theory. The first involves solutions of differential and difference equations. These types of equations specify how an object or variable moves with respect to another in a continuous or discrete manner, respectively. Over the last decade, model theory has played a pivotal role in the resolution of several long-standing open problems for algebraic differential equations. This project aims to continue that progress as well as adapt the new methods to solutions of difference equations. The second project aims to develop connections between model theory and machine learning on both a theoretical and practical level. The third main area of this project involves applying the lessons learned from machine learning and difference equations in more general model theoretic settings. These adaptations are expected to lead to fundamental new advances in model theory. This project involves graduate student training.<br/><br/>Model theory has a long history of applications to transcendence results for differential equations. In the last decade, this circle of results has rapidly expanded as model theoretic methods have become more refined. This project seeks to adapt these results to the setting of difference fields, which is expected to have applications in algebraic dynamics via characterizing the invariant subvarieties of algebraic maps of varieties. In model theory, one usually does not study arbitrary first order theories due to well-known wildness phenomena such as undecidability. Because of this, different settings have developed specific techniques in the presence of various tameness principles. Surprisingly, these principles proved to be the key to efficient learnability in several different models of machine learning. This project seeks to continue to develop this growing area of connection while applying cutting edge results from graph theory and combinatorics. The techniques developed in these projects are expected to have bearing on the development of model theory in the area of simple and stable theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) help identify potential cyberattacks, but many rely on Artificial Intelligence techniques that act as ?black boxes,? making their decisions difficult for humans to understand or trust. Security analysts or users do not know what is going on ?under the hood? in these models and do not understand the model's reasons for making predictions. This project aims to improve the transparency of these systems by developing a novel Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique, and using that to develop Explainable Intrusion Detection Systems (X-IDS). The key idea is to  incorporate the time-based patterns inherent in network security data. This will enable security professionals to better understand why an IDS flags certain activities as threats; improving trust, accountability, and decision-making in cybersecurity. By advancing explainable AI for time-sensitive security applications, this project supports national cybersecurity efforts and enhances the reliability of AI-driven defense mechanisms.  In addition, we will develop and publish hands-on lab exercises for K-12 students related to the research.<br/><br/>Our approach is to develop Temporal Eclectic Rule Extraction (TERE), a novel white-box XAI method for IDS. Unlike existing approaches that rely on black-box surrogate models, TERE will extract human-readable decision rules directly from internal neurons in temporal neural networks trained on network data. This will address a critical gap in explainability and trustability by ensuring that the temporal structure of network activity is preserved in the extracted rules, as network activity and attacks are performed using sequences of packets, providing more transparent and interpretable threat detection. A significant challenge in rule extraction is the computational complexity and number of generated rules. Additionally, traditional methods often produce large rule sets that are difficult for security analysts to interpret, limiting their practical use. Optimization strategies will be developed to reduce computational overhead. A key approach will involve the exploration of neural selection algorithms that efficiently identify relevant neurons for rule extraction, minimizing unnecessary computations. Further, techniques to streamline and compress extracted rules will be explored to enhance interpretability while maintaining accuracy. By integrating decision tree-based rule extraction with time-aware enhancements, this project aims to increase explainability and trustability in Explainable Intrusion Detection Systems (X-IDS). The proposed methods will be evaluated on large-scale intrusion detection datasets, assessing their ability to deliver highly accurate, explainable, and trustworthy explanations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers will collect genetic data, including sequencing genomes, for all parrots. These data will be used to build an evolutionary tree of parrots and answer questions about gene transfer between parrot species. This data will also be used to aid conservation efforts by developing forensic DNA barcodes that will help law enforcement correctly identify illegal products made from endangered parrot species.

Large-scale phylogenetic methods often do not account for gene flow, nor do they address the interaction between genomic architecture and phylogenetic signal, which can lead to well-supported but inaccurate evolutionary relationships. This project will reconstruct a nearly complete time-calibrated phylogeny of the clade to assess gene flow across an entire radiation and predict genomic regions prone to biasing phylogenetic estimates. The researchers will generate new genomic resources, including five chromosome-level reference genomes and genomic-scale markers for over 400 previously unsampled taxa. The project aims to test the following hypotheses to make general predictions about the factors causing gene tree discordance and to inform a species-level taxonomic revision: 1) non-monophyletic species are a common feature across the parrot evolutionary tree; 2) non-monophyletic species and weakly supported relationships are associated with a higher prevalence of gene flow that spans millions of years; and 3) genomic architecture is relatively conserved across the parrot radiation and can be used to mitigate the effects of gene flow in phylogenetic inference across temporal scales.

A prominent example is unit commitment, which schedules when each fuel-burning generator in a power system is on and off. Startup and shutdown account for a significant portion of the cost of generation, and they are binary decisions because a generator can only be on or off. The discreteness of unit commitment undermines standard economic mechanisms. In particular, resulting prices are generally too low, so that system operators must make out-of-market uplift payments to keep generators profitable. In general, discreteness such as this can create negative incentives in markets, leading to inefficient investment and decision-making. Research to be completed in association with this project intends to offer a new approach to designing pricing mechanisms in discrete markets, with the focus on power systems and electric vehicle charging. It will produce new tools and deepen understanding of tradeoffs in discrete markets. The project team has expertise in power systems and transportation, optimization, and market design, and will train graduate students with the multidisciplinary perspectives needed for this project.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the use of copositive programming as a tool for designing economic mechanisms for discrete markets. The approach is based on a fundamental result from Burer (2009), which establishes that a mixed-integer linear program can be equivalently represented as a copositive program. Copositive programming is a conic optimization class that is both convex and NP-hard. As such, it does not provide a better way to solve mixed-integer linear programs. However, its convexity does provide a new notion of duality for discrete problems. Therefore, given the copositive representation of a discrete problem like unit commitment, the dual is immediately available in standard form. The dual variables have economic interpretations as shadow prices and can be used to design market mechanisms such as prices and option contracts. Convexity also brings tools like the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, which are helpful for establishing properties such as efficiency, revenue adequacy, and fairness. This project will explore how to use these and other features of copositivity to better understand and design discrete markets. As copositive programming is computationally hard and of relatively recent interest, it does not yet have mature solution techniques. This project also aims to make copositive programming more practical via the use of machine learning-based, distributed, and online algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is motivated by questions that arise in computer science when manipulating relations, in the structure theory of classical algebras, and in the classification of non-standard general algebras. The goal is to combine and extend recent independent advances in these areas to develop a general algebraic toolkit for specifying and analyzing nilpotent algebras, and to apply it to solving key open problems in all these areas.<br/><br/>Developed from the classical notion in group theory, commutator theory in universal algebra is one of the main tools for investigating the structure of algebras via properties of their congruences.

The first goal is a more precise classification of central extensions in congruence modular varieties using the new concept of clonoids. The investigator will then use this to study to what extent known results in the supernilpotent setting generalize to the nilpotent. Specific projects include the Finite Basis Problem, which concerns nilpotent algebras having finitely axiomatizable equational theories, and the development of efficient algorithms for computing in direct powers of algebras with cube terms, which reduces to central extensions based on the investigator's previous work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of its key ideas is to understand a signal through both its time-domain and frequency-domain representations. In theoretical computer science and learning theory, signals often arise in discrete settings with rich structure?for example, as functions on the Hamming cube (i.e., the space of binary strings). Such functions often exhibit low complexity when analyzed through their Fourier expansion or frequency components. Tackling questions in these domains requires a deep understanding of these structured, low-complexity functions, for which Fourier analytic tools have proven useful. As quantum computing rapidly advances, the natural setting shifts from classical bits to qubits, where signals are represented not by functions but by operators that are non-commutative in nature. This introduces new challenges that demand extensions of classical Fourier analysis tools to the quantum setting. Addressing these challenges is the goal of this project. The project will include efforts in training both undergraduate and graduate students through PI?s mentoring role and in serving the research community through organizing conferences and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>This study investigates quantum analogues of low-complexity functions on the Hamming cube, where complexity is measured, for example, by influence, degree, or the number of variables on which a function depends. A central challenge in this context arises when the dimension tends to infinity. Although Fourier analytic tools have proven highly effective for such problems in the classical setting?illustrated by foundational results on Boolean functions by Kahn, Kalai, and Linial, as well as Talagrand, and by dimension-free inequalities originating from the early work of Littlewood, Bohnenblust and Hille?they do not readily extend to the quantum realm due to inherent non-commutativity and the absence of an underlying classical space.

The ancient Greeks studied polytopes such as the Platonic solids as they are ideal to model nature. In modern days, scientists have found many applications of polytopes in diverse fields such as optimization and computer science. This research project focuses on the combinatorial ?invariants? of polytopes. For example, count the number V of vertices, E of edges, and F of facets of an arbitrary 3-dimensional polytope. Then no matter which polytope we choose, we always end up with getting the identity ?V-E+F=2?. The goal of this research project is to develop new methods to study various invariants of polytopes and spheres that arise from face numbers or other combinatorial data. These tools may further extend our understanding of the interplay between combinatorics, algebra, and geometry. <br/><br/>One of the central conjectures in geometric combinatorics was the g-conjecture; that is, to characterize the face numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres of all dimensions. This conjecture was only proved very recently, and its resolution requires deep results from other fields such as commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This project is dedicated to new methods to study polytopes and manifolds with particular geometry or topology. One goal is to investigate various combinatorial models such as the Stanley-Reisner ring and the stress spaces, and how the algebra translates into combinatorial relations among the face number. Another goal is to investigate how preset geometry and topology (for example, central symmetry) affects the combinatorics of polytopes or polyhedral complexes, and vice versa. The project has applications to computer sciences and the PI also plans to develop lecture notes and work with students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Areas of mathematics with physical applications tend to appear in the low levels of the corresponding complexity hierarchy. Passing to higher levels of complexity enables mathematicians to make connections between different areas of mathematics, and to develop productive general theories. There is a corresponding division of the universe of mathematics into an absolute part, where natural questions tend to be resolved by the standard axioms, and a more abstract part where extensions of the standard axiom system are needed to resolve many fundamental questions. The main focus of PI's research is the relationship between these parts. The technical machinery involved in this project includes Cohen's forcing technique, axioms asserting the existence of winning strategies in infinite games, and axioms asserting the existence of infinite objects whose existence cannot be proved from the standard axioms for mathematics. These techniques originate in set theory, which serves as the most commonly accepted foundations for mathematics.  <br/><br/><br/>The PI plans to work on a related collection of projects involving the complexity of sets of real numbers. Two of these projects aim to extend the work published in two of his recent books. The first of these is another book exposing part of W. Hugh Woodin's work on his axiom AD^+. The first part of this book is to be on methods for producing maximal models of AD^+ via strengthenings of Woodin's derived model methods. The second half of the book concerns reversals, methods for showing that a given model of AD^+ arises as a derived model. This approach resolves many basic questions about models of AD^+.  The second project involves applications of the methods of Geometric Set Theory, which is the topic of the PI's book with Jindrich Zapletal. There are many open questions about the relationships between fragments of the Axiom of Choice which appear to be amenable to the techniques developed in this book. The PI plans to use this approach to study discontinuous homomorphisms of the additive group of the real line, probability measures on the integers, and Blackwell determinacy. Another project involves the universally measurable sets of real numbers, those which are measured by every Borel measure on the real line. Despite their fundamental nature, many basic questions about these sets remain open, among them the question of whether it is consistent for every universally measurable set to have the property of Baire. Another project involves using techniques from inner model theory to study canonical inner models derived from strengthenings of first-order logic, such as logics allowing quantifiers for cofinality or stationarity. These models are typically analyzed by understanding which mice they contain, and which mice construct then. Finally, the PI plans to work with Saharon Shelah on an approach to 0-1 laws. Results in this area show that for many natural properties of finite structures, the probability that a finite structure has the property in question approaches either 0 or 1 as the size of the structure approaches infinity. Results in this project show that under natural assumptions 0-1 laws are preserved while adding additional random predicates to the structures in question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased variability in sea ice conditions affects shipping routes, offshore platforms, and coastal regions, creating a need for advanced tools to predict its behavior and inform resilient design strategies. This research seeks to uncover how the microstructural features of sea ice, such as grain size, porosity, and void distribution, influence its ability to withstand forces, such as the pressure exerted by an icebreaker or the stability needed to support offshore platforms, under varying environmental and mechanical loads. By developing a multiscale framework that connects microscale processes to large-scale dynamics, this project will generate insights critical for Arctic navigation, infrastructure design, and climate adaptation. The outcomes of this work will address key challenges at the intersection of geophysical science and engineering. In addition, the knowledge generated has broader relevance to other fields, including rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering. Outreach and education efforts will focus on the theme of ""North in the South,"" engaging students and the public through programs such as virtual reality experiences, and workshops on Arctic science. These initiatives aim to inspire the next generation of researchers and raise awareness of the critical role sea ice plays in the global climate system.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research is to develop and validate multiscale numerical models that link the micromechanics of sea ice to its macroscopic behavior under various environmental conditions.

Among other things, it can be used to place subtle and surprising restrictions on the dynamics of a broad class of systems (think motions of celestial bodies or the molecules in a gas). Understanding the scope of these restrictions and how to effectively utilize them in naturally arising physical systems is an exciting active area of research. In this project, the PI will develop new tools and paradigms to study the quantitative side of symplectic geometry. The PI will also initiate the study of ""digital symplectic geometry"", which aims to link deep geometric tools with numerical simulations and methods from machine learning. In addition, the PI will also be actively involved in various community-building and mentorship activities, including organizing intensive learning retreats for the wider Southern California geometry and topology community and mentoring undergraduates in research projects at the interface of pure and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>In more detail, a central theme is to develop filtered refinements and higher extensions of powerful emerging tools from pseudoholomorphic curve theory (symplectic field theory, Floer homology, Gromov?Witten invariants, Fukaya categories, ...) in order to systematically investigate rigidity and flexibility properties of Hamiltonian flows. Along the way, this project will explore new types of geometric enumerative problems (e.g. multidirectional tangency constraints) whose solutions uncover intriguing connections with algebra and combinatorics (scattering diagrams, Q-Gorenstein smoothings, cluster algebras, quiver representations, ...). Three major components of this project are: (1) undertaking a novel strategy for tackling higher dimensional symplectic ellipsoid embeddings by exploiting links between symplectic field theory and singular algebraic curves and importing ideas from Gross?Siebert mirror symmetry, (2) exploring new frontier research avenues for real-valued invariants called symplectic capacities, notably by pursuing a quantitative theory of Fukaya categories and by pushing higher symplectic capacities into the world of contact geometry, and (3) building a new computational framework called digital symplectic geometry which aims to analyze Hamiltonian dynamics and nonsqueezing phenomena by performing numerical simulations and incorporating methods from computer optimization and machine learning. The projects in this proposal will develop deep and surprising connections between quantitative symplectic geometry and various other areas, including algebraic curve theory, birational geometry, mirror symmetry, and more. For instance, the PI will construct new interesting families of singular algebraic plane curves which also shed light on scattering diagrams arising from cluster algebras and quiver representations. The PI will also develop and exploit connections between symplectic singular Lagrangian fibrations and algebraic deformations of Fano varieties, and to bridge recent work on Weinstein manifolds and their qualitative Fukaya categories with the quantitative theory of symplectic capacities. Furthermore, the proposed projects in digital symplectic geometry aim to create new mechanisms for generating and testing conjectures in Hamiltonian dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A lower cost protein production strain that operates at scale would also support domestic supply chain resiliency and biosecurity. Reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic drugs would make it more economical to re-shore manufacturing of drugs and drug products to the United States from the current low-cost production countries that export to the United States. By manufacturing these drugs in the U.S., this technology could limit future supply chain disruptions caused by pandemics or complications to international trade.

The proposed project will initially benchmark the capabilities of the platform by developing and optimizing industrial scale manufacturing processes for 3 different classes of proteins.

Observations show that the input of freshwater in polar regions from melting glaciers and sea ice has already contributed to weakening ocean circulation. However, our understanding of these processes is limited by the length of observational records; examining previous periods of change can aid this understanding. This project focuses on the Younger Dryas (11.7-12.9 ka), a cold period that abruptly interrupted the Earth?s warming climate during deglaciation. The cause of this cooling is debated, but a leading hypothesis is that freshwater input from glacial lakes to the North Atlantic Ocean slowed ocean circulation. Alternatively, computer models indicate that sea ice export from the Arctic Ocean, traveling along the east coast of Greenland, could have been responsible for triggering the Younger Dryas. Yet, there are currently limited palaeoceanographic data from this region to evaluate this alternate hypothesis. To address this data gap, this project will utilize existing marine sediment cores to reconstruct sea ice and freshwater changes during the Younger Dryas. This research will provide quantitative data to understand what triggered an abrupt slowdown of ocean circulation that resulted in prominent cooling of the Northern Hemisphere. The results will lead to a better understanding of the sensitivity of ocean circulation to the input of freshwater from sea ice export and melt, important for evaluating the potential impact of future melt water release from the Arctic. Additionally, this project was conceived and will be led by a postdoctoral researcher, with support from two established principal investigators. Thus, an early career researcher will develop leadership and supervisory skills, essential to professional development. <br/><br/>This project addresses the hypothesis that ?The Younger Dryas was initiated by the export of Arctic sea ice and freshwater carried by the East Greenland Current?.

This treatment is aimed at cancers involving tumors spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes, but not to distant organs. Currently, over 40,000 cases of liver and pancreatic cancers that cannot be removed by surgery are diagnosed in the U.S., often with poor prognoses and high recurrence rates. This technology provides a targeted, minimally invasive solution that can be integrated into current clinical practice to improve outcomes. The technology is based on removing diseased tissue with light activation, which may enhance survival while reducing treatment-related toxicity. As a result, patients may experience fewer complications and hospitalizations. This technology may help advance cancer care, lower healthcare costs, and expand access to more effective, less toxic therapies for patients with locally advanced disease.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a light-triggered ablation technology for cancer photodynamic therapy. While photodynamic therapy is effective at killing primary tumor cells, addressing tumor spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes remains a challenge, as most cancer deaths result from metastasis. This technology combines two non-heat-based chemical ablative methods that have been proven safe with low adverse effects for unresectable tumors: photodynamic therapy, which involves delivering light-activated, tumor-killing photosensitizers, and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which involves the direct injection of pure ethanol into tumor nodules. This therapy is designed for localized tumors that cannot be surgically removed, such as unresectable liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma. This approach ensures the treatment remains confined to the tumor site, thereby significantly minimizing side effects, compared to standard chemotherapy. Light activation enables localized tumor destruction and may also stimulate immune-mediated tumor killing. When integrated with computerized tomography (CT) imaging, this platform allows real-time monitoring of drug delivery and dosing adjustments, supporting personalized therapy. This technology may advance cancer care and overcome the limitations of current cancer treatments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their relatively consistent structure compared to other cloud structures, like thunderstorm complexes, there is significant small-scale spatial variability in stratocumulus clouds that impacts further cloud and precipitation development.  This project will use an emerging modeling technique and existing cloud observations to identify the sources of spatial variability at the cloud microphysics level.  The research team will then identify the best methods to simulate these sources of variability.  The broader societal impact of the project would be to improve modeling of clouds which affect Earth?s radiation balance.  There is also a substantial educational aspect to the project, enhancing the training of the next generation of atmospheric scientists.<br/><br/>The primary objectives of this project are to understand the microphysical sources of spatial variability in low-level stratocumulus clouds, how this spatial variability influences the temporal evolution of the mean cloud and precipitation processes, and how the design of microphysics parameterizations influences the ability to simulate the observed spatial structure of these cloud and precipitation fields.  The research team will run Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of drizzling stratocumulus clouds using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) based on observed cases with Lagrangian microphysics.  Lagrangian particle-based methods employ particles that are representative of a multiplicity of millions to billions of identical hydrometeors, which get around problems introduced in traditional bulk and bin microphysics schemes.  The project will focus on four primary potential sources of microphysical variability resulting in rain: condensation, stochastic collisions, turbulence-enhanced collision kernels, and giant aerosol particles.  The results of the simulations and comparison with observations will then be used to train the Bayesian Observationally-constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS), with the introduction of a stochastic component.  Simulations will be run in a purely non-stochastic mode and a fully stochastic mode to address the hypothesis that the non-stochastic BOSS will not be able to simulate the spatial variability whereas the stochastic BOSS will.  Further simulations will address the importance of the identified microphysical variability as well as whether BOSS can be run in a single-category mode with increased predictability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of major physical and emotional change, often bringing higher levels of stress that can lead to serious health problems such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and developmental delays in children. Currently, stress is usually measured through surveys or conversations with healthcare providers, which rely on self-reporting and may miss early warning signs. To address this need, the solution provides a simple wearable device that continuously monitors key health signals such as heart rate, sleep, movement, and skin responses. The device connects to a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data and provide real-time insights, alerts, and personalized recommendations to both the user and their care team. Approximately one in five women in the United States experiences mental health challenges during or after pregnancy, and maternal mortality has more than doubled in the past two decades?often due to stress-related cardiovascular and mental health conditions. By enabling earlier detection and targeted support, this solution helps users manage their health more effectively, improves outcomes for mothers and infants, and reduces costly complications for healthcare systems and employers.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a wearable device integrated with a suite of advanced physiological sensors, including continuous glucose monitors, blood pressure cuffs, electrodermal activity sensors, photoplethysmography sensors for heart rate variability, accelerometers for physical activity tracking, and sleep monitors. The device is designed to capture a broad range of biometric data, enabling the creation of a comprehensive stress profile. Artificial intelligence algorithms analyze these multimodal data streams in real-time, offering predictive insights and personalized, actionable recommendations regarding stress levels. For instance, activity readings detect acute stress responses, while heart rate variability patterns provide early indicators of chronic stress. These physiological metrics are contextualized with data on health-related social needs?such as access to care, financial strain, and work-life demands?to deliver a holistic, individualized view of maternal well-being. The broader societal and commercial impact includes addressing the rising rates of cardiometabolic and mental health-related maternal morbidity and mortality. By adopting this technology, users gain earlier awareness of their health risks, personalized strategies to manage stress, and better connections to resources, empowering them to improve their overall health outcomes during pregnancy and postpartum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aligns with those goals through the support of an early career scholar in the study of one of the most common pathogens affecting human health. Microbes rarely live in isolation; instead, they typically interact with one another to form complex microbial communities that can profoundly influence both natural and industrial ecosystems. One common and highly effective way these microorganisms cooperate is through the formation of biofilms, structured, multicellular communities that offer protection and enhance the community?s ability to survive environmental stresses and function collectively. In recent work, it was observed that the fungus Candida albicans is capable of interacting with strict anaerobic bacterial species, such as Clostridium perfringens, to form free-floating microbial aggregates called ?mini- biofilms.? Remarkably, these mini-biofilms form under aerobic conditions, and provide a protective niche for the anaerobic bacteria. With support from the CREST-PRP, this project will study these processes to gain a mechanistic understanding of how mini-biofilms are formed and regulated to provide valuable insight into the ways microbial communities coordinate, adapt, and persist in diverse environments. This information could inform new strategies for controlling microbial populations in environmental, industrial, and clinical contexts, thus contributing to national security and global competitiveness. The award will provide support for a postdoctoral scholar who will perform the research and engage in professional development experiences to strengthen the PI's preparation as a scientist, thereby addressing agency priorities to develop the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Biological phenomena such as biofilm formation are often controlled by transcriptional networks, where transcription factors (TFs) regulate subsets of genes involved in complex biological processes. To uncover the transcriptional network governing mini-biofilm formation, the genome-wide binding profiles of 52 TFs that are identified to be putatively involved in mini-biofilm formation will be mapped. Integrating this binding data with existing transcriptional profiling data will reveal the complete transcriptional network governing mini-biofilm formation. Next, the top 30 downstream target genes of the core TFs will be studied to understand which genes play key functional roles in mini-biofilm formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, they do not always provide high quality of experience. Often, this is attributed to the network layer (e.g., congested link, packet loss); however, issues may also lie in the lower fiber optic communications layer.  Optical fibers carry information with high signal quality and reliability; yet, at long distances, signal quality may degrade due to various phenomena, including fiber/amplifier aging, component anomalies, etc. To improve application performance and user experience, integrated end-to-end management is needed across the application, network, and physical (optical) layers. This approach can help network operators perform layer-specific root-cause analysis of the affected services, predict probable issues, and take preemptive actions to avoid poor service. This project addresses this critical need; it investigates cross-layer monitoring and analytics to correlate the effect of the optical layer on network-layer dynamics and vice-versa. <br/><br/><br/>This joint NSF-MeitY project will investigate machine-learning (ML) techniques for application-aware root-cause analysis and fault prediction.

It will implement routers for network-layer integration and monitoring agents at both optical and network layers.  Second, a cross-layer analytics platform will be developed to achieve holistic observability from application layer to optical layer. It will build a correlator to map the impact of failures in optical layer (by simulating controlled anomalies in the optical testbed) on the performance of different applications at the network layer. The cross-layer correlator will employ ML-assisted tools to explain the root cause of service degradation at network layer.  Finally, efficient strategies for preemptive application-aware fault remedy (such as re-routing of certain applications) will be developed. It will also study remedial actions at optical layer such as re-routing the affected lightpath, lighting up a new lightpath, etc.  Strong international collaboration between UC Davis, IIIT-Delhi, and IIT-Madras will bring expertise and shared knowledge for effective problem solving in related research areas and verify the research outcomes on the IIT-Madras testbed.  In summary, this project ? with its cross-layer monitoring and analytics framework ? will develop new insights in the discipline of reliable networking and contribute to the development of solutions for supporting robust future services. The project will provide excellent opportunity for training of graduate students, enhancing the educated workforce in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such actuators are important for food handling, wearable devices, surgical tools, and other applications requiring the safe manipulation of easily damaged items. The robotic factory can print an actuator from multiple polymer feedstocks covering a wide range of mechanical properties, in order to custom tailor the component to the needs of the user. Combining multiple materials to achieve a desired result is a challenging process even for human experts, made more difficult when producing novel parts for one-off tasks. Therefore the robotic factory embeds an intelligent design capability, using high-fidelity simulations to test and evolve millions of possible solutions. Even the best simulations depend on accurate knowledge of physical parameters. Therefore, after a part is manufactured, the robotic factory will test it against the simulator predictions. If the performance is acceptable, the part is used. Otherwise the simulator is recalibrated and the process repeats. With each cycle, the algorithm can explore an increasingly rich design space. To extend the number of iterations that can be performed without human intervention, failed parts are recycled and the material reused. The robotic factory draws on previous results to continually improve the parts it makes. Future generations of robotic factories will produce increasingly complex devices, up to and including fully functional soft robots.<br/><br/>This project seeks to transform the design and discovery of novel soft components and devices. The system, called EvoFab, is an autonomous robotic factory that combines innovative evolutionary algorithms with fully automated fabrication and in-situ characterization to design, manufacture, and test pneumatically powered soft components. EvoFab designs and simulates parts, which are then 3D printed, probed, and placed in a pneumatic test fixture, all without human intervention. Material from failed parts is recovered in an integrated recycling process. This collaborative project has five innovative threads: (1) a fabrication-aware evolutionary design system that rapidly and efficiently searches a design space for responsive configurations; (2) simulations of designs that minimize differences between numerical predictions and real behaviors; (3) an automated fabrication pipeline that prints and (4) characterizes those designs; and (5) an integrated recycling process that maximizes untended operation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This digital twin software, which provides a virtual online representation of a data center?s cooling system, offers significant advantages to the data center industry, by aiding in more energy efficient operations, longer equipment lifespan, and lower operational costs ? all of which are crucial in such a competitive and energy-intensive industry. The technology can also improve the reliability of services that use these data centers, benefiting government and commercial users as well as the general public by ensuring better, more consistent access to digital services and applications.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a modular simulation framework for analyzing and optimizing the thermal performance, energy efficiency, durability, and cost of electronic cooling networks. The framework integrates several scientific techniques into a unified workflow. A reduced-order thermal model is used to approximate three-dimensional temperature distributions across components, servers, racks, and rooms based on high-fidelity simulation data, enabling rapid assessment of new design configurations. This model is dynamically coupled with a flow solver that computes pressure, temperature, and mass flow rate across interconnected cooling components, including channels with phase-change behavior. The solver supports both single- and two-phase working fluids, making it applicable to traditional air and liquid cooling systems as well as more advanced boiling/evaporation-based techniques. Reliability prediction is incorporated using statistical degradation models and system-level availability metrics. The platform also includes cost estimation routines that compute key financial indicators, such as operational expenses, capital investment requirements, and investment returns, based on modeled performance. This integrated approach enables users to compare cooling strategies not only based on technical performance, but also in terms of long-term cost-effectiveness and system reliability, thus enabling more informed decision-making in the design of data center infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the traditional approach, environmental scientists collect field data and perform experiments at, for example, a particular river basin, and then repeat this process at a different time and/or location to see whether their conclusions generalize. This approach is rigorous, but limited because it is time-, labor-, and cost-intensive; thus there exists relatively sparse ground-collected data across the planet. Another challenge is that intensifying human activities amplify the rates of change in conditions per location and time, so knowledge discovered in the past will likely fail to predict outcomes in the future. The challenge of predicting and ameliorating the effects of environmental change disproportionately affects under-resourced communities, including those most vulnerable to environmental changes that lead to food insecurity and hence greater socioeconomic instability. Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches cannot resolve this challenge because they require extensive human input, for example due to the need for labeling ground-collected data or other data layers, such as high-resolution satellite imagery. In this project, on-the-ground human observations and labels are replaced with AI-based discovery from abundantly available, mostly unlabeled visual data, such as that collected from a combination of satellites and other devices. This research proposes a paradigm shift that enables low-cost scaling across many types of images in order to lower the barrier to access of this scientific process. In the process, a novel AI framework is introduced that combines multiple data sources to automatically discover interpretable scientific hypotheses about the cause of ecosystem changes. Together, these approaches will accelerate the ability to identify solutions for the increasing environmental issues faced across our planet.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and validate an  AI framework that can use a broad array of image data collected using different sensing modalities (e.g., low-resolution satellite, drone, and internet-posted images) to automate and accelerate the generation of interpretable environmental scientific hypotheses at a planetary scale. An example might be correlating the spatiotemporal prevalence of certain invasive or disease-causing species with presumed causal factors present in the environment. The proposed framework integrates new techniques into foundational models for satellite imagery that can choose intelligently among sparsely-labeled data from different sensor modalities, optimizing between cost and accuracy trade-offs. By coupling this model with self-improving large language models that can both receive and provide interpretable feedback and hypotheses to researchers, this approach goes beyond black-box feature learning, the current state-of-the-art in computer vision. This proposed model will be applied and validated on the task of detecting submerged aquatic vegetation. This task poses a number of technical challenges (e.g., waves, turbidity, weak spectral signal through water) that are more difficult than detecting objects on land surface. Success in this pilot project will demonstrate that this type of model can be easily applied to the terrestrial environment and to tackle even greater grand challenges in environmental science.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

POWDER?s existing radios and other equipment supports the spectrum sharing experiments and provides part of the RF sensing functionality needed by the RDZ. The project will design and develop a modular zone management system (ZMS) to manage, control and monitor all aspects of the RDZ. The project plans to conduct experiments on spectrum sharing with users outside of POWDER. Experiments potentially include RDZ shared access to federal, non-federal, and commercial spectrum, such as coarse- and fine-grained spectrum sharing with a commercial mobile operator and spectrum sharing with a weather radar.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the development of such data-informed solutions is still largely hampered by limited access to multisource, multi-resolution remote sensing imagery, leaving many in the machine learning and computational sciences communities unable to contribute robustly.  This project uses large language models (LLMs) to extract properties and relationships from relevant LA fire data sources, storing them in a comprehensive knowledge database.  By integrating complementary wildfire-related information, the framework facilitates monitoring of key physical parameters, such as real-time evacuation orders, meteorological variables, and air quality indicators.  <br/><br/>The project aims to develop an LA Fire Knowledge Graph-Agent (LAFireKG-Agent) platform--an autonomous and end-to-end LLM-based framework designed to meet the diverse data needs of end users, and enhance situational awareness for both safety and timeliness in wildfire risk management. The LAFireKG-Agent framework focuses on three key objectives: rapid decision-making, predictive modeling, and complex reasoning. Beyond these core capabilities, end-users, including computational scientists, environmental scientists, and risk managers, will be able to explore wildfire-specific questions, generate tailored insights, and receive data-driven recommendations. By integrating advanced machine learning and knowledge graph methodologies, this project will not only lead to more effective disaster preparedness and response strategies, but also promote open science and reproducible research in AI-driven environmental studies. The resulting tools and best practices will be shared through publicly accessible platforms, expanding research synergy among scientists, practitioners, and community organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That is the goal of this research, which merges advanced artificial intelligence methods with cutting-edge mathematics to transform biological and medical studies. By adapting large language models?the same type of technology behind today's most powerful artificial intelligence tools?to biomedical data, this project seeks to unlock critical insights into how cells function, how diseases progress, how the brain operates, and how best to treat a range of health conditions. The research will develop new artificial intelligence methods that track continuous changes in biological systems over time and space, build foundation models that can handle multiple types of data such as brain scans, heart tests, and clinical notes, and create specialized tools for gene expression data to better understand how cells and tissues interact. These approaches could lead to more accurate diagnoses, more efficient drug development, personalized treatments, and a deeper knowledge of both cellular and brain processes?bringing healthcare closer to being more precise, more effective, and more attuned to each individual's unique biology.<br/><br/><br/>This project develops a new class of computational frameworks that unify large language models with operator learning techniques to address key challenges in modeling spatiotemporal phenomena in biomedical research. Neural operator learning generalizes deep neural networks from functions to operators, enabling flexible modeling of high-dimensional and continuous dynamical systems governed by integral equations or partial differential equations. By combining these operator-based approaches with the ability of large language models to interpret and generate symbolic or tokenized representations, the proposed methods capture both local and non-local interactions, manage complex boundary conditions, and accommodate the wide variety of scales and data types inherent in biology and medicine. The research extends operator learning to handle continuous dynamical systems characterized by memory effects and long-range dependencies, develops strategies to unify varied biomedical modalities?such as magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram, and clinical metadata?in a text-based format, and builds new frameworks that transform genomic data into context-rich representations, enabling discovery of patterns in single-cell transcriptomics and multicellular interactions. These advances promise to significantly improve the predictive power and mechanistic interpretability of machine learning models in biomedical contexts, supporting breakthroughs in personalized medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These limitations are in stark contrast to human perception, which supports a comprehensive human understanding of social activities and efficiently establishes visual learning of novel scenes with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, this project calls for a paradigm shift via transforming machinery perception into embodied recognition to achieve performance guarantees in real-world applications. This is achieved by the proposed human-like visual understanding and efficient learning methods. These advances are expected to foster interdisciplinary applications, including enhanced human-robot collaboration, and benefit areas like disaster response, security, and healthcare. The outcomes will also contribute to education by integrating findings into curricula and engaging diverse student groups, thus promoting inclusivity and STEM education.  <br/><br/>The research seeks to establish algorithmic foundations for human-embodied visual understanding, mirroring that of human recognition. To accomplish this objective, this project proposes two thrusts: human-centered visual understanding and human-like visual learning. Through these two thrusts, the project will develop novel frameworks for understanding human behaviors and interactions and creating robust learning mechanisms from sparse data. These include: (1) a unified, end-to-end cross-modal framework for instance-level human parsing; (2) a multi-modal large-scale dataset dedicated to human non-verbal communication; and (3) a label-efficient learning strategy inspired by human cognition, enabling systems to recognize complex patterns from limited annotations.

Data scientists typically use dozens of libraries, but a single bug in any can destroy hours or even days of computation, causing significant pain. This issue has been widely discussed in the data science community and academic literature. Yet, no principled mechanisms have been proposed to address the issue which might be puzzling to database researchers because existing databases implement checkpointing to periodically save changes in data for future recovery. Why haven't data science systems adopted checkpointing? What are the unique properties of data science systems that challenge the adoption? This project will answer these questions and bring checkpointing to data science systems with zero modifications to existing libraries and programs. If successful, this project can enable checkpointing, for the first time, in today's data science ecosystems. It will enable recovery from crashes, execution ?undos?, suspending cloud resources without losing data, etc.<br/><br/>This project first identifies a critical challenge: data science systems lack mechanisms for detecting changes in data, an important premise of checkpointing. Existing databases achieve this with centralized buffer pools. In contrast, data science systems intentionally omit centralized data spaces, allowing individual libraries to manage data using shared memory, GPUs, and remote machines for high performance. The changes in these library-managed data must be identified for checkpointing. This project will achieve this identification by developing a nonintrusive state manager that can act like conventional buffer pools without forcing data to be placed in central places. The key idea is to build a mathematical map of library-managed data, including dependencies between data, using graphs. These graphs will enable new algorithms to identify changes, save them partially, and restore states correctly. This project will develop an open-source system, Kishu, to benefit all data practitioners. This project will also pursue its adoption into the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This in turn poses risks to online information exchange.  This project's goal is to model the risks that LLMs pose toward effective online discourse and develop tools to help information professionals assess LLM-generated online content.  Through studying a variety of professional roles that interact with many different kinds of content, the research will create generalizable models of information risks posed by LLMs, as well as methods and tools for creating community-specific guides for assessing and managing LLM content risks.  These tools, combined with planned educational and outreach activities, will help information professionals do more informed, effective work and benefit the roles and communities they serve.<br/><br/>The research plan starts with activities aimed at understanding the challenges that arise for information professionals with the increasing use of LLM-based content.

To support proactive planning, the researchers will develop threat modeling and red-teaming techniques that allow individual information professionals to assess the risks that arise in their own jobs and communities.  To support reactive detection, the team will create customizable, mixed-initiative intelligent tools for identifying potential risky LLM-generated content that are well-tuned to their particular context and epistemic practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of this task include tracking of animals for monitoring variability in species and pests in precision agriculture. Reliable automation of hierarchical classification has the potential to accelerate sustainability efforts and boost agricultural productivity. Machine learning is increasingly being used as an automation tool in ecology and agriculture. However, to fully realize the potential benefits of machine learning in hierarchical classification, principled methodologies are needed to ensure the trustworthiness and robustness of the models used in these applications. This research will develop methodologies for machine learning models to accurately report their uncertainty about predictions and to defer to human experts in a principled, resource-aware manner. Data scarcity and low-quality labels often hinder the effectiveness of machine learning systems. To address these challenges, this research will also develop theory and methodologies to overcome the constraints of scarce and low-quality data, both of which are common in hierarchical classification tasks in practice.<br/><br/>The project will develop isotonic regression methods tailored for uncertainty quantification in hierarchical classification. Moreover, it will design efficient algorithms for learning-to-defer in hierarchical classification. It will also develop hierarchical few-shot learning techniques to address data scarcity and robust algorithms for handling hierarchical label noise. Collectively, these efforts aim to establish principled methodologies that ensure the trustworthiness and robustness of hierarchical classification systems, enabling their effective use in mission-critical applications constrained by scarce, low-quality data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advancements in additive manufacturing have enabled the creation of these intricate geometries, leading to materials that excel in diverse applications, including safety gear, aerospace, noise-canceling technologies, and impact-resistant devices. Designing MMs today involves a complex, time-consuming iterative process where experts intuitively define designs, validate them with physics-based simulations, and refine them through trial and error.

By leveraging expert eye gaze as a privileged data source, the project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve model trustworthiness, and provide more interpretable and clinically relevant outputs. For example, understanding how a radiologist systematically examines a chest x-ray can help in designing algorithms that mimic this process, potentially improving the identification of subtle disease indicators that might be missed by less experienced readers or automated systems. By incorporating expert search patterns, ML models can become more accurate and reliable. The anticipated outcomes include improved clinical decision-making, augmented training for novice clinicians, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of advancing medical care and patient outcomes.<br/><br/>This project will develop foundational methods to characterize and integrate dynamic gaze patterns into machine learning pipelines. Algorithms will be designed to capture the spatiotemporal nature of clinical experts? visual search behaviors and their relationship to the spatial complexity of disease patterns in medical images. These gaze-informed models will leverage representations of scan paths to enhance both predictive performance and interpretability. Furthermore, gaze cues will be incorporated into multimodal models, enabling improved spatial and temporal coherence in tasks requiring image-text alignment, such as automated report generation. Evaluation of these methods will focus on challenging applications in radiology and histopathology, including cardiothoracic disease diagnosis, prostate cancer grading, and addressing class imbalance in long-tailed medical datasets. The project?s technical innovations aim to improve the predictive power of state-of-the-art deep learning models while introducing clinician-informed guidance, ensuring clinically trustworthy outputs.

These research aims will be complemented by an extensive evaluation plan, including systematic benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods and real-world validation across diverse unstructured environments. The findings will contribute to advancements in computer vision, robotics, and artificial intelligence while providing publicly available datasets and educational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To better understand and hopefully mitigate this loss, networks of ground-level sensors, satellites, drones, and community scientists are deployed to collect natural-world data at unprecedented scales. There is valuable scientific information stored in these raw data, the vast majority of which are as-yet inaccessible due to the time and resources needed to process the data by small groups of relevant human experts. Computer vision (CV) will prove crucial to facilitate efficient extraction of scientific insights from quickly growing repositories of natural world imagery, but in order to realize the goal of global-scale, near-real-time biodiversity monitoring we must develop computer vision approaches keyed to challenges encountered in real world settings. <br/><br/>This work formalizes and addresses cross-cutting limitations of current CV methods in the context of global-scale biodiversity monitoring, characterized in the following three research aims: (Aim 1) Robustly identify rare, visually similar, and even novel categories, all challenges separately for CV that co-occur in biodiversity data. We address this compounding challenge by augmenting limited training data and developing efficient active curation systems. (Aim 2) Adapt to new deployments and identify valuable data for specialized tasks. Biodiversity is non-uniformly distributed across the globe, and specialized models improve decision support. We introduce task-specific data selection as a specialization mechanism, and develop methods that adapt to new deployments over time while making optimal use of human effort. (Aim 3:) Share information and reason across modalities to fill data gaps and support scientific discovery. No single modality of biodiversity data captures the entire picture. We will develop data encoders that aggregate and share relevant information across modalities, and build on these encoders by developing interactive scientific AI agents that enable novel discoveries in data. These three research aims will be complemented by the development of cross-disciplinary educational programs that expand capacity at the intersection of CV and Ecology. Our proposed research innovations are necessary to enable robust, scalable CV deployments in ecological settings. Each aim outlined above will contribute towards our ability to deploy models with conservation partners and enable critical computer science/ecology collaborations. This combined effort will not only increase the utility of existing data and methods in the biodiversity domain, but will lead to advances in related application areas (including biology, astronomy, and neuroscience) as well as fundamental CV research challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the traditional approach, environmental scientists collect field data and perform experiments at, for example, a particular river basin, and then repeat this process at a different time and/or location to see whether their conclusions generalize. This approach is rigorous, but limited because it is time-, labor-, and cost-intensive; thus there exists relatively sparse ground-collected data across the planet. Another challenge is that intensifying human activities amplify the rates of change in conditions per location and time, so knowledge discovered in the past will likely fail to predict outcomes in the future. The challenge of predicting and ameliorating the effects of environmental change disproportionately affects under-resourced communities, including those most vulnerable to environmental changes that lead to food insecurity and hence greater socioeconomic instability. Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches cannot resolve this challenge because they require extensive human input, for example due to the need for labeling ground-collected data or other data layers, such as high-resolution satellite imagery. In this project, on-the-ground human observations and labels are replaced with AI-based discovery from abundantly available, mostly unlabeled visual data, such as that collected from a combination of satellites and other devices. This research proposes a paradigm shift that enables low-cost scaling across many types of images in order to lower the barrier to access of this scientific process. In the process, a novel AI framework is introduced that combines multiple data sources to automatically discover interpretable scientific hypotheses about the cause of ecosystem changes. Together, these approaches will accelerate the ability to identify solutions for the increasing environmental issues faced across our planet.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and validate an  AI framework that can use a broad array of image data collected using different sensing modalities (e.g., low-resolution satellite, drone, and internet-posted images) to automate and accelerate the generation of interpretable environmental scientific hypotheses at a planetary scale. An example might be correlating the spatiotemporal prevalence of certain invasive or disease-causing species with presumed causal factors present in the environment. The proposed framework integrates new techniques into foundational models for satellite imagery that can choose intelligently among sparsely-labeled data from different sensor modalities, optimizing between cost and accuracy trade-offs. By coupling this model with self-improving large language models that can both receive and provide interpretable feedback and hypotheses to researchers, this approach goes beyond black-box feature learning, the current state-of-the-art in computer vision. This proposed model will be applied and validated on the task of detecting submerged aquatic vegetation. This task poses a number of technical challenges (e.g., waves, turbidity, weak spectral signal through water) that are more difficult than detecting objects on land surface. Success in this pilot project will demonstrate that this type of model can be easily applied to the terrestrial environment and to tackle even greater grand challenges in environmental science.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future technological advances can reduce the burden, but not resolve the problems.  Technologists can improve the safety of their inventions by anticipating problems before they happen, during development, and even design to try to avoid them. The goal of this project is to build highly usable tools to provide technologists with the means to anticipate problems before they happen, during the design phase, to reduce the financial and social burden of errors. Different technologists use different types of tools, so the planned research will focus on tools for data scientists who build the algorithms that institutions use to aid decisions. These tools  impact the outcomes of millions of Americans on a daily basis, such as who gets  hired for a job. The result will be novel tools and guides that both practicing data scientists and data science educators need to anticipate and prevent unintended systemic errors in the real world. <br/><br/>Unanticipated systemic errors in real world automated decision-making systems often make it into real world systems because they are caused by implicit assumptions that the data scientists building the systems do not recognize. Additionally, data scientists' toolboxes are overflowing with often hard-to-use tools, delaying adoption of new safety enhancing tools.  The goal of this project is to reduce how many systemic errors make it into the real world. The first outcome of the project will be an understandable, highly reliable, AI assistant to help data scientists make more effective use of the many safety enhancing tools already available and new ones as they are invented. The second outcome will be conceptual tools that data scientists see the assumptions in their work. Throughout the project, the investigator will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the work via course-based research to increase the impact and ensure that the new tools are usable by future data scientists.

Because of this complexity, building accurate and timely models to predict and manage outbreaks in near real time is challenging and time consuming. It also requires copious data, which are often unavailable when it is urgently needed. To address these challenges, this project develops PanAX, a new computational system to improve how we prepare for and respond to evolving epidemics. The core idea is to use existing data and models in smarter ways and based on situational awareness, so we do not have to start from scratch every time. The focus is on identifying and leveraging the key underlying patterns and relationships that drive the spread of diseases, allowing models and data to be adapted to new situations more easily. Bringing together experts from computational and data sciences with epidemiologists,  PanAX explores the deeper causes of how epidemics spread in different contexts, helping to create models that are more adaptable, accurate and reliable based on real-time conditions. The project develops methods to reuse parts of existing data and models, applying them to new outbreaks in different locations or circumstances. Consequently, new tools will be created to better plan, inform, prepare the public, and respond to outbreaks. The project also trains students and researchers in advanced techniques in data and model driven response to epidemics, equipping them to tackle real-world challenges. In short, the aim of this project is to make epidemic response faster, more efficient, and more effective, using advanced data and machine learning technologies to benefit the society.<br/><br/><br/>Epidemics represent complex systems where the dynamics of disease spreading emerge from an interplay of time-dependent factors, including spatially distributed populations, mobility networks, and intervention policies. Modeling these systems accurately is challenging due to their multi-layered, causally interdependent structure and the lack of sufficient, high-quality data during critical early stages of an outbreak. The project develops an innovative framework, PanAX, that addresses these challenges by leveraging a data-driven, causally-informed approach to improve model reuse, generalization, and transferability across epidemic contexts. PanAX aims to disentangle and isolate domain-specific and domain-agnostic components from data and models, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and adaptive modeling. PanAX incorporates multi-layer, multi-scale causal relationships to better capture uncertainties in models derived from observational data and uses causality-based de-biasing techniques to eliminate statistical artifacts, enhancing model robustness and accuracy. It identifies transferable features and models between contexts, facilitating knowledge transfer from data-rich scenarios to emerging outbreaks with limited data. The framework focuses on scalable and effective spatio-temporal modeling, leveraging causal discovery and data management techniques to support counterfactual ""what-if"" analyses for outbreak preparedness and enhance prediction and intervention modeling by repurposing existing data and models. The project will deliver an open-source software system supporting researchers, public health officials, and policymakers in planning and managing epidemics. It aims to accelerate research, catalyze the development of innovative tools, and train the next generation of computer scientists to tackle cross-disciplinary challenges in causal learning, data integration, and computational epidemiology. By advancing the state of the art in causally-informed domain generalization and knowledge transfer, PanAX will transform how data and computer scientists contribute to epidemic science, offering scalable and generalizable solutions with real-world impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As top predators, leopard seals play a disproportionately large role in ecosystem functioning and act as sentinel species that can track habitat changes. How leopard seals respond to a warming environment depends on their adaptive capacity, that is a species? ability to cope with environmental change. However, leopard seals are one of the least studied apex predators on Earth, hindering our ability to predict how the species is responding to polar environmental changes. Investigating the adaptability of Antarctic biota in a changing system aligns with NSF?s Strategic Vision for Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research. This research, which is tightly integrated with educational and outreach activities, will increase diversity in STEM and Antarctic science by recruiting students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM and providing training, mentoring, and educational opportunities at an emerging Hispanic Serving Institution and a Historically Black Colleges and Universities campus. This project will improve STEM education and science literacy via museum collaborations, creation of informational videos and original artwork depicting the research.  The proposal supports data and sample reuse in polar research and long-term reuse of scientific data, thereby maximizing NSF?s investment in previous field research and reducing operational costs. <br/><br/>The researchers will investigate leopard seals adaptive capacity to the warming Southern Ocean by quantifying their ability to move (dispersal ability), adapt (genetic diversity), and change (plasticity). Aim 1 of the research will determine leopard seals? dispersal ability by assessing their distribution and movement patterns. Aim 2 will quantify genetic diversity by analyzing genetic variability and population structure and Aim 3 will examine phenotypic plasticity by evaluating changes in their ecological niche and physiological responses. The international, multidisciplinary team will analyze existing data (e.g., photographs, census data, life history data, tissue samples, body morphometrics) collected from leopard seals across the Southern Ocean over the last decade. Additionally, land- and ship-based field efforts will generate comparable data from unsampled regions in the Southern Ocean. The research project will analyze these historical and contemporary datasets to evaluate the adaptive capacity of leopard seals against the rapidly warming Southern Ocean. This research is significant because changes in the distribution, genetic diversity, and ecophysiology of leopard seals can dramatically restructure polar and subpolar communities. Further, the research will expand understanding of leopard seals? ecological role, likely characterizing the species as flexible polar and subpolar predators throughout the Southern Hemisphere. The findings of this research will be relevant for use in ecosystem-based management decisions?including the design of Marine Protected Areas? across three continents. This study will highlight intrinsic traits that determine species? adaptive capacity, as well as showcase the dynamic links between polar and subpolar ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional risk assessment approaches rely on the combined use of hazard models and likelihood of damage (i.e., fragility) models. By nature, both models make generalizations starting from the data utilized to develop them. However, extrapolation beyond available empirical data incurs large uncertainties and the chance of misestimating risk for extreme events. The progressive integration of high-performance computing architectures into civil engineering domains helps researchers to simulate all conceivable disaster scenarios. While this is creating extensive catalogs of data, a systematic methodology to extract and apply this knowledge to a cross-disciplinary framework, one that allows for continuous updates as more data become available, is missing. This research will attempt to lay the foundation for the next generation of data-informed probabilistic methods that can reliably assess infrastructure risks posed by extreme seismic loads, which are less understood but highly destructive.

More efficient separation and purification methods could reduce energy demands and costs of chemical production. Highly selective membranes can separate complex gas mixtures at low cost and high energy efficiency.  Zeolites are crystalline materials with arrays of pores that separate gas molecules based on their size, shape, and interactions with the pore walls. Zeolites are exceptionally well-suited for use as industrial gas separation membranes due to their excellent selectivity and chemical and thermal stability. Zeolite membranes have been commercialized for a few applications, but synthesizing thin zeolite films cost-effectively remains challenging, which limits their practical use. This project will develop a new type of zeolite membrane consisting of very thin sheets of a zeolite with pores small enough to perform difficult gas separations such as separating ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen. The project is an international collaboration between Johns Hopkins University, USA, and Ecole Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne, Switzerland. It will generate new fundamental knowledge necessary for innovation in the multi-billion-dollar global molecular separations market, increasing U.S. and Swiss economic competitiveness in critical industries. <br/><br/>This project will investigate a scalable approach for synthesizing selective zeolite membranes on porous supports. Specifically, zeolite nanosheets ? high-aspect-ratio two-dimensional (2D) zeolite crystals possessing pores with eight-member-ring (8-MR) apertures ? will be used as building blocks for preparing gas-selective membranes. Exfoliated zeolite nanosheets with the 8-MR pores orthogonal to the lateral dimension of the layer have not yet been synthesized. The project aims are to (i) synthesize highly crystalline, intergrowth-free, and high-aspect ratio 8-MR layers, (ii) exfoliate the 8-MR layers, (iii) deposit thin films on hollow fiber supports, and (iv) prepare graphene-supported nanometer-thick films. The study includes the development of novel zeolite nanosheet synthesis approaches combined with state-of-the-art thin film assembly, microstructural characterization, and membrane performance testing. This work will produce processing-structure-function relations for nanoporous thin film membranes. Fundamental knowledge will be gained about nanoporous materials synthesis, multiscale assembly at interfaces, and gas transport in complex microstructures.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These overflows often happen during heavy rainfall when sewer systems are overwhelmed and spill into streets and waterways. This research aims to address sewer overflows by using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict and prevent them. By combining real-time data from sensors with advanced AI models, the project will help cities manage their sewer systems more effectively and stop overflows before they happen. This approach can reduce cleanup costs and make sewer systems run more efficiently. Preventing sewer overflows also keeps harmful pollutants from reaching rivers and oceans, ensuring cleaner water for drinking and recreation. As urban areas continue to grow, upgrading sewer systems has become even more important. Through AI, this project helps cities respond to changing conditions and manage health risks. The results of this research will be shared with government agencies, utility companies, and researchers for managing sewer systems. These technologies will give engineers and city planners the tools they need to fix and upgrade sewer systems, lower the chances of overflows, and protect the environment.<br/><br/>Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) pose serious risks to both public health and the environment, requiring intelligent, data-driven solutions for effective prediction and mitigation. While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer transformative potential for optimizing sewer system operations, their practical deployment remains hindered by key technical barriers: insufficient guidance on the optimal spatial density and placement of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for capturing unsteady hydraulic behavior; limited methods for distinguishing between physical events and sensor-related anomalies; and a lack of comprehensive field-scale studies validating AI/ML applications in operational settings. The goal of this proposal is to develop an integrated AI-based optimization framework that unifies IoT sensing, physics-based hydraulic modeling, and scalable ML algorithms to support proactive, system-wide CSO management. The research is structured around three core objectives: (1) identifying sensor configurations that balance spatial coverage with cost-efficiency; (2) developing high-precision anomaly detection algorithms that isolate non-physical noise from genuine hydraulic events; and (3) empirically evaluating AI and ML performance in mitigating CSOs across diverse operational conditions. Field deployments in two urban sewer networks, enhanced by high-resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, will inform sensor deployment strategies and refine flow prediction models. AI-enhanced anomaly detection will improve data reliability, while ML models trained on heterogeneous datasets will enable accurate, real-time forecasts of CSO volumes and locations. Key deliverables include open-source, AI-physics hybrid modeling tools, advanced anomaly detection techniques, and a field-validated assessment of AI?s role in enhancing the resilience of urban wastewater infrastructure. Project outcomes will be disseminated through technical workshops and open-access digital platforms, fostering widespread adoption of AI-driven sewer management solutions and advancing the state of smart urban water systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will enable control over the thermal and kinetics mechanisms influencing the plasma-flame coupling. Research objectives include: i) experimental studies of plasma properties in a high-pressure cell using advanced laser-based diagnostics, such as laser scattering and optical emission spectroscopy; ii) development of a numerical model of the continuous optical discharge to elucidate the chemical kinetic pathways enhancing combustion; and iii) demonstrating the continuous optical discharge feasibility for combustion improvements in high-pressure environments.

Such EVs may be useful for drug delivery and for treating diseases. At present, it is difficult to manufacture high-quality EVs consistently. EVs produced in bioreactors vary greatly in size and composition. In medical applications, this variability makes it difficult to apply consistent EV dosages. This project will develop new biomanufacturing methods to manufacture EVs accurately, consistently, and in large quantities. This project will benefit society by making EVs a more reliable tool for disease treatment. Further benefit will result from training students in research, course development in biomanufacturing techniques, and outreach to pre-college students.<br/><br/>This project aims to solve two key problems related to EVs: scalable production and consistent characterization. To achieve this, a combined approach that integrates flow filtration and size focusing will be adopted. This research will utilize multiple complementary techniques to analyze EVs and establish critical links between key characteristics, such as EV concentration and protein content. These insights will enable the development of more precise and standardized dosing strategies for future medical applications. In addition, the biological effects of the optimized EVs will be elucidated using drug-resistant breast cancer cells as model systems. These functional tests will validate the effectiveness of our production process, and also confirm that the improved dosing strategy enhances therapeutic reliability. By addressing key bottlenecks in EV production and analysis, this project will significantly improve the ability to produce and measure EVs in a scalable and consistent way and advance the use of EVs in drug delivery and regenerative medicine. Beyond scientific advancements, this project will also support education and workforce development in biotechnology and biomanufacturing through training graduate and undergraduate students in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary research environment.

Aerosols have a larger impact on univariate extreme temperature and moisture events per unit global mean temperature change than greenhouse gases. However, their role in multivariate climate hazards is unknown and a framework on how to consider aerosols when attributing and planning for these hazards is also lacking. At the same time, aerosols are increasing because of increases in both anthropogenic and natural sources, accelerating the need to understand their role in climate hazards. This study addresses this need by 1) developing methodologies to uncover the influence of aerosols on multivariate climate extremes using state-of-the-art climate models; and 2) educating the next generation climate workforce with greater awareness of the factors contributing to multivariate climate extremes and the tools to enable robust societal planning for climate risk, taking into account these impacts.<br/><br/>A key hypothesis of this work is that aerosols can have a greater impact than greenhouse gases on temperature and moisture and, thus, multivariate climate hazards in certain regions and for specific events. The project will examine this hypothesis using existing and emerging model output from the multi-model single forcing large ensemble (SFLE) aerosol intercomparison project and the Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP). The SFLEs provide a decomposition for all pre-industrial through present day forcings into greenhouse gas-only forcing and anthropogenetic aerosol-only forcing, while one member additionally provides biomass burning (?black carbon?) aerosol-only forcing. The RAMIP, and a new black carbon-only forcing ensemble generated by this work, looks at how uncertainties associated with total aerosol emission, regional emission, and individual aerosol species impact near-term climate change. The project also develops novel aerosol-aware event attribution methodologies to better represent the impacts of aerosols on multivariate climate hazards both historically and in the future. To meet a growing need for a workforce trained in the computational and scientific theories specific to climate at the undergraduate level, this project integrates an undergraduate immersive, earth system modeling ?field trip? framework and experiential earth system modeling curriculum for climate system science undergraduates with the goal of building the quantitatively climate-literate workforce needed to allow cross-sectoral operational climate planning.

Although tools are available to measure circuits in the brain, it is still challenging to measure activity in the spinal cord. This project will develop new probes for studying the spinal cord that are small, flexible, and can study multiple regions of the spinal cord at the same time. Overall, the project will address how to engineer spinal cord probes that can be precisely positioned to target specific spinal neural circuits at different sites and depths. In addition to its scientific impact, this project will develop student talent in engineering.

EPiC will incorporate plant synthetic biology and bioprocess engineering. Three research challenges to be addressed. The first is engineering plant cell lines for improved bioproduction and downstream processing efficiency. The second is recycling plant biomass waste for use in subsequent cultures to improve sustainability and lower production costs. The third is identifying stable genomic loci for targeted insertion of expression cassettes. Three types of plant production platforms will be investigated.

Heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and arsenic (As) are often found in landfill leachate. These metals can cause severe environmental harm and create public health issues when they pollute surface or groundwater bodies. This project explores an innovative, nature-based solution using Vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides), a fast-growing plant with a demonstrated ability to absorb harmful contaminants from soil and water. Vetiver grass offers a low-cost, energy-efficient, and resilient approach to treating contaminated wastewater and landfill leachate while addressing critical environmental concerns related to PFAS and heavy metals. The project will address several unknowns to evaluate the performance of Vetiver grass, including Vetiver?s adaptability in highly toxic environment, adjusting its root and molecular structure to accumulate heavy metals and contaminants in it. A robust, data-driven framework that evaluates both the efficacy and sustainability of Vetiver-based phytoremediation systems will be developed. The integration of mechanistic and machine learning models will enable predictive capabilities, offering insights into site-specific applications and long-term management strategies. The scientific understanding of Vetiver?s phytoremediation capabilities and experimental results from this project will contribute to sustainable nature-based remediation practices that create alternative to chemical-based treatments. <br/><br/>This research aims to evaluate and optimize the performance of Vetiver grass in phytoremediation applications to remove PFAS and heavy metals from wastewater, leachate, and contaminated soils. The project addresses three fundamental scientific questions: (1) What is the absorption rate and storage capacity of Vetiver grass for heavy metals and PFAS in various environmental conditions? (2) How are these contaminants distributed between Vetiver?s roots and shoots post-uptake? (3) How do contaminant concentrations and climatic factors influence Vetiver?s phytoremediation efficiency? (4) What is the long-term fate of the contaminants uptake by Vetiver grass? Experiments will be conducted using hydroponic systems and soil media. The contaminant uptakes will be quantified through advanced analytical techniques, including Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Liquid Chromatography?Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/MS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The research will examine the influences of microbial interactions and soil type on Vetiver?s remediation capacity alongside the evapotranspiration studies for landfill applications. The project will synthesize data across varied conditions to develop predictive models for optimizing Vetiver-based phytoremediation systems. It is expected that this study will establish Vetiver grass as a viable, sustainable, and cost-effective means for PFAS and heavy metal remediation in different environmental contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To help address this challenge, solar energy can be harnessed to purify wastewater or seawater by evaporation and condensation.  A potentially efficient method for the evaporation step is to use solar-thermal interfacial evaporation, where solar heating and water evaporation occur together at the interface between air and water.  However, interfacial evaporators are usually made of bulk porous materials that introduce many limitations.  Recently, the team for this project developed a two-dimensional interfacial evaporator consisting of a metal surface containing microcapillaries.  Enhanced wicking in the microcapillaries and efficient light absorbance in the metal produced highly efficient evaporation.  This EAGER project will explore the mechanisms underlying the evaporator?s performance with the goal of producing optimal surfaces for high-efficiency interfacial water evaporation.  The project will provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in the research and will also sponsor open-house events for students to learn about technologies used in water research.<br/> <br/>Previous studies have shown that evaporation is strongly influenced by water clustering at the air-water and solid-water interfaces. To study the superwicking surface effects on water evaporation, two techniques will be applied - calorimetry and transient circular dichroism spectroscopy.  The experiments will test the hypothesis that the highly efficient evaporation achieved in the two-dimensional evaporator is attributed to a reduction in the enthalpy of vaporization in the device?s microcapillaries.  The outcomes will pave the way to design optimal surfaces for high-efficiency interfacial water evaporation and desalination, as well as to help understand other interfacial processes like corrosion, biofouling, bacterial growth, icing, boiling, and adsorption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional sensing approaches acquire data in a fixed fashion, independent of the task for which the data is being utilized. In addition, each of data acquisition, reconstruction and inference blocks in the data processing pipeline is independent of one another and optimized separately. This approach has led to exponential rates of data generation that creates an unbearable demand for power, storage, processing, and communication requirements in today?s sensing systems. The goal of this project is to advance the science of learning-based sensing and processing technologies by developing an adaptive, task-oriented and physics-aware data-to-decision pipeline, which jointly optimizes data acquisition, reconstruction, and inference stages in a data-driven learning framework. The proposed research will establish the foundations of future smart, adaptive, and resource-efficient sensing systems for a variety of applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, radar, and wireless communications.<br/><br/>This project has three interconnected objectives (i) Developing learning-based physics-aware multi-dimensional signal reconstruction techniques through foundational relations to regularized inverse problems and explainable architectures inspired from existing signal processing models, (ii) Developing mathematical and learning-based adaptive and task-oriented measurement design approaches with jointly optimized sensing, reconstruction and processing blocks, and demonstrate its impacts on real-world problems, (iii) Developing a learning-based data-to-decision framework, which infers actionable information (classification, parameter estimation) directly from low number of learned measurements. The central theme of planned synergistic educational and outreach activities is to increase the scientific literacy of both the K-12 and university students and the public regarding sensing systems, signal processing, and machine learning. Because sensing technologies are on the frontier of how information is perceived and extracted, and are essential to a wide range of applications, this project will have a high impact on sensing technologies being developed to improve the quality of our daily lives, ranging from applications of cameras to biomedical imaging, or from smart home technologies to autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased temperature due to greenhouse gases likely exacerbates the severity, frequency, and duration of hydrological extremes, such as droughts, flooding, and convective storms. Moreover, atmospheric aerosols from various sources also regulate precipitation intensity and efficiency via interactions with convective clouds and large-scale circulations, while those effects have not yet been fully accounted for in the present climate models. The overachieving scientific objective of this project is to advance the process-level understanding of anthropogenic aerosol on precipitation extremes. A series of critical science questions will be addressed in the project: to what extent extreme precipitation is sensitive to cloud and aerosol physics in a new-generation global weather/climate model; whether local precipitation extremes are linked to local and remote aerosol variations; what type of aerosol effect exerts larger impacts on convective precipitation. Results from the project will provide scientific evidence for policymakers to frame effective actions to address the potential flooding and drought issues in the future climate.<br/><br/>This five-year project plans to first improve the extreme precipitation simulation by enhancing the representations of aerosol and cloud microphysics in a fully compressible non-hydrostatic global climate model with regional refinement capability, Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), to convection-permitting scale. The complex impacts of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud and precipitation will be untangled under this modeling framework. The aerosol-aware MPAS will be evaluated against a suite of available ground-based and spaceborne observations. It will be further employed to assess the responses of crucial weather systems that regulate the variability of the water supply and the incidence of extreme precipitation events over East and South Asia as well as the western US, such as the Asian summer monsoons, the mid-latitude storms, and Atmospheric Rivers. The program will also train students through project-based learning by integrating extreme weather and air pollution research into graduate/undergraduate curricula.

One promising technology is based on a solid-state battery that uses lithium metal as the high energy storage anode. This battery design has potentially a very high energy storage density based upon the battery volume. However, a battery of this design may suffer from corrosion, which could cause short circuits, battery failure, and safety issues such as excessive heating. This project examines a new composite material, a metal-carbon mixed ionic-electronic conductor (c-MIEC), as a solution for overcoming corrosion issues.

The project will combine automatic in situ diagnosis technologies, machine-learning methodologies, and multiphysics modeling. This integrated approach will facilitate automated data acquisition, quantitative analysis, and process prediction of lithium metal plating and stripping behaviors under various interlayer lithiation pore-filling status. By quantifying the lithiation pore-filling process and elucidating its intricate correlations with the interlayer's physicochemical properties, the research will establish critical microstructure-property-function relationships necessary for optimizing efficient pore-free interlayers. Specific objectives include: (1) measure, analyze, and understand microstructural and chemical evolutions of interlayer during lithiation, (2) measure and understand electrochemical and mechanical evolutions of interlayer during lithiation, (3) integrate experimental findings into predictive modeling. By addressing key interfacial instabilities and advancing diagnostic methodologies, this project will enhance the performance and scalability of solid-state lithium metal batteries.

(PIMs) are unique materials that exhibit high internal surface areas and high rigidity, making them particularly promising for gas separations such as carbon capture and hydrocarbon purification. This project will develop design principles for making more robust and efficient gas separation membranes. These insights will come from investigating how PIM molecular structure and molecular motions can be used to avoid performance losses under industrial conditions. To bridge the skill gap needed for students to transition from academic to industrial research, this proposal will develop a new student safety certificate program at University of Florida to enhance student safety literacy and academic safety culture. New sustainability-focused, hands-on teaching kits and in-person and remote workshop activities will be developed for middle and high school teachers across Florida to incorporate in their classrooms. The combination of research, graduate and undergraduate training, safety education, and outreach activities will help train the next generation of STEM researchers.<br/><br/>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) are leading materials for energy efficient gas separation membranes but remain susceptible to a tradeoff between permeability and selectivity and detrimental effects of gas- and vapor-induced plasticization and physical aging. Despite observations that polymer dynamics play a crucial role in membrane gas separations, a lack of quantitative investigations of polymer dynamics alongside structure driven design has hindered advancement and commercialization of next-generation membranes. This project aims to experimentally decouple the effects of free volume and specific polymer dynamic modes on fundamental gas and vapor transport properties, plasticization, and physical aging in unique dipole-tagged PIM membranes. New, facile synthetic strategies to post-functionalize PIM-1 to prepare a library of well-controlled PIM derivatives will be developed to facilitate these studies. Experimental tools such as broadband dielectric spectroscopy that are relatively underutilized in the gas separation membrane field will be employed to quantify polymer dynamics. These structure/dynamics/property studies will address key hypotheses regarding how selective control over specific dynamic modes could improve gas permeability while maintaining selectivity and resistance to plasticization and aging. Tightly integrating modular synthetic strategies with multicomponent gas/vapor transport measurements and experimental polymer structure and dynamics characterization will provide transformative insights into how molecularly tailored PIM membranes can enable new improvements in chemical process efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, challenges like battery short circuits, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reactions limit the battery?s energy storage capacity and cycling stability. The research focuses on Zn aqueous batteries by addressing dendrite formation or short circuiting?a major barrier to their wide application. Insights gained from this work will enhance the performance and safety of Zn batteries, paving the way for their use in large-scale energy storage. The project integrates research with course development, promoting hands-on learning in energy storage technologies.

Many critical engineering challenges, such as trajectory design for space missions, occur within chaotic regimes where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. Traditional approaches often reduce these systems to oversimplified, low-dimensional representations that obscure their full complexity, leading to inefficiencies and blind spots in design. To address these challenges, this project seeks to answer two research questions ? 1) how can expanding the dimensionality of the problem space, while incorporating topological methods from knot theory, enhance the analysis, visualization, and design of complex chaotic systems to reveal previously unattainable solutions? 2) how does knot theory-informed reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop interactions enhance design quality, guidance, and decision efficiency and accuracy? This project hypothesizes that by expanding the dimensionality of the design space and integrating human-in-the-loop learning with mathematical insights from knot theory, it is possible to reveal new solutions and guide users toward more efficient, accurate, and interpretable design decisions. This work seeks to offer a new lens for understanding chaos, one that integrates visual, mathematical, and symbolic reasoning, while also engaging broader audiences in science and engineering through immersive learning tools and curriculum. Outreach efforts will include curriculum development and hands-on activities for all K-12 students to support engagement with advanced STEM concepts.<br/><br/>The research will pursue the two key questions through a multi-pronged investigation that merges topological dynamics, human-centered learning, and engineering design theory. First, the project will explore how universal templates from knot theory can be used to represent the qualitative structure of chaotic flows in four or more dimensions, enabling novel insights into the organization of phase space. The research will focus on identifying patterns and structures that organize chaotic motion, using knot theory as a mathematical framework to symbolically classify and interpret complex behaviors. These classifications will then support the development of new methods for exploring and navigating chaotic design spaces. As the system?s complexity scales beyond three dimensions, the project will explore methods for projecting and visualizing this behavior through dimensionality reduction techniques, enabling interpretation of 5D+ datasets (3D position, 3D velocity, divergence measure) while preserving topological integrity, enabling semi-analytical identification of stability boundaries and transition surfaces within high-dimensional phase space. Augmented reality (AR) will serve as an interactive research environment for exploring, testing, and refining mathematical hypotheses about chaotic structure. An investigation will be carried out on how symbolic insights from chaos theory can inform early-stage meta-reinforcement learning approaches for human-in-the-loop design, providing a conceptual basis for adaptive decision-making.

If unchecked, fibrosis can disrupt organ function. How specific cells within tissues contribute to fibrosis in certain organs is unknown, which makes it difficult to develop targeted treatments. This project will develop in vitro models to study fibrosis in the pancreas, skin, and uterine fibroids. The pancreatic fibrosis model will study how tissue stiffness, which increases during fibrosis, encourages or prevents cells from participating in fibrosis. The skin model will study how tissue stiffness and stretching influence how cells communicate across skin layers during fibrosis. The uterine fibroid model will examine how hormones and hormone disruptors impact fibroid cell growth. The outcomes of this work will expand knowledge of how cells behave in fibrosis in different organs and how certain cells can be targeted to develop therapies in the future.

This CAREER project aims to engineer many in vitro fibrosis models?pancreas, skin, and uterine fibroids?that designed to enable control over tissue-specific ECM features (stiffness, microstructure), cellular composition, and/or exogenous biochemical interactions for targeted investigation into fibrotic processes. The pancreatic model uses ECM materials with tunable stiffness?methacrylated type I collagen and hyaluronic acid?to study how stiffness and ECM remodeling direct, protect, or hinder cell fate transformations of fibrogenic (pancreatic stellate cells, macrophages) and non-fibrogenic cells (pancreatic epithelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells). The skin fibrosis model recreates skin?s layered structure to independently alter cellular composition and ECM properties (stiffness, alignment, microstructure) and examine cellular crosstalk across skin layers. A  novel intramural uterine fibroid model is used to investigate biochemical interactions?sex hormones and endocrine disrupting agents?as drivers of fibrosis that influence fibroid cell growth, ECM deposition, and lymphatic vascular infiltration. Overall, this project uses distinct, yet complementary, approaches to advance in vitro fibrosis models and lower barriers to resolving fibrosis at a cellular level.

The wake from a wind plant can extend miles downstream of the plant, which means that it may affect the efficiency of a downstream plant within the wake.  Most research regarding wakes from wind turbines has focused on the effects from a single turbine.  Results from this research has been used to optimize the design and performance of a wind plant.   However, interactions between neighboring plants have not been studied extensively.  This project will use a combination of experiments and numerical analysis to develop relationships between wind farms under conditions when one wind plant affects downstream ones.  The models will be implemented to current wind farm engineering flow-tools, which will increase their accuracy and efficiency, and contribute to more accurate planning of wind farms. <br/><br/>The proposed research will investigate the issue of successive wind farm wake interactions and develop reduced-order model representations for use by industry and national laboratories. Specifically, the research will quantify and develop models for (i) the production and recovery of momentum deficit that a single wind farm generates at its downstream outflow, and (ii) this outflow interaction with downstream farms.  Detailed large- and small-scale laboratory experiments and high-fidelity numerical simulations will be used to consider a multitude of real-world conditions, including changes in ground surface roughness, the Coriolis force, thermal stratification, global blockage and entrainment between the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the wind farm wakes.

However, understanding their fracture behavior remains a fundamental challenge due to nonlinear deformation and strain localization near crack tips. Current experimental techniques, such as methods based on full-field deformation measurements, provide valuable data but lack the resolution needed to capture localized damage. Additionally, existing computational tools to model fracture fail to efficiently integrate these full-field deformation measurements, leading to predictive inaccuracies. This award supports fundamental research that looks to overcome these limitations by developing an integrated experimental and computational framework for analyzing soft material fracture behavior. The outcomes of this research seek to advance the design of more reliable soft materials, enhancing the durability of medical implants, the resilience of soft robotic components, and the efficiency of energy-absorbing materials. Furthermore, the project looks to contribute to workforce development by integrating research findings into engineering courses, engaging students in interdisciplinary research, and supporting outreach programs to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The objective of this award is to understand and model soft material fracture mechanics from full-field deformation measurements by resolving crack-tip inaccuracies. This research will develop high-resolution experimental methods for tracking crack propagation using improved digital image correlation and digital volume correlation techniques, combined with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. These measurements will be used to inversely calibrate phase-field fracture models, enabling precise calibration of material parameters such as stiffness and fracture toughness. The approach will also include development of an automated constitutive modeling framework based on physics-augmented machine learning to refine phenomenological models and minimize model form errors introduced by manual model selection. The modeling scheme will be validated through experiments on brittle hydrogels, demonstrating the effectiveness in capturing complex fracture behavior. By combining experimental and computational approaches, this effort looks to provide a robust framework for soft material fracture analysis, thereby establishing a foundation for future advancements in soft materials and their uses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key reason lies in the brain?s ability to learn abstract concepts and their relationships, and to construct internal models of the world--rather than simply memorizing and retrieving patterns from massive datasets. This project aims to investigate the computational mechanisms underlying a recently discovered neural process in the brain: the ability of neurons in the early visual cortex to rapidly form local recurrent circuits, enabling them to quickly encode relationships between concepts. Although these neurons primarily act as local feature detectors, they can dynamically adjust their responses based on global context through these recurrent connections. However, the computational rationale behind this mechanism remains poorly understood.<br/><br/>The project seeks to develop a machine learning framework to formalize this rapid recurrent plasticity. The central hypothesis is that these recurrent circuits do more than encode global context as attractors--they also perform manifold transformations that bring semantically related concepts closer together in the neural activity latent space for encoding dependency among concepts, while compressing irrelevant dimensions of variation. The investigator will test this theory in tasks such as associative learning, de-noising, and pattern completion, combining computational modeling with neurophysiological experiments. The project will evaluate the predictive power, limitations, and practical utility of these biologically grounded models in real-world computer vision applications. This research will offer a new conceptual framework for understanding cortical recurrent circuits and pave the way for a new generation of biologically inspired AI systems--systems that are more efficient, generalizable, and aligned with the flexible intelligence of the brain, with broad potential impact on neuroscience, technology, and national security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical properties, including elastic, electrical, deformation, chemical, and thermal properties, are vastly different in melts when compared to solids of the same composition.  The melting behavior of minerals is therefore necessary to understanding the evolution of planets including the Earth throughout time and space.  However, measurements of high-pressure melting curves often differ by several 100s to 1000s of degrees.  To understand and correct divergent melting temperatures, the absorption of relevant planetary materials will be measured and used to improve melting curves by considering optical properties in temperature determination.  This project will develop an open-source, user-friendly toolkit and database for the high-pressure community to use in correcting temperature measurements to address a major source of discrepant values.  This project will support a postdoctoral researcher and several undergraduate students, who will gain the skills and knowledge to further our understanding of the Earth.<br/><br/>The proposed project combines a theoretical framework which considers wavelength-dependent absorption of samples and its effect on thermal emission as well as measurements of relevant planetary materials? optical properties at extreme conditions.  A graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit incorporating wavelength-dependent absorption, temperature gradients, and sample geometry will be developed and a database assembled to reconcile the spread in existing melting curves and allow for temperature correction of samples for more accurate measurements in future laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC) experiments.  This project will influence other branches of geoscience including geodynamics, seismology, and geochemistry and improve our understanding of Earth?s deep interior and the formation and evolution of the planet. The GUI toolkit will provide the mineral physics community with a free, open-source, user-friendly code that can be used by groups that measure temperatures by thermal radiation.  The proposed methods of temperature correction will help the mineral physics community resolve long-standing temperature discrepancies between studies and allow for a better determination of melting temperatures.  Knowing the melting temperature more accurately will better constrain properties that are temperature dependent such as element partitioning and rheology.  This research will also impact the materials science community in the understanding of how wavelength-dependent absorption affects temperature measurements more generally.  As wavelength-dependent absorption and emission are ubiquitous in Earth materials but mostly ignored, the toolkit proposed to correct temperatures will be used to improve existing data sets as well as future measurements.

These problems have many basic sub-computations in common, which this project will accelerate. The investigators will identify new ways to perform these sub-computations that are more efficient and will conceive new computing hardware that can execute them faster. Our society will benefit because this work will enable solving bigger versions of these problems faster and with less energy consumption. In addition, the project includes an education program that will teach computer science to high-school, college undergraduate and graduate students, with an emphasis on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. <br/><br/>The challenges of the graph problems considered stem from both the complexity of the algorithms used and the large compute and storage requirements of many graph problems. To address these challenges, this projects pursues an ambitious, cross-layer effort based on three interdependent main thrusts: new algorithms for graph problems, a core software framework for the efficient execution of these problems, and heterogeneous hardware to provide acceleration to these problems. The first thrust focuses on a few high-payoff algorithmic directions for the application domains considered: graph clustering in both static and dynamic settings; graph construction while preserving important information; and the application of machine learning (ML) techniques. In all these directions, the project uses approximations. In the second thrust, we develop a flexible programming layer that generates efficient code for a datacenter-scale platform. The project introduces a graph programming framework with a novel Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for graphs, high-performance numerical libraries for graph processing with scalable sparse methods, and a smart compiler with two intermediate representations that uses machine learning (ML) techniques. In the third thrust, the project speeds up the execution of graph applications in a large, distributed machine with a novel hardware accelerator. The accelerator features a high-level Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with instructions that perform sparse matrix operations on tiles. A smart auto-tuner software helps generate and map code to various accelerators and general-purpose engines.

However, despite their environmental and engineering importance, the influence of clay on flow behavior remains poorly understood. This award will explore how clay interacts with fluid motion across a range of real-world conditions by studying how these flows behave under controlled high-frequency oscillations. Laponite, a synthetic clay that forms a transparent suspension in water, will be used to enable researchers to observe and measure particle motion and turbulence development using advanced optical techniques. The project will lead to new models for predicting sediment transport, erosion, and flow stability in both natural systems and industrial settings. The findings can improve flood risk assessments, water quality monitoring, and the design of hydraulic structures. The award will also support hands-on learning for students in engineering and environmental science, encouraging interest in research careers and helping train the next generation of scientists and engineers in fluid dynamics and sustainability. <br/><br/>This award focuses on the fundamental physics of clay-laden flows subjected to transitional flow conditions, where turbulence develops under intense, time-dependent shear driven by high-frequency, small-amplitude oscillations. The project aims to systematically quantify how clay concentration alters the onset, structure, and evolution of turbulence in such flows. Using a custom-designed laboratory flume, the study will explore three primary regimes: (1) the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as a function of clay concentration and oscillatory shear, (2) the development and scaling of boundary layers over smooth surfaces, and (3) the influence of organized and random roughness on turbulence modulation in clay-laden boundary layers. Experimental results will be used to derive functional relationships linking turbulence characteristics to key control parameters: clay concentration, shear frequency, amplitude, and surface roughness. Emphasis is placed on identifying instability mechanisms, characterizing coherent structures, and quantifying energy redistribution across flow scales and regimes. These findings will inform predictive scaling laws for transitional clay flows and support models of sediment transport and boundary-layer behavior in engineered and natural systems. By bridging fundamental fluid mechanics with environmental and engineering relevance, this award will offer critical insights applicable to natural sediment-laden flows, infrastructure resilience, slurry transport systems, and water quality management across multiple scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Detecting and analyzing label-free small molecules under physiological conditions is even more challenging. This project will develop new sensing mechanisms and approaches for a nanopore sensor. The new sensor will be ultrasensitive and selective for various small molecules.  It will be portable, inexpensive, easy to use, and applicable to a variety of areas such as protein analysis, pharmaceutical research, clinical molecular diagnostics, environment protection and preservation, and national defense and bioterrorism prevention. The knowledge and methods obtained from this project will benefit molecular biophysics and biochemistry, single-entity electrochemistry techniques and other stochastic sensors.

Glass nanopipettes, as a subtype of solid-state nanopore, have become increasingly popular due to their versatility, easy accessibility, and simple and cheap fabrication, but they are severely limited by their poor size resolution for the detection of small molecules. This project aims to use nanopipettes to develop a self-crowding and ligand-binding assisted ultrasensitive label-free electrical detection method for small biomolecules and bioactive small molecules at the single molecule level under physiological conditions based on their size, structure, charge, mobility and affinity. The project has two research tasks: (1) Understanding the unique ionic signals induced by self-crowding at the nanopipette tip and (2) Developing a small molecule sensing approach based on ligand binding. The proposed approach has the potential to solve the major challenges in nanopore sensing by slowing down the small molecules in the nanopipette sensing zone through self-crowding. The accumulation of small charged molecules in a confined nanoscale space also induces new nanofluidic phenomena, leading to new sensing mechanisms other than the volume exclusion mechanism (or Coulter Counter principle). The tunable crowding at the nanopipette tip and the enabled high sensitivity and structure resolution for molecular complexes also provide exciting opportunities to study the stoichiometry, binding strength and dynamics of small molecule involved interactions in a crowded environment at physiological conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Abnormal metabolic changes can lead to diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart conditions. Detecting metabolites in living systems in real-time is crucial, but conventional methods require obtaining and destroying samples, which means they can't be used to measure metabolites in individual cells. This project addresses the gap by developing fluorescent probes for highly sensitive and selective detection of key metabolites within living cells. These probes will enhance research in human health, nutrition, plant science, food safety, and environmental studies. Additionally, the project will support interdisciplinary scientist training and engage middle school students through workshops and lab tours.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this project is to develop genetically encodable RNA-based fluorescent probes for metabolic imaging and profiling in living cells. These probes comprise three modular domains: a target-binding riboswitch, a fluorogenic RNA reporter, and a transducer. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers can selectively bind and activate the cellular fluorescence of chemical dyes. Riboswitches are natural metabolite-sensing RNA regulatory elements. About 60 distinct classes of riboswitches have been identified so far, covering a wide spectrum of important nucleotides, amino acids, ions, enzyme cofactors, signaling molecules, etc. Upon binding target metabolites, riboswitches can undergo rapid conformational change. The transducer here can be a simple RNA duplex or structural switching RNA sequence that will convert the conformational change of riboswitches into the activation of fluorogenic RNA signals. The major objectives are: (1) to engineer modular allosteric fluorogenic RNA ?Broccoli?-based metabolite sensors with a duplex transducer and many-to-most existing class of riboswitches; (2) to develop a new in silico platform to further improve the throughput of probe design and their sensitivities; and (3) to obtain quantitative, multi-colored, and time-resolved imaging profiles of diverse metabolites in individual living bacterial and mammalian cells<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emissions of soot, a byproduct of combustion, have detrimental effects on air quality and human health.  Models that accurately describe soot formation could be helpful in designing and optimizing the next generation of combustion devices to reduce soot emission. However, experimental data for soot formation are needed to develop and validate soot formation models, and such data are scarce. This project focuses on the inception of soot formation.  Despite many years of research on soot, inception is not well understood.   This project involves a series of experiments designed to uncover the necessary information about soot formation for use in soot models.  Although the focus of the project is on soot, the underlying inception process is similar to the formation of carbonaceous dust in the interstellar medium and the synthesis of nanocarbon material in industrial applications.  Thus, improvements in modeling generated by this project may have broad applications.<br/><br/>The proposed project integrates research and education to build toward mitigating the environmental impact of energy conversions and usages, by unraveling the soot inception kinetics. The research objective is to quantify the electrically neutral and charged flame products including small molecules resulting from fuel oxidative pyrolysis, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), weakly bonded molecular clusters, and soot nuclei. Measurements will be performed in several carbon-rich laminar premix flames with different reactant compositions and maximum temperatures. The flame products will be measured directly or after making them collide with other neutral and charged species purposely seeded either in the sampled flow or directly in the flame. The results are expected to clarify the invariably neglected effect of the electric charge on the clustering of PAHs, by characterizing the kinetics of collision charging and condensation growth occurring in the flames and post-sampling. The research efforts are complemented by an educational plan with three objectives: 1) sensitizing the public on technical aspects affecting the sustainable satisfaction of the global energy demand;  2) inspiring K-12 students to undertake college education in STEM, and 3) equipping undergraduate and graduate students with engineering skills to study reactive multiphase flows relevant to the energy sector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LMs have significantly advanced deep learning, reshaping the modeling and resolution of predictive tasks, yet in the real world, their deployment often results in errors. This undermines trust in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and necessitates the development of advanced AI algorithms that address the unique complexities and emergent capabilities of LMs. New research underscores the inherent relation between uncertainty and various responsible AI principles, highlighting the critical role of uncertainty estimation in ensuring reliable decision-making, especially in sectors like healthcare and autonomous driving. This project will explore uncertainty's decisive yet largely unrecognized role in enhancing LM reliability. Considering the unique characteristics of LMs that present new opportunities and challenges beyond the scope of traditional uncertainty estimation methods, this project uses conformal prediction, which uses past experience to help determine confidence in new predictions.  It leverages conformal prediction?s advantageous features like lightweight design, rigorous approach, and informative output. It  further integrates these qualities with the emergent properties of LMs to enhance their performance and reliability. The successful outcome of the project will expand the fundamental understanding of responsible LMs, enable effective LM-augmented tools, and advance conformal prediction research to a new frontier, thus positively impacting the overall value of various large-scale data and foundation models and responsible AI education.<br/><br/>This project is structured around three interconnected research aims. The first aim quantifies uncertainty for LMs with theoretical guarantee, exploring conformal prediction across different LM settings, including closed-source, open-source LMs, and scenarios challenging the fundamental exchangeability assumption in conformal prediction. It will then demonstrate how conformal prediction can be applied to detect and mitigate hallucinations to improve LM reliability. The second aim focuses on merging conformal prediction's robust uncertainty estimation with LMs' self-correction capabilities, using reliable prediction sets to iteratively refine LMs and reduce uncertainty through conformal prediction-guided Chain-of-Thought reasoning and external knowledge integration. The third aim introduces an uncertainty-based reliability measures and develops processing error mitigation strategies that utilize conformal prediction to strategically enhance responsible AI in both closed and open-source LMs, ensuring more equitable outcomes across a range of application scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, evolutionary trees and networks are commonly used to study the evolution and genetic basis of traits, with applications in fields ranging from medicine to agriculture and conservation. Despite significant progress over the past decade, many important parts of evolutionary history remain unresolved or are subject to debate. An opportunity to address these open questions has recently emerged. Technological advances have led to more complete and high quality genome assemblies than was previously possible, even resolving highly repetitive regions, like the 30-50% of vertebrate genomes made up of retrotransposons--DNA sequences that when active can copy-paste themselves to new locations. This development is significant because retrotransposons are major drivers of genome expansion and innovation--and their presence or absence at related positions across the genomes of different species are powerful markers of evolution. However, new computational methods are needed that leverage retrotransposon data for species tree and network reconstruction, an emerging field called retrophylogenomics. Only a few methods have been developed to date, but they are based on simple models that do not reflect retrotransposon dynamics. This project will address such challenges, building the computational infrastructure needed for fast and accurate evolutionary analyses of retrotransposons. This research will be integrated with an education plan to provide hands-on research and training opportunities in interdisciplinary computing and data science for undergraduate and graduate students. The software tools and curated data sets from this project will be incorporated into outreach for middle and high school students, connecting computing fundamentals with scientific discovery.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to address the core algorithmic and statistical barriers to retrophylogenomics, an emerging field concerned with leveraging retrotransposons to understand the evolution of species and populations. This goal will be pursued through the following activities. (1) Development of fast and user-friendly data processing workflows for calling retrotransposon variants from whole genome alignments, alleviating the need for manual curation. (2) Development of realistic models of retrotransposon evolution, integrating knowledge of retrotransposon dynamics with evolutionary models acting on multiple scales from the species/population-level to the molecular level. (3) Data simulations and model validation. (4) Design and analysis of methods for inferring species trees and networks from retrotransposons, blending statistical techniques with discrete algorithms. (5) Implementation of methods in open-source software. (6) Evaluation of method accuracy and scalability on simulated and real data. (7) Application of methods to vertebrate genomes to generate the largest catalog of retrotransposons variants, along with reconstructed species trees or networks. Graduate students will fully participate and be mentored in these activities.

It has been difficult to study the health risk of this virus because it does not grow in the laboratory. A new method using 'human intestinal enteroids cells,' or HIEs, now allows norovirus to be grown in the laboratory. This research project will use HIEs to measure infectious norovirus in water. The study will investigate how this virus is removed by water treatments. Ultimately, this information will help ensure safe water and potentially facilitate reuse of treated wastewater. This project will also support outreach to a local Boy's and Girl's Club to give career day talks. The project will also develop water quality learning modules for high school students and engage the public in science education through public 'Science at Sunset' and 'Science Sundays' sessions.<br/><br/>Norovirus, a critical waterborne pathogen, is predicted to account for most infections from exposure to sewage-contaminated water. Understanding the fate of norovirus in the water environment is thus crucial for addressing pressing water management challenges, including wastewater reuse and ensuring recreational and agricultural water safety. Norovirus has historically been unculturable in the laboratory. Thus, current measurements of norovirus fate in water and wastewater treatment systems rely on molecular or surrogate methods with unknown agreement with infectious norovirus. Recent culture models based on HIEs have enabled the cultivation of norovirus. The project will use HIEs to characterize infectious norovirus fate in water and wastewater using controlled laboratory experiments and samples from full-scale systems. Examples of processes that will be evaluated include chlorine and ultraviolet disinfection, membrane treatment, and an activated sludge process. This research will also enable the assessment of the agreement of culture, molecular, and surrogate measures of infectious norovirus fate in water. Cultivation of norovirus in HIEs remains highly specialized; thus, validating molecular or surrogate approaches to understand norovirus fate would enable and support additional research in this critical arena using more accessible tools. Finally, HIE-cultured samples will be paired with metagenomic sequencing to develop a 'shotgun culturing' approach to identify the infectious virome from wastewater samples. Ultimately, this work will provide the most comprehensive evaluation of norovirus fate in water and wastewater treatment systems, informing water quality monitoring and design of wastewater reuse systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, building materials and furniture surfaces inside homes are sources, sinks, and temporary reservoirs for chemicals.  At the same time, microbes such as bacteria, viruses and fungi can grow on these surfaces.  Usually, researchers study the chemical factors and biological factors affecting air quality separately.  This project will investigate them in combination by exploring, for example, how chemical compositions on surfaces or in the surrounding air can trigger changes in the way microbes grow on various surfaces typically found in a home. By studying the chemical and biological factors together, the project will produce results that can inform air quality guidelines to improve indoor environmental quality.  The project will also introduce local middle school students to air quality issues by helping them build environmental sensors that will be deployed on campus to monitor environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This project will determine how perturbations to indoor surface chemical composition and indoor air pollutant distribution impact microbial gene expression and microbial volatile organic compound (mVOC) emissions, to better understand and mitigate the chemical and biological drivers of poor indoor air quality. Laboratory chamber experiments, volatile organic compound measurements, and microbial gene expression analysis will be performed to support the following research objectives: (1) Establish how building material surface composition influences microbial gene expression and emissions; and (2) Build networks to connect environmental pollutant exposures to microbial gene expression and emissions. This research will expand knowledge in indoor chemistry and microbiology by revealing how indoor surface and air composition influence indoor microbial communities, and vice-versa. The study will use RNA sequencing to connect microbial community metabolism with surface chemical composition and pollutant exposure in the built environment. Indoor environmental conditions, especially increased humidity in non-climate-controlled homes, could impact the chemical composition of indoor material surfaces and thus alter fluxes of chemicals between surfaces and air, as well as create favorable growth conditions for microbes.

The goal of this CAREER project is to improve the understanding of how two X chromosomes in female cells contribute to female-specific aortic valve stenosis progression, the most common aortic valve disorder that can lead to sudden heart failure. To accomplish the research objectives, sex-specific cell culture platforms will be engineered using hydrogels that mimic the soft tissue microenvironment of the aortic valve. These platforms will be used to investigate how X chromosome genes contribute to female-specific valve cell phenotypes. Using various biomaterial tools, female-specific genes on the X chromosome will be linked to increased aortic valve tissue stiffening in females. In parallel, the educational objectives focus on clarifying and communicating the importance of sex as a biological variable in biomedical research to undergraduate students, the UC San Diego community, and the public. Specifically, the importance of sex as a biological variable in biomedical research will be promoted though undergraduate senior design projects, campus-wide symposia, and public science communication events. <br/> <br/>Biological sex influences the progression of aortic valve stenosis (AVS), with males exhibiting increased valve calcification and females experiencing severe valve fibrosis prior to eventual calcification. The biological mechanisms underlying sex-dependent fibro-calcification of aortic valves remain poorly defined, partly due to significant challenges in disentangling the effects of sex hormones from those of sex chromosomes on sexually dimorphic VIC phenotypes in vivo. Existing in vitro strategies rely on cell culture substrates that fail to replicate the time-dependent dynamic changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) structures observed in health and disease. This CAREER project aims to engineer dynamic in vitro systems to investigate how X chromosome-linked genes modulate female-specific fibrosis during AVS, while isolating these effects from hormone biology. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs), the primary fibroblast population within aortic valve tissue, are believed to drive sex-specific differences in aortic valve fibro-calcification. In XX female VICs, X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a long non-coding RNA that silences one of the X chromosomes during X chromosome inactivation (XCI), is expressed. The central hypothesis of this work is that reduced XIST expression in VICs regulates dynamic ECM remodeling and fibrosis during aortic valve stenosis. To test this hypothesis, the research objectives will focus on engineering hydrogels as cell culture platforms using biorthogonal chemical conjugations to create culture systems that mimic the dynamic ECM. These hydrogels will allow for spatial and temporal evaluation of XIST expression dynamics independently of sex hormones. Collectively, this proposal seeks to establish fundamental knowledge regarding how XIST expression regulates ECM alterations during valve fibro-calcification, independent of sex hormone effects. Future efforts will explore the independent and synergistic roles of sex hormones and sex chromosomes to fully elucidate the mechanisms defining AVS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GPDs can shape departmental procedures, enact institutional policies, and disrupt power dynamics between faculty and students. In other words, GPDs are central to improving and sustaining graduate students? mental health and wellbeing. As such, this project will construct a curriculum with GPDs to aid in implementing trauma-informed practices to a large audience of GPDs. The project outcomes will support the improvement and development of proactive interventions to support positive mental health and wellbeing in graduate engineering programs. Improving the systems that support graduate student mental health in engineering programs will enhance recruitment and retention at all levels of engineering education, which in turn addresses the national need of training engineers to address grand challenges. The project results will also raise awareness of graduate mental health in engineering programs by preparing faculty in leadership positions to change the climate in graduate programs directly. These changes will serve as evidence-based models that increase the adoption of practices to support mental health and promote student wellbeing.<br/><br/>This project will examine the mental health crisis by focusing on the role of GPDs in integrating frameworks of care that consider the full range of traumas graduate students have experienced or could experience. The results of this investigation will characterize the roles of engineering GPDs and inform the development of methods to train a community of GPDs to implement evidence-based practices that foster care. This project will use a two-phase research design to address three research questions (RQ): RQ1: What are the characteristic roles of engineering graduate program directors in fostering cultures of care in their programs? RQ2: How do the systemic structures within higher education impact engineering graduate program directors? implementation of trauma-informed frameworks of care? RQ3: What professional development program features can support engineering graduate program directors? perceived ability to integrate trauma-informed frameworks of care in their approach to supporting graduate students?  Phase 1 will leverage sequential mixed methods through a national survey followed by semi-structured interviews to characterize the roles of engineering GPDs and how programs leverage care practices. Phase 2 will build on these characterizations to collaboratively develop an evidence-based professional development framework for creating trauma-informed systems of care within engineering graduate programs. We will integrate a group coaching professional development approach with collaborative inquiry to explore the lived experiences of the GPDs participating and enable their attempts to foster care in their programs. The research design will expand existing theories for implementing trauma-informed frameworks of care to promote positive mental health and wellbeing within engineering graduate education.

Follicles cannot be replenished, so the total number declines as some follicles are selected for growth every month.  The remaining follicles remain dormant to preserve reproductive function over several decades.  The mechanisms that determine which follicles are selected for growth and which remain dormant is poorly understood.  A better understanding of these mechanisms could inform new treatments for infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, cancer treatments, or aging. Studies suggest that changes in the stiffness of the follicle microenvironment may trigger follicle growth. The goal of this CAREER project is to investigate how dynamic stiffness influences follicle growth to interrogate this relationship. The project will use a new bioelectronic material that changes stiffness in response to an applied electric potential to modulate, study, and optimize mechanobiological functions of ovarian follicles.  The project will support grade 6-12 outreach activities and curricula in biomaterials engineering as well as undergraduate learning modules, all to support increased participation in STEM fields. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will investigate how dynamic stiffness of the microenvironment of ovarian follicles influences their growth characteristics. Extracellular matrix stiffness spatially varies in the ovaries and these different regions are associated with different follicle growth phenotypes. It is hypothesized that when follicles observe a decreased stiffness, cell signaling pathways are disrupted and dormant follicles are activated to a growing state. However, there are no material systems available that can present defined mechanical stimuli to follicles in a cytocompatible fashion. The goal of this proposal is to develop a biomaterial platform to investigate how microenvironment stiffness dynamics result in changes to follicle growth rates and the corresponding cell signaling pathways. Conducting polymers will be used to develop 3D bioelectronic scaffolds that change matrix stiffness in response to an applied electrical potential. The research objectives include (1) to define processing-property-function relationships of conducting polymers to optimize the stiffness range to match the ovarian microenvironment, (2) to determine cell signaling changes of ovarian cells in response to dynamic matrix stiffness in 2D culture, and (3) to determine if dynamic stiffness programs can control follicle growth rates using 3D printed microporous scaffolds.

The formation of the network, in turn, affects how the suspension flows through nozzles. This project will investigate the possibility of tuning the extent to which polymers stick to the particles, which will affect the number and shape of the polymer bridges and the flow properties of the suspension. This process represents a simple model of a variety of applications including fabrication of membranes for water purification, batteries for energy storage, and drug formulations to improve delivery.

Using a model colloid-polymer mixture with attractive bridging interactions that are tunable through solution pH as well as polymer concentration and molecular weight, the overarching hypothesis that flow-induced conformational changes in the polymers will also affect the extensional flow of colloid-polymer bridging mixtures will be examined. This will be done by (1) linking extensional response of bridging mixtures to polymer macromolecular properties; and (2) determining the effect of normal stresses on extensional flow of bridging mixtures. Optical microscopy experiments will be used to characterize the structure of quiescent mixtures. Data from shear and extensional flow experiments will be used to test models and elucidate the contributions of polymer elongation and particle-induced stresses to the rheological properties. This award will examine the extent to which properties such as the extensional relaxation time and filament lifetime are controlled by flow-driven changes in polymer conformation, which is expected to vary as polymers adsorb to the colloids.

This knowledge is expected to lead to rational design principles to generate complex fluids feedstocks for materials processing routes that involve extensional flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study the behavior of sessile drops when air flows past the surface. High-speed imaging shows that in this case sessile drops oscillate before they become dislodged from the surface. The reason for these surprising oscillations is not well understood. The experiments in this project will uncover the causes underlying the drop oscillations. This project will benefit many practical applications, including improving surface washing, reducing ice growth on aircraft, and improving heat transfer operations. This project will benefit society by improving energy efficiency and by training students in advanced experimental techniques. Outreach programs will be conducted to attract high school students to scientific careers. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the oscillatory dynamics of sessile droplets exposed to steady shear flow of the surrounding air, focusing on the interplay between drag forces, surface tension, and fluctuating pressure fields. The research addresses two fundamental questions: (1) how does the interaction between drag force and surface tension affect droplet oscillations, and (2) what is the role of the surrounding pressure field in modulating oscillation patterns. High-speed shadowgraphy will be used to capture the dynamics of droplets, while Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) will be used to reconstruct the surrounding velocity and pressure fields. Experiments will systematically vary surface tension and the velocity of the surrounding air to quantify the competing forces responsible for droplet deformation and oscillation. The analysis will combine force balances with image processing techniques to track droplet motion and scaling laws to interpret the results. By characterizing the inertial effects induced within the droplets, the project aims to provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing contact line depinning. Contact line depinning is the critical step to dislodging the droplet from the surface. The project will generate experimental data and insights to inform future predictive models describing the oscillation frequency and amplitude of the sessile drop. The outcomes will advance the fundamental understanding of droplet dynamics and will benefit applications involving droplets that dislodge from surfaces, such as advanced energy systems, heat exchangers, or anti-fog surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wastewater treatments that use membrane technology to separate pollutants generate concentrated waste streams that are rich in PFAS compounds and salts. This project will use short-wavelength UV light-driven water photolysis to destroy PFAS in the waste stream. Short-wavelength UV light is among the most efficient water ionization photon sources, because it uses water molecules as a catalyst. It can be readily generated and is safe to control and operate. This project will investigate pathways to produce an extremely reactive system to destroy PFAS at reduced energy cost.

Short-wavelength UV light takes advantage of water molecules as the catalyst. Elevated salinity in the brine can further catalyze the photolytic process and PFAS destruction. The research will test the hypothesis that short-wavelength UV water photolysis in the brine can produce an extremely high yield of hydrated electrons, and the brine solution chemical conditions (e.g., pH, chloride, sulfate and bromide) and light sources (wavelength and intensity) can be optimized to maximize PFAS degradation and minimize the energy footprint of UV-based treatment. The project will be carried out through a partnership between University of California, Riverside and the Orange County Water District (OCWD) that operates the world?s largest advanced water treatment system for potable reuse. The outcome of this project has the potential to help the water industry with smart infrastructure for sustainable PFAS water treatment technologies.

Individual plate movements can be determined if their past motions are compared to a fixed source on Earth, such as so-called ?mantle hotspots?. These hotspots are generated by mantle plumes, large thermo-chemical uprisings of material that originate on or near the core-mantle boundary. These upwellings of hot material can produce volcanism on Earth?s surface that remains relatively stationary while plates move over them, generating chains of compositionally distinct volcanoes that are progressively older the further they are from the hotspot. This work, through tracing ages, compositions, and morphologies of several poorly-documented volcanic chains, seeks to better understand the timing and drivers of global scale plate reorganization events that took place in the Mid-Cretaceous (120-80 Ma). The target locations include the Liliuokalani Ridge, Hess Rise and Mid-Pacific Mountains in the Central Pacific region. The team will be able to test whether the features were built by mantle plumes that are currently underlying the Northern French Polynesia region. The combined age and chemistry results will then be used to constrain the timing of a major plate reorganization event at ca. 100 Ma. This project supports three early-career scientists, two PhD, and one MSc student. In addition, the seagoing expedition will include eight undergraduate research participants from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and California State University, Long Beach.  <br/><br/><br/>The project involves a 31-day seagoing expedition to dredge seamounts, ridges and rises within and near Hess Rise and the Mid-Pacific Mountains. In addition, the team will analyze basalts recovered on NOAA-Ocean Exploration and Research expeditions from Karin Ridge and samples from an upcoming E/V Nautilus expedition to the Liliuokalani Seamounts. Onshore work will include obtaining 40Ar/39Ar age determinations and geochemical tracers (major and trace elements; Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes) from representative lava flows. These new samples and comprehensive datasets will allow for the testing of the following hypotheses: H1) The Liliuokalani Seamounts and Hess Rise were formed by the Marquesas Mantle Plume. H2) The Pitcairn Mantle Plume is the primary source of the Karin Ridge and Mid-Pacific Mountains. H3) The Mid-Pacific Mountains record the timing and orientation of Cretaceous plate motion changes. H4) The structure of the Mid-Pacific Mountains and Hess Rise are controlled by plume ? (distal) ridge interaction through the generation of asthenospheric melt channels. Testing these hypotheses will lead to an improved understanding of mantle plume dynamics and ?bottom-up? controls on oceanic geomorphology and large igneous province construction. Furthermore, mapping the long-lived expressions of mantle plumes allows for unparalleled insight into the mantle source reservoirs that feed hotspot volcanism. The combination of geo-chronology, chemistry and morphology will allow for a significantly improved Pacific absolute plate motion model during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (122-83 Ma).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell-based therapies, especially genetically modi?ed T-cells from the patients themselves, can be effective for a range of diseases including cancers. These modi?ed T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells) and are engineered in a safe manufacturing facility to express CAR molecules on T-cell surfaces. Once CAR T-cells are infused into patients, the selective conjugation of tumor cell protein and CAR T-cell protein triggers T-cell mediated cytotoxicity that kills the tumor cells. However, there are signi?cant barriers to their wider adoption as therapies. These include: (1) safety concerns related to CAR T-cells engineered by viral gene transfer, which is the current method for CAR gene transfer into T-cells. (2) the high expense of CAR T-cell therapy. A large portion of their cost is associated with producing the CAR T-cells in centralized manufacturing facilities. To address these critical issues, this Future Manufacturing Seed Grant (FMSG) research will investigate novel, low-cost mRNA based (viral-free), distributed CAR T-cell manufacturing strategies.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop good manufacturing practice (GMP) enabled low-cost mRNA-based CAR T-cell manufacturing technologies. This project will investigate how bolus injected external cellular mRNA molecules are translated into protein molecules in a time dependent manner. Additionally, this project will study how the initial cellular protein level from bolus injected external mRNA modulates the half-life of cellular protein expression.

Manufacturing is a critical driver of economic growth and technological advancement, yet traditional product design and production planning remain resource-intensive and significantly reliant on expert knowledge. Many small manufacturers struggle to compete due to the high costs and complexity of optimizing product designs and production schedules. The integration of artificial intelligence into manufacturing has the potential to simplify these over-demanding processes. By integrating deep learning into 1. product functional analysis, 2. component design integration, and 3. constraint-aware production planning, this research seeks to help small manufacturers leverage rapid advancement of intelligent automation for scalable and adaptable production. This research supports national interests by fostering small business innovation, increasing economic competitiveness, and expanding workforce development in US manufacturing. This research also contributes to the advancement of artificial intelligence in industrial settings, enhances supply chain resilience, and promotes collaboration between industry and academia through educational and workforce training initiatives.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop an artificial intelligence-assisted product design and production planning system that improves efficiencies in product design, manufacturability assessment, and production planning. To achieve this, this project focuses on three key objectives: (i) developing structured representation learning to accelerate the product design based on functional dependencies that artificial intelligence self-learned from large volumes of historical documents and customer demands; (ii) implementing a knowledge-augmented graph encoding framework to dynamically cluster modular product families and refine scheduling strategies with significantly reduced human intervention; (iii) creating a hybrid and artificial intelligence-assisted production scheduling system that allows refined Monte Carlo algorithms to search and identify the most effective production schedules. This project looks to address fundamental questions such as: (1) how can artificial intelligence enhance design automation while maintaining manufacturability constraints? (2) how can learned constraints be effectively integrated into adaptive production planning? (3) what are the trade-offs between scalability, generalizability, and computational efficiency in artificial intelligence-assisted manufacturing systems? Through validations with real-world manufacturing data and industry collaborations, this research seekd to enable practical and adaptable manufacturing design automation and production optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way to help nerves heal is by using tissue scaffolds, which are tube shaped structures that act as bridges to reconnect damaged nerves. However, scaffolds do not always work as well as desired because they interact in complex ways with the nerves, and these interactions are not fully understood. This research focuses on how scaffolds degrade over time and how that affects nerve healing. The goal of this project is to find better ways to control degradation so that scaffolds can support nerve repair more effectively. To do this, a special printing technique called 3D bioprinting will be used to create scaffolds with precise shapes and structures. Then, scaffold degradation and effects on nerve healing will be studied. By determining how scaffold breakdown influences nerve growth and healing, better scaffolds to improve nerve repair can be designed and developed, which can help patients with nerve injuries. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will receive hands-on training, strengthening the workforce in biomanufacturing and regenerative medicine. This project will also feature interactive outreach activities for local high school students through various programs to expand the next generation of science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>Scaffolding strategies for repairing injured peripheral nerves with critical nerve gaps remain a significant challenge. Limited regeneration is primarily attributed to the intricate interactions between nerve tissue and scaffolds, which are inherently complex and not yet fully understood, particularly concerning scaffold degradation. While degradable scaffolds are generally associated with superior nerve regeneration compared to non-degradable ones, the underlying mechanisms linking scaffold degradation to enhanced peripheral nerve repair remain insufficiently elucidated. Specifically, the optimal degradation rates that facilitate changes in porous structures to support nerve regeneration have yet to be determined. This research aims to elucidate the influence of material composition and structural design on the degradation of bioprinted tissue scaffolds and establish the mechanistic connections between degradation and peripheral nerve regeneration. First, a comprehensive analysis will be conducted to determine how scaffold material composition and structural design influence degradation, and the subsequent impact on Schwann cell functionality?the key supporting cells in the peripheral nervous system?will be quantified. Next, scaffold degradation will be assessed in vivo using non-invasive imaging techniques, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of its relationship with sciatic nerve regeneration in a rat model. This research will provide critical mechanistic insights into the role of scaffold degradation in nerve repair and introduce innovative methodologies for quantifying scaffold integrity both in vitro and in vivo, advancing peripheral nerve treatment strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communities also must decide how to allocate human resources across space and time, such as deploying police officers across different beats for crime prevention or outreach workers across neighborhoods for eviction prevention. This project aims to understand the ways algorithmic techniques for prioritization and resource allocation can best be used for societal benefit in such domains.

In addition, the work will impact policy through collaborations with community partners and support the transdisciplinary training of diverse students. <br/><br/>At a technical level, the project will focus on several research problems important for developing fair and trustworthy AI. These include: (1) The design of algorithmic techniques for facilitating individualized deployment of scarce societal resources based on (potentially poorly calibrated and semantically ambiguous) risk scores, using rank information and/or learned transformations of cardinal risk scores. (2) Developing foundational models for fair and efficient deployment of human resources (e.g., police officers, caseworkers, schoolteachers, and specialists) across space and time, including definitions of fairness in such settings. (3) Using interpretable machine learning to characterize current human decision-making in public-facing positions and analyzing the efficiency and fairness of current approaches versus algorithmic ones. (4) Elicitation of truthful information to improve societal decision-making, using ideas from mechanism design and audit games. (5) The design of algorithmic decision support tools that can align the incentives of agents with the local agencies they represent while allowing continued use of discretion.

When overwhelmed by data, people tend to seek and interpret information in a way that supports their preexisting beliefs. This phenomenon is often referred to as confirmation bias. In data communication and visual analytics, confirmation bias can be especially nefarious, even for experienced analysts. Although there is a misconception that statistical models and visualizations present objective truths, in reality, choices in the collection, handling, analysis, and presentation of data can bias people into overly relying on their pre-existing beliefs. This project will closely examine confirmation bias in data analysis by (1) creating models that show how existing beliefs and analytic goals can impact data-driven decision-making, and (2) designing novel analytic interfaces that help analysts make less biased decisions by intelligently suggesting evidence that may disprove a belief. The project team will also create educational materials and collect empirical datasets to help data analysts, researchers, and members of the public think about confirmation bias in visual data communication and interpretation. <br/><br/>This project aims to increase understanding of how confirmation bias manifests in real-world visual data analysis tasks and to develop and evaluate bias-mitigation interventions. The project is structured around four research thrusts. As measuring confirmation bias requires capturing an individual?s beliefs, the researchers will first investigate experimental methods to accurately capture a person's beliefs and mental representations about data patterns and trends in an analytic setting (Thrust I). The researchers will then leverage these methodological findings to measure and model the effect of confirmation bias in low-level visual analytic tasks such as finding correlations (Thrust II), then examine higher-level compositions of these tasks in more realistic analysis settings (Thrust III). Finally, the researchers will design and develop four bias-mitigation interventions to be incorporated into real-world visual analytic tools such as Data Voyager and Jupyter Notebooks, recruiting professional analysts to evaluate them in digital field studies (Thrust IV). This research agenda will advance the understanding of confirmation bias and provide promising interventions to empower data analysts to make better decisions. The researchers will also develop coursework and initiatives that bring together computer science, psychology, and ethics to advance practice and education around visual data analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goal of the project is to develop a swelling-porous media model to understand how traveling waves in the brain drive interstitial fluid flow during phases of sleep, during working memory, and during acute conditions like migraine, brain injury, and seizures. The research will advance the fields of porous media flows, biofluid dynamics, and neuroscience.

The research proposes a rigorous system of volume-averaged conservation equations to model interstitial fluid dynamics in the porous brain cortex. The project will have the following objectives: 1. Model interstitial fluid dynamics by using a volume-averaging technique and deriving a modified Darcy?s law for flows through a porous media with spatiotemporally varying permeability profiles; 2. Quantifying interstitial fluid flow driven by traveling waves by implementing physiological reaction-diffusion equations, traveling wave models, and osmosis-induced porosity fluctuations that will be coupled with the interstitial fluid flow model; and 3. Quantifying the influence of wave properties on interstitial fluid flow by systematically varying the wave properties. Parameter regimes will be identified where interstitial fluid flow is optimized in healthy and diseased brains. The research will constitute the first model of traveling wave-induced interstitial fluid dynamics in the brain cortex and will side-step the experimental bottleneck of visualizing interstitial flow in the cortex.

Large fires often trigger landslides and debris flows. Compounding this issue is LA?s history of intense winter rainfalls called atmospheric rivers. Together they present a significant risk of fire-flood-landslides ?triple-disaster?. The project will implement a new turbidity monitoring network to record post-fire turbidity levels in surface streams to identify the direct impact of fire on water quality. The team will also estimate char cover and soil burn severity from real-time satellite images obtained during the fire events. The data will be used in AI-driven models to establish the first baseline for future post-fire risk assessments and mitigation strategies. The methodology and scientific evidence resulting from this project can be applied broadly to mitigate downstream impacts of wildfires in other fire-affected regions. It advances NSF?s mission to safeguard the nation?s water through innovative data and AI solutions.<br/><br/>This RAPID funding will support a research team to collect critical data to understand the wildfire-induced water quality dynamics in Los Angeles. The research will fulfill three objectives: (1) conduct a 3-month turbidity data collection campaign in LA at strategically selected sites aligned with burn areas and high debris hazard probability to establish the initial post-fire baseline, followed by a 9-month data collection campaign to track turbidity under varying dry and wet conditions, (2) estimate perishable fire data, including char cover and soil burn severity, across the entire fire-affected region in LA, by analyzing high-resolution real-time remote sensing observations collected during and immediately after the fire events, and finally (3) quantify how streamflow and turbidity evolve during potential fire?flood sequences using an AI model and therefore identify drivers that may be controlling the magnitudes and recovery timescale of turbidity toward initial post-fire baseline. These detailed spatiotemporal analyses will not only secure short-lived signatures of post-fire water quality but also pave the way to the first integrated framework for mapping the triggers and timelines of cascading fire-water hazards, which is currently absent for the LA region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some places, like East Africa, a continent stretches to the point of breaking, forming continental rifts that, after a period of time, can form new oceans. Numerous studies show that continental rifts develop along weakened zones caused by deep intrusions of  magma. Some continental rifts, however, form without evidence of magma intrusions and are known as magma-poor or ""dry"" rifts. In this project, an investigation of the East African Rift System will take place along the Northern Western Branch located in Uganda, East Africa where magma-poor rifting is taking place. A wide range of geophysical, geological, and geochemical observations will be collected, and numerical modeling of the region will be performed to advance our understanding of how these magma-poor rifts form and evolve. In conjunction with the scientific investigation, ]Ugandan partners will be engaged in data collection techniques. Ugandan and US graduate students will participate, underrepresented students mentored, and several open-access data sets and model products shall be developed. Societal implications of this study include advances in rifting models used for hydrocarbon exploration, improved estimates of CO2 flux into the atmosphere that occurs during continental rifting, and new insights into seismic hazards associated with active faulting. The scientific results of this project will be communicated, in part, through short educational videos geared towards public audiences.<br/> <br/><br/>Continental rifting is an integral component of the plate tectonic paradigm, yet speculation remains about the physical processes involved in magma-poor/-dry rifting. The goal of this project is to apply a combination of geophysical, geological, geochemical and geodynamic techniques to the Northern Western Branch of the East African Rift System in Uganda to test 3 hypotheses: (1) in magma-rich rifts, strain is accommodated through lithospheric weakening from melt, (2) in magma-poor rifts, melt is present below the surface and weakens the lithosphere such that strain is accommodated during upper crustal extension, and (3) in magma-poor rifts, there is no melt at depth and strain is accommodated along pre-existing structures such as inherited compositional, structural, and rheological lithospheric heterogeneities. Observational methods in this project include: passive seismic to constrain lithospheric structure and flow patterns; gravity to constrain variations in crustal and lithospheric thickness; magnetics to constrain the thermal structure of the upper crust; magnetotellurics to constrain lithospheric thickness and the presence of melt; GNSS to constrain surface motions, extension rates, and help characterize mantle flow; geologic mapping to document the geometry and kinematics of active faults; seismic reflection analyses of intra-rift faults to document temporal strain migration; geochemistry to quantify mantle-derived fluids in hot springs and gases; and geodynamic modeling to develop new models of magma-poor rifting processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A Digital Twin is a purpose-driven replica of some physical component, such as a machine or a process. A Digital Twin collects real-time data from its physical counterpart, and uses this data, together with one or more models, to estimate or make predictions about important metrics, such as system health and product quality. Using these estimates or predictions, decisions can be made to improve quality and cost-effectiveness through reduced downtime and wasted raw materials. For example, machines in a factory may degrade slowly, resulting in inferior product quality, but such degradations may not be noticed right away. Predictions from Digital Twins can be used to alert manufacturers to degrading health of their machines, before significant quality issues arise. The mission of the Center is to generate pre-competitive research outcomes for its members (and the manufacturing industry in general) towards the advancement of Digital Twin technology, and consolidate many current Digital Twin solutions around a common framework to advance extensibility, reusability, and interoperability of the solution components across different manufacturing settings. To empower the manufacturing workforce, materials will be developed for education, training, and workforce development. <br/> <br/>The IUCRC-DTM will initially propose three thrust areas. (1) Digital Twin Frameworks and Standards: development of a Digital Twin framework that is maintainable and extensible, incorporates existing solutions and solution threads, is reusable (within and across domains), and exhibits inheritance and generalization, interoperability and exploration into new domains. (2) Digital Twin Applications: improving key components of Digital Twins such as reconfiguration, aggregation, and human interfaces, as well as identification of key use cases of Digital Twins models in various manufacturing sectors. (3) Digital Twin Tools and Workforce Development: creation of software tools, workforce development materials/programs, and high-quality datasets to prepare future workforces and successfully deploy Digital Twins in the manufacturing industry. Through integration of research projects across these three thrusts, the Center seeks to advance several transformative concepts in Digital Twins, including novel knowledge representations, aggregation and composition methods for Digital Twins, and automatic generation and maintenance of Digital Twins. The Arizona State University (ASU) Site will leverage existing testbeds including a connected robotic manufacturing system and wire-laser metal deposition system. The ASU affiliated faculty brings in synergistic expertise on multi-physics simulation, stochastic modeling, robotics, and machine learning, with projects addressing the needs of aerospace, semiconductor, and energy sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team will use sediment core of glacial deposits in Antarctica, coupled with drone-based mapping and precise isotopic dating on Snowball Earth deposits in Namibia, to construct a rate-dependent stratigraphic model. They will also develop a research exchange between University of Namibia and UCSB to train students in the field in Namibia and in the lab in California.

Previous studies have suggested that water-lain sediments deposited during Snowball Earth are incompatible with a weak hydrologic cycle. A proposed reconciliation is that during late stages of Snowball Earth with high CO2, ice-sheets could respond to orbital forcing leading to a more active hydrological cycle. However, because these studies have not been able to constrain rate, it is unclear if the apparent cyclicity in these stratigraphic sections is due to Quaternary-like orbital forcing or autogenic processes internal to the ice sheet that have little to do with external forcings.

A major health risk associated with wildfires is increased ambient air pollution, most notably increased nanoscale particulate matter, which can affect populations hundreds of miles away and result in adverse environmental and health effects. The recent wildfires in Los Angeles burned biomass and human-made structures, such as buildings, furnishings and vehicles, which resulted in the release of nanoparticles with complicated physical and chemical properties and unique toxicological profiles.  Without extensive characterization of the nanoparticle emissions, the potential environmental and health risks to affected populations remain unknown.  This project will provide that characterization of emissions by analyzing nanoparticle and fly ash samples that have been collected in the Los Angeles area.

MTPs are one of the rare materials that exhibit stable inherent ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism, even at single atomic layer or few-layer thicknesses. Unlocking their potential requires understanding how their structure and electrical properties depend on thickness and temperature, and how they handle thermal transport and responses (how they generate, absorb, and release heat). In many applications, it is also important to know how these materials respond to external stimuli such as electric and magnetic fields and pressure. Additionally, understanding how heat is absorbed or released during a phase transition in these materials is useful for optimizing their energetic performance. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework to study MTPs' thermal transport properties focusing on effects of temperature, material properties, and external stimuli. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored leveraging collaboration between the University of Virginia and the Air Force Research Laboratory, contributing to workforce development in academia and Air Force. The project will also engage the broader community through K-12 workshops and a summer program for high school students.<br/><br/> MTPs are moderate- to wide-bandgap semiconductors with a host of diverse ferroic properties making them strong candidates for gate-tunable, switchable memristors and non-volatile memory devices. These materials have the potential to revolutionize next-generation nanoelectronics, particularly in the fields of spintronics and neuromorphic computing. Furthermore, many MTPs exhibit incipient, or even finite ionic conductivity at moderate temperatures. This, in turn, leads to the possibility of structural phase transitions and intriguing new thermochemistry. Over the past decade, significant attention has been focused on this class of materials, particularly in identifying their magnetic, electric, and structural phases. However, their thermal transport properties?and the effects of temperature, thickness, intercalation, doping, and external stimuli such as pressure, electric fields, and magnetic fields?have rarely been studied. The vision of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive theoretical and experimental framework for studying phonons, heat generation, and heat transfer?primarily via phonons and ions- in ferroelectric MTPs, including ferrielectric (e.g., CuInP2S6), antiferroelectric (e.g., CuBiP2 Se6), and multiferroic (e.g., CuCrP2S6 ) materials. Leveraging collaboration between the University of Virginia and the Air Force, the team will grow ferroelectric MTP single crystals and characterize their crystal structure, electronic and phononic dispersion, ferroelectric and magnetic domains and phases, as well as their thermal, and where relevant, electrical and magnetic transport properties under external stimuli.

However, combustion of ammonia can lead to very high pollutant emissions. For example, nitrous oxide can form in low-temperature regions of engines because combustion is slow in these regions.  Low-temperature regions often are located near engine walls where heat is lost to surroundings. The slow combustion there is called wall quenching.  This project addresses the role of wall quenching in generating emissions in ammonia combustion. The project will use numerical simulations of the flow and chemical reactions to describe the generation of nitrous oxide in wall quenching regions.  The results of the project will be predictive computational models that can then be used to provide design rules. Optimized ammonia combustion systems with minimum pollutant emissions could have an enormous impact on several combustion applications such as heavy-duty marine engines.  As part of this research program, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in combustion, turbulence, computational fluid dynamics, software engineering, and high-performance computing.<br/><br/>The goal of this award is to computationally investigate emissions in ammonia wall quenching processes and provide a predictive computational model for engineering simulations. First, detailed numerical simulations will be conducted for laminar and turbulent wall quenching in multiple configurations to understand the influence of geometry and wall conditions on the wall quenching phenomena with a specific emphasis on nitrous oxide formation. Second, a new Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation for Reacting Flows framework will be developed for the reacting flow processes near the wall. In brief, evolution equations for the complete set of species mass fractions and energy are solved only near the wall, and a more computationally efficient combustion model is used away from the wall. Finally, the wall modeling framework will be applied to a wide parametric sweep of ammonia combustion wall quenching to better understand undesirable conditions that should be avoided in ammonia combustion systems. These results will be used to train a data-based wall model for implementation into other codes that will be shared publicly. The modeling framework will allow for the efficient computational modeling of emissions from ammonia combustion, which can be leveraged to accelerate the development of new ammonia combustion technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using these dilute sources benefits society as they are not obtained from mining, which is resource intensive and environmentally unfriendly. The process developed in this project will use electricity to trap the lithium ions in a solid crystalline host material, called intercalation. This intercalation material will be tuned to selectively trap only lithium, excluding other ions present in the solution to create a high-quality lithium ion source. This project aims to encourage participation in STEM by outreach to students in grades 5-9 and recruiting undergraduate veterans for research internships. The education and outreach materials will be disseminated to the public via open-access websites and channels to make additional impact.<br/><br/>This research will (i) unveil the Li selectivity limit based on the FePO4 host and electrochemical intercalation method, which can be translated to other critical element separation; (ii) generate new fundamental knowledge to optimize Li selectivity to major ions at high reaction rates through morphology, diffusion length, and defect control; (iii) develop 4D-STEM into a powerful tool to reveal atomic and nanoscopic level phase and defect features in inorganic materials, which the materials science community can adopt immediately; (iv) design integrated processes and workflow to realize electrochemical Li feedstock production from mining from dilute unconventional Li sources; (v) gain the capability to predict material degradation to guide further manufacturing investigation direction.

However, combustion of ammonia can lead to very high pollutant emissions. For example, nitrous oxide can form in low-temperature regions of engines because combustion is slow in these regions.  Low-temperature regions often are located near engine walls where heat is lost to surroundings. The slow combustion there is called wall quenching.  This project addresses the role of wall quenching in generating emissions in ammonia combustion. The project will use numerical simulations of the flow and chemical reactions to describe the generation of nitrous oxide in wall quenching regions.  The results of the project will be predictive computational models that can then be used to provide design rules. Optimized ammonia combustion systems with minimum pollutant emissions could have an enormous impact on several combustion applications such as heavy-duty marine engines.  As part of this research program, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in combustion, turbulence, computational fluid dynamics, software engineering, and high-performance computing.<br/><br/>The goal of this award is to computationally investigate emissions in ammonia wall quenching processes and provide a predictive computational model for engineering simulations. First, detailed numerical simulations will be conducted for laminar and turbulent wall quenching in multiple configurations to understand the influence of geometry and wall conditions on the wall quenching phenomena with a specific emphasis on nitrous oxide formation. Second, a new Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation for Reacting Flows framework will be developed for the reacting flow processes near the wall. In brief, evolution equations for the complete set of species mass fractions and energy are solved only near the wall, and a more computationally efficient combustion model is used away from the wall. Finally, the wall modeling framework will be applied to a wide parametric sweep of ammonia combustion wall quenching to better understand undesirable conditions that should be avoided in ammonia combustion systems. These results will be used to train a data-based wall model for implementation into other codes that will be shared publicly. The modeling framework will allow for the efficient computational modeling of emissions from ammonia combustion, which can be leveraged to accelerate the development of new ammonia combustion technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators are focusing on the points where the ice meets the ocean. With special sensors measuring vibrations and temperature, the investigators aim to measure where and when icebergs detach from the glacier and fall into the ocean. The investigators also want to find out where warm ocean water is melting the ice and if there is a connection to the speed at which the glacier flows into the ocean. The measurements will help us learn more about how Greenland's glaciers will change in the future and what that might mean for sea levels around the world. In collaboration with a local Greenlandic teacher-trainee, the scientific results of the study and their implications for local communities will be disseminated in Greenland?s classrooms.<br/><br/>The proposal aims to test the hypothesis that a regime change in melt source regions occurs during the spring-to-summer transition period, shifting from temperature-dominated melt and calving to sub-glacial discharge-dominated processes. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will deploy a new optical fiber instrument at the calving front of the Qajuuttap Sermia tidewater glacier in Greenland. This instrument will measure acoustic and temperature data to better understand the effect of sub-glacial melt and discharge on calving. The project will generate novel measurements from Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems, making a compelling proof-of-concept for glacier-ocean interface observations, an environment that is notoriously treacherous for equipment and personnel. The inclusion of broadband instruments on land, seismometers on the ocean bottom, and conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) casts from boats will provide important benchmarks against the measurements from DTS/DAS. The project will support two early-career researchers, one postdoc, and an undergraduate in a University of Washington hosted summer research program.

Treatments that are designed to restore movement, but do not help restore a sense of touch, have limited benefits to patients.  A treatment to restore the sense of touch will rely on a sensor that can measure the force skin exerts on an object when the object is touched. Currently available wearable sensors are bulky, and they interfere with the way skin interacts with touched objects.  To address this technology gap, this project will develop a minimally invasive, wireless device that can be placed under the skin and can determine forces caused by touching an object.  The device will do this by using light to measure changes in blood volume.  The implantable sensor will send signals that bypass damaged nerves and communicate with the brain.  Such a device could significantly improve the quality of life for people who have suffered stroke or spinal cord injury.  In addition, the project will help train a future workforce by involving a team comprising high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to participate in sensor design and fabrication.<br/><br/><br/>The sense of touch is critical to dexterous use of the hands and thus an essential component to efforts to restore hand function after paralysis. The latest advance in functional restoration of a patient?s own paralyzed hand is reanimation through brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation (BC-FES). However, to date, this approach has not included somatosensory feedback. BC-FES places additional demands on tactile sensor design not incurred with brain-controlled robotic limbs. In this project, minimally invasive implantable tactile sensors suitable for long-term use in a patient?s own home will be developed. The proposed implantable sensors utilize an optical sensing mechanism, photoplethysmography (PPG), to indirectly infer tactile forces acting on the skin from blood volume changes in the compressed skin capillaries. The strategy has previously been validated, but only with bulky wearable devices. This project will develop and test a fully wireless, battery free, and hermetically sealed PPG sensor for subcutaneous deployment as an artificial mechanoreceptor. Fundamental engineering knowledge will be gained in the refinement of the three main functional components of the system: (1) an ultralow-power custom integrated circuit for PPG, (2) support for wireless radiofrequency (RF) power and data links, and (3) an optically and RF transparent, hermetic, fused silica package for long-term viability under the skin. Wireless functionality and hermeticity of prototype sensor systems will be rigorously tested in preclinical models in vivo. Beyond the intended neuroprosthetic use case, implantable PPG sensors could have tremendous impact in other applications, given that the PPG signal contains information on respiratory, vascular, cardiac, and autonomic nervous system functions. Technology development here could directly translate to a minimally invasive device for continuous physiological monitoring relevant to many chronic conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A Digital Twin is a purpose-driven replica of some physical component, such as a machine or a process. A Digital Twin collects real-time data from its physical counterpart, and uses this data, together with one or more models, to estimate or make predictions about important metrics, such as system health and product quality. Using these estimates or predictions, decisions can be made to improve quality and cost-effectiveness through reduced downtime and wasted raw materials. For example, machines in a factory may degrade slowly, resulting in inferior product quality, but such degradations may not be noticed right away. Predictions from Digital Twins can be used to alert manufacturers to degrading health of their machines, before significant quality issues arise. The mission of the Center is to generate pre-competitive research outcomes for its members (and the manufacturing industry in general) towards the advancement of Digital Twin technology, and consolidate many current Digital Twin solutions around a common framework to advance extensibility, reusability, and interoperability of the solution components across different manufacturing settings. To empower the manufacturing workforce, materials will be developed for education, training, and workforce development. <br/> <br/>The IUCRC-DTM will initially propose three thrust areas. (1) Digital Twin Frameworks and Standards: development of a Digital Twin framework that is maintainable and extensible, incorporates existing solutions and solution threads, is reusable (within and across domains), and exhibits inheritance and generalization, interoperability and exploration into new domains. (2) Digital Twin Applications: improving key components of Digital Twins such as reconfiguration, composition, and human interfaces, as well as identification of key use cases of Digital Twins models in various manufacturing sectors. (3) Digital Twin Tools and Workforce Development: creation of software tools, workforce development materials/programs, and high-quality datasets to prepare future workforces and successfully deploy Digital Twins in the manufacturing industry. Through integration of research projects across these three thrusts, the Center seeks to advance several transformative concepts in Digital Twins, including novel knowledge representations, aggregation and composition methods for Digital Twins, and automatic generation and maintenance of Digital Twins. The University of Michigan Site will leverage the system-level manufacturing automation research testbed, with additive and subtractive processes, collaborative robots, and integrated data collection and visualization.

The use of tax preparation software has witnessed a significant increase, with over 72 million people utilizing it in 2020. However, there has been limited independent research conducted to assess the accountability of tax software. This project takes on two main challenges: i) ensuring the software's compliance, accuracy, and fairness based on tax law and experts' perspectives, and ii) enhancing scalability and precision in testing, debugging, and patching tax software. The project specifically focuses on exemptions, credits, and deductions for low-income taxpayers, with the aim of ensuring that all taxpayers, including those from vulnerable communities, pay all and only the taxes that tax law prescribes.<br/><br/>While it is expected that software with legal and social implications should be fair and compliant with the law, the absence of formal specifications regarding expected behaviors in legal-critical domains like tax software poses significant challenges in ensuring accountability. Since U.S. tax law adheres to the legal doctrine of precedent (stare decisis), this project proposes that these specifications naturally exist as metamorphic relationships between individuals who are considered similar within a given context. The project team plans to 1) explicate metamorphic relations from a large set of challenging requirements in U.S. tax law, 2) automate the extraction of such metamorphic relations by leveraging principles from the psychology of perception pertaining to relateness, 3) develop artifacts for assessing tax software that leverages those relations using formal verification techniques, and 4) experimentally compare the tax software's accuracy and perception of procedural justice to that of human tax experts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The US has a critical minerals and materials problem. The decay of American mining, processing, and refining capacity has led to supply chain disruption risks for many minerals and materials needed for national defense and economic development. The US currently imports $102B worth of processed mineral materials (mostly critical minerals) that ultimately support $3.62 trillion in economic activity. The US heavily relies on imports of 38 of the 50 critical minerals, including 26 that China effectively monopolizes. Addressing this challenge requires government, academia, and private industry to work collaboratively to establish the right policy framework, conduct research and development, build mines and processing facilities (including recycling facilities), train and develop a workforce, and other initiatives to ensure resilient supply of critical minerals to support the nation. Missouri University of Science & Technology (Missouri S&T) will convene a hybrid in-person/virtual workshop on August 6?7, 2025 at Missouri S&T in Rolla, MO. The theme for the workshop is ?Empowering a Vibrant Workforce: Leveraging Critical Minerals Research to Drive Innovation and Growth.? The workshop will start with a keynote session on workforce development that sets the tone for the entire workshop. Following the keynote session will be a panel discussion on educational programs to prepare the workforce for the critical minerals sector. The workshop will then have three sessions on exploration and engineering, processing, and recycling, and policy.

Ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrasses, and wetlands serve as natural barriers against these threats, with mangroves being particularly effective due to their dense and complex root systems. These root structures help dissipate wave energy, slow flood currents, and reduce coastal erosion. However, despite their proven potential, mangroves remain underutilized in engineered coastal defense strategies due to limited understanding of their interaction with hydrodynamic forces. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by experimentally investigating how mangrove root structures influence wave and current dynamics. Advancing this understanding will improve predictive wave models for coastal management and support the integration of mangroves into resilient, nature-based coastal protection strategies. Additionally, this project will provide hands-on research opportunities for students in STEM and engage in community outreach to raise public awareness about nature-based solutions and sustainable coastal resilience.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between mangrove root systems and coastal waves and currents. Specifically, the research will focus on three key objectives: (1) to evaluate how mangrove root morphology influences hydrodynamic processes under various conditions (wave, current, and combined wave-current flows), (2) to examine how currents modify wave dynamics within mangrove environments, and (3) to analyze the turbulence generated by the interaction of waves, currents, and mangrove root structures. Laboratory experiments will use scaled 3D models that closely replicate natural mangrove root morphology. Advanced measurement techniques, including Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV), will be used to measure detailed flow dynamics and turbulence, while direct force measurements will enable precise calculation of drag and inertia coefficients. By addressing the complex and often overlooked interactions between waves, currents, and vegetation, this research will improve the parameterization of vegetation effects in coastal wave models leading to more accurate predictions of wave attenuation and current reduction. The findings of this project will support the integration of nature-based solutions into coastal planning, inform the design of hybrid protection systems that combine natural ecosystems with engineered infrastructure, and promote climate adaptation strategies for more resilient coastal communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viral vectors that deliver therapeutic genes to target organs are central to these therapies. However, current production systems to generate functional vectors also generate by-products such as empty or incorrectly filled viruses. Detecting these defective particles is critical for ensuring the efficacy and safety of gene therapies.  However, available analytical tools are labor-intensive and costly. This project leverages the discovery that the surface structure of a virus depends on the genetic material it carries.  The project will use molecular fingers called ""ligands"" that are engineered to bind to the surface of functional viruses differently than they bind to defective ones. This binding will be analyzed using label-free biosensing technologies with high sensitivity and accuracy. This research has three aims: first, to study ligand interactions with full and empty viruses; second, to integrate these ligands with Extended-Gate Field Effect Transistor (EGFET) biosensors, creating an ""electrochemical dictionary"" for interpreting the ligand-to-virus binding events; and third, to validate this technology with therapeutic viruses. This approach could be extended to detecting disease-causing viruses and engineering sensors for environmental or industrial applications. Biotech and biopharma communities will be engaged through professional presentations, academic meetings, and student involvement, fostering the adoption of this biosensing technology in research and industry. <br/><br/>Quantifying viral titer and gene loading is critical for assessing viral infectivity and ensuring the safety and efficacy of gene therapies utilizing viral vectors to deliver therapeutic transgenes. Recent findings on the relationships between viral capsid biomolecular features, genetic payloads, and virion transduction activity have significant implications for viral vector manufacturing and diagnostic analysis. Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) exemplify this potential, as their capsid surface signals the presence of therapeutic genes. However, AAV production often yields heterogeneous mixtures, including empty and misloaded capsids that can induce genotoxicity and immunogenicity. Current analytical assays for quantifying the titers of capsid, encapsulated transgenes, and infectious units are laborious and inaccurate, causing delays and uncertainty in treating patients. To address these challenges, this project will develop ""Bio-Censors"" that use affinity ligands recognizing capsid features specific to gene-loaded versus empty AAVs to simultaneously quantify capsid and transgene titers. The research approach integrates peptide ligands with pH-controlled affinity for AAVs, microfluidic devices for pH tuning, and multiplexed EGFET biosensors. In Aim 1, peptide ligands' differential recognition of AAV capsids using surface plasmon resonance-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy will be investigated. Aim 2 focuses on engineering EGFET Bio-Censors to enhance detection and discrimination.

It is common in a wide variety of thermal, energy, and optical systems. Most research has focused on the scenario where the thermal radiation between surfaces is equal in both directions. However, there are important cases where the heat transfer is unequal between surfaces, which is called nonreciprocal radiation exchange. Nonreciprocal radiation exchange is essential in optimizing operations such as solar energy conversion and building insulation. This project will help overcome significant challenges for designing systems with nonreciprocal radiation exchange.  For example, the project will conduct experiments to better understand how wide variations in wave frequency of thermal radiation affect energy exchange.  The project will construct a numerical modeling method suited for calculating nonreciprocal radiation exchange.  Results will help establish a new direction for heat transfer research and generate a direct impact on advanced thermal and energy technologies with significant economic and environmental impacts.  The project will also support educational activities including Everything Thermal - a YouTube channel for students and the public to learn about concepts and research in thermal photonics, and P2 - a paper-cutting and painting art demonstration with light and heat to help K-6 students visualize the beauty of symmetry, heat, and optics.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand and control the unique directional heat transfer phenomena associated with nonreciprocal surfaces. The research involves achieving broadband nonreciprocal radiative properties, measuring radiative heat exchange between nonreciprocal surfaces, and exploring the tunability of this radiation exchange. Multilayer magnetized materials will be used to broaden nonreciprocity in the infrared, which will provide a general design rationale to achieve broadband nonreciprocity. A modeling method will be established to directly simulate nonreciprocal radiation exchange between surfaces of various geometries and properties.

Tungsten alloys hold significant promise for use in demanding applications, such as aerospace, defense, medical, and nuclear fields, due to their high density and excellent mechanical properties. High-temperature AM, such as powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition, has been used to fabricate tungsten alloy components with short lead time. Nevertheless, tungsten alloys are extremely refractory and have a remarkable ductile-to-brittle transition that makes the materials highly sensitive to temperature changes. The large temperature gradient and huge heating/cooling rates in high-temperature AM pose critical challenges to the fabrication because of the inherent brittleness of tungsten alloys to cracking, leading to the difficulty in creating highly dense components. To address the challenges, this CAREER project takes a unique manufacturing strategy to better tailor and control the formation and densification of as-built components through compression-enabled filament-extrusion AM, binder removal, and hybrid-phase sintering integrating both solid-phase densification and liquid-phase strengthening. If successful, this project will advance the innovation of next-generation, scalable AM processes for high-performance refractory alloy fabrications.

Individual plate movements can be determined if their past motions are compared to a fixed source on Earth, such as so-called ?mantle hotspots?. These hotspots are generated by mantle plumes, large thermo-chemical uprisings of material that originate on or near the core-mantle boundary. These upwellings of hot material can produce volcanism on Earth?s surface that remains relatively stationary while plates move over them, generating chains of compositionally distinct volcanoes that are progressively older the further they are from the hotspot. This work, through tracing ages, compositions, and morphologies of several poorly-documented volcanic chains, seeks to better understand the timing and drivers of global scale plate reorganization events that took place in the Mid-Cretaceous (120-80 Ma). The target locations include the Liliuokalani Ridge, Hess Rise and Mid-Pacific Mountains in the Central Pacific region. The team will be able to test whether the features were built by mantle plumes that are currently underlying the Northern French Polynesia region. The combined age and chemistry results will then be used to constrain the timing of a major plate reorganization event at ca. 100 Ma. This project supports three early-career scientists, two PhD, and one MSc student. In addition, the seagoing expedition will include eight undergraduate research participants from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and California State University, Long Beach.  <br/><br/><br/>The project involves a 31-day seagoing expedition to dredge seamounts, ridges and rises within and near Hess Rise and the Mid-Pacific Mountains. In addition, the team will analyze basalts recovered on NOAA-Ocean Exploration and Research expeditions from Karin Ridge and samples from an upcoming E/V Nautilus expedition to the Liliuokalani Seamounts. Onshore work will include obtaining 40Ar/39Ar age determinations and geochemical tracers (major and trace elements; Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes) from representative lava flows. These new samples and comprehensive datasets will allow for the testing of the following hypotheses: H1) The Liliuokalani Seamounts and Hess Rise were formed by the Marquesas Mantle Plume. H2) The Pitcairn Mantle Plume is the primary source of the Karin Ridge and Mid-Pacific Mountains. H3) The Mid-Pacific Mountains record the timing and orientation of Cretaceous plate motion changes. H4) The structure of the Mid-Pacific Mountains and Hess Rise are controlled by plume ? (distal) ridge interaction through the generation of asthenospheric melt channels. Testing these hypotheses will lead to an improved understanding of mantle plume dynamics and ?bottom-up? controls on oceanic geomorphology and large igneous province construction. Furthermore, mapping the long-lived expressions of mantle plumes allows for unparalleled insight into the mantle source reservoirs that feed hotspot volcanism.

We recognize that promoting well-being among faculty and students must be a central focus rather than an afterthought of professional education. Accordingly, this project will advance cultures of well-being in engineering education by understanding faculty members? personal experiences of coping with negative emotions and failure within their professional context. Engineering faculty members are highly influential to students who seek their guidance to understand what it means to become an engineer. Faculty are best positioned to influence equitable, inclusive, and healthy cultures of engineering education when their own emotional needs are met. Therefore, this project will examine how faculty members meet their well-being needs and how they use their influence to nurture or inhibit cultures that allow for engineering students to experience well-being. This project aims to transform how faculty relationally connect with students and other faculty and staff by transforming the ways that they understand themselves. In addition to the research plan, which includes intensive interviews with engineering faculty at multiple institutions, this project will also provide direct training to faculty on coping with failures and preserving a positive professional identity. In line with the PI?s career mission, this project will develop and define a scholarship of care within engineering education research that influences national and local policies of well-being through research-informed insights.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will address two significant gaps in extant literature: 1) the role of failure and negative emotions in facilitating or mitigating cultural patterns of well-being; 2) the complex, dynamic nature of the lived emotional experiences of engineering faculty. This project is organized around the following objectives:<br/>Objective 1: Examine social and individual experiences of failure and negative emotions in engineering faculty. <br/>Objective 2: Characterize the link between faculty?s emotional experience and their surrounding cultures of well-being. <br/>Objective 3: Establish a framework to provide training for engineering programs to establish cultures that support healthy strategies for coping with professional failure. <br/><br/>This project will use a qualitative mixed-methods approach that embeds an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) study that examines the lived experiences of professional failure and negative emotions in engineering faculty (Objective 1) within a constructivist grounded theory (CGT) analysis that generates a theoretical model of the relationships between faculty emotional regulation and cultures of well-being (Objective 2). The education plan to develop faculty training on regulating emotions related to professional failure (Objective 3) will be interwoven with the research focus to change cultures of well-being (Objective 2). This study will occur at three purposefully selected institutions and involve 10-12 faculty participants for the IPA study, 18-22 participants that are interviewed twice for the CGT study (36-44 total interviews), and a three-module training series to be delivered at four institutions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) in the Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) Division of Engineering (ENG), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether and in what ways the welfare of adopted and fostered children improves outside their natal environment are subjects of much debate. Important factors affecting the welfare of adopted and fostered children include: the circumstances that lead to adoption and fosterage; differences between the activities and treatment of adopted and fostered children and of biological children; and societal acceptance versus stigma surrounding adoption and fosterage. Understanding how these factors interact to facilitate or inhibit successful outcomes for adopted and fostered children is critical for tailoring family programs to suit the individual needs of the many children who are reared primarily by non-natal parents in the United States. <br/><br/>This research will be conducted in the Melanesian island nation of Vanuatu, where adoption and fosterage are commonplace and arise in contexts comparable to adoption and fosterage among minority populations in the United States. The research team, including a postdoctoral scholar, two ni-Vanuatu graduate students, and an international team of highly trained PIs, will investigate the causes and consequences of adoption and fosterage using an evolutionary framework that seeks to understand how adoption and fosterage contribute to familial success. The researchers will use a diverse set of methods that leverage the significant variation in these practices in Vanuatu to evaluate which specific factors or sets of factors best predict differences in child outcomes. Specifically, the investigators will use questionnaires, interviews, dietary and activity recall assessments, and anthropometric measurements of health to describe the circumstances surrounding adoption and fosterage and to tie such circumstances to differences in child health and well-being. Findings from the research will provide insight into tailoring support for adoptive and foster families by examining how social and demographic factors contribute to variation in the welfare of adopted and fostered children as compared to their biological counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This affects families? abilities to meet household needs and the welfare of family members adopting different subsistence roles. Given the implications of such demographic transitions for individual, family, and societal well-being, changes in family size have been intensively studied, and yet remain poorly resolved, particularly within contexts where relatively large family sizes remain normative. This research project uses theory from cultural and biological anthropology to understand the role that livelihood diversification may play in driving family size in mixed (subsistence and market) economies. It creates new collaborations among minority-serving institutions and research-intensive institutions, offers significant, fully remunerated training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including in field, laboratory, and computational methods, and supports both early career and underrepresented scholars. It disseminates results broadly to stakeholder communities and to academic and non-academic audiences via scholarly presentations and publications and a variety of public-oriented media outlets.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that the need to diversify livelihoods in contexts with mixed economies is associated with larger family sizes than are predicted under typical models of demographic transition. Its first objective is to test whether and how economic and cultural factors influence ideal and realized family sizes. Its second is to investigate how family size affects children?s daily activities, both productive and consumptive, and how activity profiles influence children?s nutrition, energetics, physical fitness, and well-being. To do so, investigators collect data from a large sample of children residing in market-integrated, mixed, and subsistence economies, including data drawn from socio-demographic questionnaires that characterize livelihoods and cultural norms surrounding family size, physical activity and dietary logs, and anthropometric and biomarker assessments of health. Together, these data provide a much more detailed assessment of the patterns, causes, and consequences of family size variation as affected by variation in economic and cultural factors. Results thus inform missing aspects of demographic transition theory by focusing on the proximate means by which families adjust subsistence strategies to accommodate variation in economic and cultural landscapes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these complex networks, vertices symbolize entities, and edges depict their interactions. Large-scale networks are prevalent in scientific and business applications, such as protein similarity networks with billions of vertices and trillions of edges. As networks continue to grow, there is an increasing demand for algorithms and software capable of utilizing large-scale cyberinfrastructure for analyzing massive networks across scientific domains. This project addresses this need by developing a software infrastructure consisting of foundational algorithms for scalable, portable, and user-friendly graph analysis, ensuring scalability to trillions of edges, optimal performance on heterogeneous infrastructures, and accessibility for domain scientists. This software infrastructure directly enhances vital applications in extreme weather prediction, the discovery of novel proteins, and forecasting energy usage in industrial settings. The project extends the accessibility of these advanced technologies to students at various academic levels. Integration with university courses and initiatives for high school students and teachers in rural Indiana ensures widespread educational impact.<br/><br/>A complex network, modeled as a graph in mathematics, reveals intricate topological features encompassing dynamic edges, vertices, and a mixture of static and dynamic ones. Due to such networks' unpredictable and dynamic nature, the independent development of scalable algorithms and software for each application has become prohibitively costly in terms of time, effort, and research funding. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a general-purpose software infrastructure tailored to analyze and learn from complex networks. Users can leverage this infrastructure to expedite a multitude of graph-based applications. Confronting the diversity of graphs and computing platforms, the project employs a flexible two-layer framework. This framework seamlessly maps dynamic graph and machine learning computations to a concise set of sparse matrix operations, followed by the development of parallel algorithms. This linear-algebraic mapping offers a transparent pathway from mathematical algorithm descriptions to sparse-matrix functions, ensuring multiple levels of parallelism, communication reduction, and extreme scalability. Usability, the second challenge in this undertaking, is addressed through a comprehensive set of novel unsupervised and supervised graph algorithms tailored for complex and dynamic networks. Integrating these innovative graph algorithms with massively parallel sparse matrix operations results in a versatile software framework that analyzes complex spatiotemporal systems such as streamflow, traffic flow, and energy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is already bringing damages to the US and elsewhere, and these will continue to get worse with continued emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.  Even with efforts to reduce emissions, there will still be significant impacts, both economic and human, resulting from future climate change.  An additional option that could potentially reduce many climate damages is to cool the planet by reflecting a tiny bit more sunlight back to space.  However, there is not yet sufficient information to support informed decisions.  The two ideas most often suggested are Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB, the main focus of this work) and Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI).  MCB would involve spraying sea salt aerosols into low clouds over the ocean to increase (force) cloud reflectivity, providing local and global cooling.  The regional climate effects and associated impacts of MCB would depend quite strongly on where and how much forcing is applied, suggesting the potential to design an MCB approach to achieve multiple climate objectives. While there has been similar research conducted for SAI, there has been much more limited work treating MCB as a design problem. This project first aims to fill this gap, designing an MCB strategy to simultaneously manage multiple climate objectives by tuning the amount of forcing in different regions.  This is an essential step towards assessing the climate impacts of MCB, and thus evaluating what role it might play in managing future climate risks.  Furthermore, the combination of SAI and MCB may be able to reduce climate impacts better than either alone; the second goal is thus to assess this potential.  Finally, this project will support integration of expertise between climate scientists and engineering, strengthening both disciplines.<br/><br/>Given the risks of climate change, it is essential to understand to what extent different solar geoengineering approaches might contribute to an overall portfolio of response options.  This project will introduce systematic design principles into Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB) research, and will carefully assess how SAI and MCB might complement each other.  Existing MCB simulations have often simply introduced some specified perturbation and evaluated what happens, rather than starting with desired outcomes and determining both where to perturb, and how much forcing to apply in different regions, in order to achieve those outcomes.  The broader MCB research community is now exploring how forcing in different regions affects the climate differently.  This project will leverage this momentum, and build on the experience gained with SAI, by using optimization tools to systematically evaluate MCB as a design problem and develop multi-degree-of-freedom feedback algorithms to achieve desired climate outcomes in the presence of uncertainty.  The approach thus introduces new tools that will be broadly useful for the research community going forward, and defines an approach for systematically evaluating the benefits and risks of MCB.  Furthermore, this approach will enable a simultaneous optimization combining SAI and MCB to assess whether their combination could be ?better? than either alone.  Simulations will be conducted in climate models for different regions, and for combinations of regions.  The final simulations conducted as part of this research will be made available to the climate impacts modeling community to better assess the role of MCB in managing future climate risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional recycling often leads to ""down-cycling,"" where plastics are converted into lower-quality materials with limited use. One promising recycling approach is hydrogenolysis, which transforms plastic waste into valuable materials and chemicals by breaking down plastics like polyethylene into smaller, higher-value chemicals using metal catalysts and hydrogen gas. Unlike conventional chemical recycling methods, hydrogenolysis operates under milder conditions without the need for harmful solvents, making it a more sustainable solution. However, there are challenges in adopting this technology for widespread use owing to low efficiency, undesirable byproducts, and difficulties in scaling the process for industry. This CAREER award aims to overcome these obstacles using advanced computational tools based on quantum mechanics, machine learning, and statistical thermodynamics. The goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms of hydrogenolysis for the world's most common plastic polyethylene, and develop new predictive models for optimizing its efficiency and selectivity. This research promotes global environmental preservation and circular economies by designing sustainable chemical processes to reduce plastic waste. The proposed work also integrates research with educational and outreach activities to enhance computational literacy among students. <br/><br/>This CAREER award focuses on uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemical upcycling of polyethylene, the world's most common plastic. As the amount of plastic in our environment steadily increases, there is an urgent need for efficient recycling methods. Chemical recycling based on hydrogenolysis offers a promising approach to managing plastic waste by deconstructing long-chain polymers with metal catalysts and hydrogen gas to create smaller hydrocarbon products, some of which are high-value chemical commodities. Despite progress in converting polyethylene into liquid fuels, challenges remain in controlling the reaction specificity and efficiency of waste-to-liquid fuel conversion, due to the limited understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this conversion. A comprehensive understanding of these complex systems has remained elusive because of the difficulties associated with ab initio methods in producing free energy landscapes relevant to operando conditions. The integrated education and outreach program seeks to enhance computational literacy among students,from K-12 to college. Proposed activities include developing computational materials science laboratory courses for chemistry, physics, and engineering undergraduate and graduate students, as well as creating open-source online tools based on the simulation code and data generated from this research. Additionally, workshops and curricula on materials sustainability and computational research will be designed for students in collaboration with a local nonprofit specializing in cognitive-behavioral training.

These materials have a very low thermal conductivity, which makes them potentially useful in thermal insulation applications.  Improved materials for thermal insulation could lead to significant energy savings in the US.  However, the complexity of aerogels at the nanoscale presents challenges to describing and manipulating heat transfer inside the material, which could limit its potential use in practice.  This project will use computational simulations to better understand the relationships between the structure of aerogels and their physical properties, which could provide designers with knowledge to optimize their behavior.  Results from the project will yield direct economic benefits such as energy-efficient nanomaterials, as well as societal benefits in agricultural, environmental, and healthcare applications. Educational activities supported by the project will raise nanotechnology awareness across educational levels and help expand the future science and engineering workforce. <br/><br/>Aerogels' properties, such as pore size, porosity, and solid-network, can be tailored during synthesis, but predicting the resulting heat transfer behavior is challenging due to the nanoscale size of the porous system and the solid skeleton. Current theories fail to explain nanoscale heat transfer accurately, and experimental methods lack precise structure-property correlation. To address this knowledge gap, this project will provide a detailed characterization of true nanoscale heat transfer behavior as a function of corresponding physical parameters. The pore-level interfacial and nanoscopic transport mechanisms contributing to aerogel heat transfer will be resolved to obtain a multi-scale structure-property correlation for aerogel design, assisted by machine learning. An accurate description of nanoscale heat transfer mechanisms requires molecular-level calculations. To address this, molecular dynamics simulations will be used to accurately model solid and gas conduction and their combined effective behavior, considering nanoscale mechanism. This project will advance knowledge on heat transfer behavior of (i) complex solid nano-networks with structural characterization, (ii) nano-confined gases under molecular surface effects with rarefaction characterization, and (iii) gas/solid interfaces.

Atrial fibrillation, the irregular beating of the heart?s left atrium, is the most common heart rhythm disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. This condition leads to a four to five-fold increase in stroke risk. More than 90% of the blood clots that result in stroke are confined to the left atrial appendage due to low blood velocities in this region of the heart. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the differences in left atrial geometry and tissue structure contribute to clot growth and clot breakup that can lead to stroke. This project will create a computational model of the left atrium to investigate how the heart?s structure changes blood flow patterns, elevating the risk of clot breakup. The knowledge gained from this project could have a far-reaching impact on other applications where clotting is a major risk, such as deep vein thrombosis and prosthetic heart valves. Further, this research will be integrated into an educational program and outreach plan under the theme of Engineering for Cardiovascular Health and Wellness. This includes enhanced coursework with hands-on projects and on-site and virtual research opportunities. These activities are designed to promote interest in STEM careers while fostering awareness of heart disease and biomechanics research.<br/><br/>The research goals of this project are (i) to understand how the left atrial geometric and structural characteristics correlate with arrhythmogenic contraction and thrombogenic blood flow pattern and (ii) to interrogate how the left atrial tissue-blood interactions destabilize a clot to embolize, thereby leading to stroke. These goals intend to be met by creating an enhanced multiphysics cardiac biomechanics modeling framework capturing coagulation cascade and blood-clot interactions. Specific research objectives include (1) to create arrhythmogenic excitation-contraction patterns by varying the left atrial geometric and structural parameters, including size, tissue thickness, pulmonary vein attachments, and the extent of tissue fibrosis, (2) to evaluate the thrombogenicity of aberrant wall motions triggered due to atrial fibrillation, and (3) to understand blood-clot interactions in the setting of a deforming left atrial appendage. Critical questions to be answered include: (a) Do all atrial fibrillations trigger clots? (b) Is the clot severity associated with geometric hotspots and structural remodeling patterns? (c) What hemodynamic mechanisms are responsible for clot fragmentation and dissociation into emboli?

These impurities must be removed to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy. Most current separation methods are not designed to purify these emerging therapeutics, creating bottlenecks in drug discovery and manufacturing pipelines. More effective separation methods could accelerate development and accessibility of these medicines and reduce costs for patients and pharmaceutical companies. This project will design innovative, biology-inspired adsorptive separation materials using peptides, a type of biopolymer, to purify new medicines from contaminants.  Knowledge gained about the materials will be used to build an engineering toolbox to optimize the design of highly efficient separation materials and predict their performance in manufacturing. The project will also help train a domestic workforce equipped to tackle the challenges associated with manufacturing these novel therapeutics. An annual summer workshop for engineering students will be established, offering hands-on training in biomanufacturing processes and cutting-edge modeling tools to facilitate rapid and reliable design of these critical systems.<br/><br/>This project will leverage rationally designed short peptides to advance the molecular understanding of protein adsorption onto functionalized surfaces and establish design rules linking the chemistry and architecture of mixed-mode peptide ligands featuring synergistic interaction modes to protein adsorption behaviors. Using these materials, the investigator will determine how factors such as grafting density, ligand flexibility, ion type, and the spatial arrangement of charge and hydrophobic chemical groups influence protein adsorption in chromatographic systems and other functionalized surfaces. Furthermore, this project will quantitatively examine how these ligand properties dictate which protein surface characteristics govern interactions in non-specific adsorption systems. Taken together, these insights will enable the identification and synthesis of a small set of orthogonally selective mixed-mode chromatographic resins capable of efficiently purifying a wide range of protein therapeutic modalities.

This project will 1) Develop and validate a multiscale method for coupling phonon transport with ion conduction, capturing both long-range mesoscale structures and sublattice anharmonic vibrations; 2) Utilize a pre-selected list of geometric configurations to test the hypothesis of defect-induced phonon localization/delocalization; 3) Measure the relationship between mode-specific phonon excitation and ion diffusivity, testing the hypothesis of phonon localization-induced ion hop; 4) Integrate research into education through a variety of project-based activities to promote learning among peers and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dramatic damage repeatedly occurs on low-rise building roofs during windstorms, as observed in recent hurricanes Matthew (2016), Maria (2017), and Michael (2018). Building roof failure often starts at the windward roof edges and corners, where extreme peak suctions are induced by flow separation and unsteady vortices. Improved understanding of vortex dynamics governing the worst roof suction and smart flow control strategies by learning from nature will contribute towards more accurate wind load prediction, enhanced wind design provisions, and reduction of wind-induced damage and economic and life losses, and thus advance post-windstorm national welfare and prosperity. The bio-inspiration approach will not only produce cost-effective, high-performance mitigation strategies for low-rise buildings, but will also motivate new thinking in broader engineering fields. This research will use the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind (WOW) facility at Florida International University (FIU). Experimental datasets will be archived in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org) and be made publicly available for validation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. To strengthen the persistence of engineering students, first-year undergraduate students will be engaged in a new learning community by integrating scientific questions into team-based, early research experiences, as well as weekly open workshops and invited seminars. The learning community program will improve the STEM infrastructure, broaden underrepresented groups? participation in engineering, and build a pipeline for the engineering workforce.  This project will support the investigator's long-term career vision focused on fundamental research on wind-structure interaction and bio-inspired flow control to increase the wind resilience of civil infrastructure that contributes to community resilience and sustainability. This award contributes to the National Science Foundation's role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). <br/><br/>The specific research objectives are the following: (1) quantify three-dimensional, transient rooftop vortices from hurricane-type high winds of high Reynolds numbers, (2) correlate the unsteady vortices with roof peak pressures, and (3) utilize bio-inspiration as an innovation tool to create cost-effective wind mitigation devices, ultimately enhancing the wind resiliency of low-rise buildings. A series of well-controlled wind tunnel experiments with unsteady flow and pressure over a scaled low-rise building model will be conducted at Cleveland State University and the FIU WOW facility. Systematic measurements of the unsteady three-dimensional vortical flow at high Reynolds numbers will also be beneficial to the broader fluid mechanics community to advance understanding, modeling, and control of a wide class of vortex flow phenomena.

Currently, there is limited understanding of how humans make decisions to utilize personal and shared resources in the wake of disasters; moreover, the existing models are mostly qualitative. Limited information availability in disaster scenarios and resource uncertainty in PSSs pose two major challenges: (1) how to achieve the victims? satisfaction accounting for their risk-aware (autonomous) decision-making characteristics about dynamic resource orchestration? and (2) how to design a resilient disaster response system incentivizing the victims? participation in crowdsourcing? The innovative SOTERIA project addresses these challenges by proposing a novel behavioral decision-making model that captures humans? decision-making characteristics under risk, stemming from uncertain availability of resources. It introduces a new field in game theory, called Satisfaction Games that aims to satisfy the victims? minimum service requirements rather than maximizing their overall satisfaction, addressing the resource management problems in PSSs. A novel bio-inspired Disaster Response Network (DRN) is also proposed that mimics the inherent robustness of biological networks of living organisms, to support the victims? participation in reliable crowdsourcing, while the truthfulness and quality of the collected information are evaluated based on the newly invented Bayesian Prospect Theory. The proposed methods and the system will be evaluated using real-world field data. <br/><br/>The SOTERIA project will create new distributed control, optimization, and scalable resource management techniques in PSSs. The novelty lies in the integrated approach to efficiently managing resources considering human behavior and Tragedy of the Commons phenomena about shared resources, thus enhancing the victim?s satisfaction instead of utility maximization. To deal with incomplete information about resource availability, the proposed reinforcement learning techniques will enhance the victim?s decision-making capability in real time. Research outcomes of this project have tremendous potential for supporting ECC activities and saving peoples? lives and infrastructures during and after disasters, by designing robust situation-aware disaster response networks and advancing state of the art research in Prospect Theory, Tragedy of the Commons, and Satisfaction Games.

As thaw progresses, a well-drained landscape with a maze of tiny surface drainages may form. This dense network of small channels represents the capillaries of the Arctic hydrologic system and serves as the originators of the water that feeds large rivers. An expanding capillary hydrologic system may change habitat for wildlife due to an overall drying of the tundra landscape, increased river runoff, and through more nutrients exported from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Further, an expanding capillary hydrological network that is identifiable from sub-meter resolution satellite imagery can serve as an indicator of ice-rich permafrost thaw and, therefore, warn of hazard to infrastructure. The development and expansion of a surface drainage system may also decrease the likelihood of moss to thrive, which results in loss of a vegetation cover that effectively cools the ground and preserves the upper permafrost from thawing. The project will produce a pan-Arctic map of the capillary hydrological system and in selected areas, advance understanding of how the capillary system has changed over time. The geospatial products will be made publicly accessible on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway to enable discovery and knowledge-generation by scientists, stakeholders, and the public.<br/><br/>Field observations have shown that runoff from many Arctic rivers has increased in recent decades. Simultaneously, several studies have documented ice wedge degradation across the Arctic, and a handful of local field and remote sensing studies in Northern Alaska have shown that the capillary hydrologic system is expanding due to partial melting of ice wedges. This project aims to map the extent of the capillary hydrologic system across the pan-Arctic tundra and assess the role of the capillary system in generating water flow and lateral carbon flux to large rivers. Graph analysis techniques applied to the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon map, as well as deep learning/AI algorithms trained to detect a capillary system from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, will allow the network of ice wedges and the capillary hydrologic system to be mapped across the Arctic tundra. Field measurements in northern and northwestern Alaska will include geochemical water sampling, coring of permafrost to assess ice-wedge status (degradation or stabilization), and ground-truthing for the remote sensing hydrologic network analyses. This new information will inform a numerical hydrology model to quantify how important the capillaries are in contributing freshwater and carbon flows to the Arctic Ocean. Earlier hydrological model experiments have shown that the formation of connected troughs-networks can double the runoff from the landscape even if the rain and snowfall amounts remain unchanged. The pan-Arctic map of hydrological capillaries will support a first study on how important sub-meter wide channels are to large Arctic river runoff.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are often hypersensitive to environmental stimulation, which leads some schools for ASD children to keep windows covered to block natural light and avoid potential distractions.  Guidelines for lighting in these schools could help improve the sensory behaviors and health of children with autism.  This project will (i) discover evidence linking daylight and behavioral responses in autism educational settings, and (ii) develop and implement guidelines for inclusive indoor environments while harnessing the benefits of natural light for the children. The broader impacts of this project are: (i) to integrate knowledge from different disciplines, train cross-disciplinary students and provide a breakthrough in understanding the impact of daylight on behavioral response of ASD children; (ii) to implement findings in autism educational facilities in collaboration with local teachers and stakeholders; (iii) to create educational materials that motivate teachers, parents and caregivers to establish preventative protocols for outbursts and encourage healthy behaviors for ASD children with respect to daylight; and (iv) raise awareness in the autism community for using natural light to improve the quality of life for children with autism.<br/><br/>The project will transform the visual environment design and operation in educational environments for children with ASD. Through a pioneer framework of experimental methods, computational predictive models and evidence-based reverse engineering operation, this research will establish a new paradigm and build the foundation for a universal platform to optimally design and control daylight for this sensitive population. First, a focused experimental study will be conducted with 50 children with ASD in well-designed educational settings under real daylighting conditions. A flexible sensing network will be deployed to monitor and process pixel-wise information of dynamic luminance distributions. At the same time, seven behavioral aspects and sensory profiles will be assessed along with the children?s task performance capabilities. The data will be used in probabilistic and machine-learning-based models, to predict and classify dynamic behavioral responses to daylight-induced stimulation conditions. In turn, a generalized daylight simulation approach coupled with reverse engineering operation and optimization will translate these findings into comprehensive daylighting design and operational guidelines implemented in real autism schools in collaboration with teachers, parents and autism community stakeholders. These engineering designs are expected to refine daylighting best practices for ASD children to improve sensory behavior, minimize outbursts, and provide better everyday life for this population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events produce a weak seismic signal known as tectonic tremor. Despite their status as one of the most significant discoveries in geophysics, the physical mechanism(s) responsible for SSEs remain enigmatic, and the effects of deep slip on seismic hazards are unclear. This project explores processes that affect the strength of the fault through time, one of the factors thought to control SSEs. Areas in the Earth where SSEs occur are typically hot and under high pressure. These conditions facilitate chemical reactions, suggesting that rapidly growing minerals could act like a quick-setting glue, binding faults together through cementation, and promoting rapid fault strengthening between SSEs. To explore this possibility, the team will conduct experiments where small rock and mineral samples are subjected to the temperature and pressure conditions of SSEs. The team will then measure the material properties, such as their strength and permeability to fluids, of the experimental products as they vary with experiment duration. Using the experimental results, the team will develop a mathematical description of rapid fault healing for incorporation into numerical models exploring the influence of cementation on SSEs. Results of these simulations will be compared to real-world observations to determine whether this process plays a fundamental role in the generation of SSEs. This project will catalyze interdisciplinary research in subduction zone geoscience through the training and mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students, plus postdoctoral researchers in the fields of seismology, rock mechanics, and geochemistry. The team leaders will enable interaction between the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT) and Subduction Zones in 4 Dimensions (SZ4D) to facilitate coordination between these two efforts to achieve common goals relevant to geohazards. <br/><br/>This proposal explores the role of cohesion, which is normal stress independent fault strength, via cementation and pore fluid pressure evolution in the dynamics of SSEs. Cementation is commonly observed in exhumed faults zones and is thought to play a key role in fault healing during the interseismic period.  The high temperatures (~500°C) and pressures (1 GPa) present in SSE environs should favor relatively rapid cementation. There is also abundant evidence for fluids in the SSE source region that appear to play a crucial role in the generation of SSEs. The team proposes that pore-fluid pressure evolution and cementation can explain several enigmatic features of slow slip events, including radiative phenomena like tremor and low-frequency earthquakes, the tendency for the same section of the megathrust to re-rupture on short timescales during an SSE in so-called secondary slip fronts, the lack of sensitivity to tidally induced normal stresses, and the existence of fault strength in environments inferred to have nearly lithostatic pore fluid pressure. This work leverages interdisciplinary expertise from the fields of petrology, geochemistry, rock mechanics, observational seismology, fault mechanics, and numerical methods to explore the role of cementation and resulting cohesion in SSEs. This team will constrain the mechanisms of cementation, mineralogy and petrology of the cement, and the resulting time-dependent strengthening by performing a suite of piston-cylinder experiments at pressure, temperature, fluid compositions, and other conditions relevant for Cascadia SSEs. The project will determine the resulting cohesion and permeability using deformation experiments and contact area using microscopy. The results will provide quantitative constraints on time-dependent fault strengthening and permeability evolution. Constraints from these laboratory experiments will be used to develop a mathematical framework for cohesion and fluid flow. This framework will be implemented in numerical simulations to determine the impact of rapid cementation and cohesion on SSEs. The models will be validated with observables including propagation speeds, spatial scales, and time scales representative of SSEs and secondary fronts. This project will catalyze interdisciplinary research in subduction zone geoscience through the training and mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students, plus postdoctoral researchers in the fields of seismology, rock mechanics, and geochemistry.

Existing methods for evaluating muscle health face significant limitations, including clinical impracticality due to cumbersome procedures, reliance on highly trained personnel, high costs, and safety concerns stemming from associated pain or the use of ionizing radiation. The emergence of electrical impedance myography (EIM) offers a promising avenue for assessing muscle health. EIM is sensitive to changes in muscle structure and composition brought about by a variety of neuromuscular disorders as well as by disuse, producing unique disease signatures that will vary with muscle status. Thus, EIM analysis can provide a method to rapidly, quantitatively, and reliably diagnose and monitor neuromuscular diseases at the bedside, act as a tool to help tailor care for individual patients and streamline and improve clinical drug trials. This CAREER project integrates research with educational outreach by offering students hands-on experience in innovative translational research. This is interlaced with a long-term educational objective of mentoring new generations of students by providing them with experiences in cutting-edge research, developing and implementing activity-based style courses to motivate students? self-learning in the classroom, encouraging students to choose a science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) degree by participating in research, and assisting undergraduate students in their own translational research efforts. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will establish the scientific foundations of future generation EIM tools and enhance diagnostic accuracy by integrating artificial intelligence algorithms with simulation and analytical methods to extract quantitative muscle insights that are currently inaccessible. The tools developed and data collected are expected to lead to a deeper understanding of the role played by muscle electrical properties in EIM, understanding that is needed for the development of new and more accurate EIM tools for evaluating neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Research objectives include (1) developing a physics-informed analytical and simulation framework to model the entangled multicellular architecture underlying tissues and automate the extraction of relevant physical and biological information from EIM data, (2) assessing EIM biological variability in silico, and (3) evaluating the robustness of models generating EIM data. In silico simulations and ex vivo measurements will provide proof of principle to optimally determine the minimal yet sufficiently biophysical relevant mechanisms needed to build robust virtual EIM predictions for healthy and prototypical diseased conditions necessary to interpret EIM outcomes in patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are often hypersensitive to environmental stimulation, which leads some schools for ASD children to keep windows covered to block natural light and avoid potential distractions.  Guidelines for lighting in these schools could help improve the sensory behaviors and health of children with autism.  This project will (i) discover evidence linking daylight and behavioral responses in autism educational settings, and (ii) develop and implement guidelines for inclusive indoor environments while harnessing the benefits of natural light for the children. The broader impacts of this project are: (i) to integrate knowledge from different disciplines, train cross-disciplinary students and provide a breakthrough in understanding the impact of daylight on behavioral response of ASD children; (ii) to implement findings in autism educational facilities in collaboration with local teachers and stakeholders; (iii) to create educational materials that motivate teachers, parents and caregivers to establish preventative protocols for outbursts and encourage healthy behaviors for ASD children with respect to daylight; and (iv) raise awareness in the autism community for using natural light to improve the quality of life for children with autism.<br/><br/>The project will transform the visual environment design and operation in educational environments for children with ASD. Through a pioneer framework of experimental methods, computational predictive models and evidence-based reverse engineering operation, this research will establish a new paradigm and build the foundation for a universal platform to optimally design and control daylight for this sensitive population. First, a focused experimental study will be conducted with 50 children with ASD in well-designed educational settings under real daylighting conditions. A flexible sensing network will be deployed to monitor and process pixel-wise information of dynamic luminance distributions. At the same time, seven behavioral aspects and sensory profiles will be assessed along with the children?s task performance capabilities. The data will be used in probabilistic and machine-learning-based models, to predict and classify dynamic behavioral responses to daylight-induced stimulation conditions. In turn, a generalized daylight simulation approach coupled with reverse engineering operation and optimization will translate these findings into comprehensive daylighting design and operational guidelines implemented in real autism schools in collaboration with teachers, parents and autism community stakeholders. These engineering designs are expected to refine daylighting best practices for ASD children to improve sensory behavior, minimize outbursts, and provide better everyday life for this population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extreme heat directly impacts drinking water quality by increasing the water temperature within distribution systems. High temperatures can compromise the efficacy of disinfection against microbial pathogens by increasing the decay rates of disinfectant residuals in distribution systems. Warmer temperatures can simultaneously stimulate growth of opportunistic pathogens which can cause acute illness or death. Thus, the failure of disinfection in drinking water distribution systems during an extreme heat disaster could cause a community outbreak of illness that would further stress hospital resources and lead to loss of life. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will contribute to understanding the risk of extreme heat to the microbial and chemical safety of drinking water and help identify engineering solutions to build water system resilience. The findings will inform water utility disaster response and preparedness plans, ensuring the ability to provide clean water during extreme heat events. Findings will be communicated to utilities through stakeholder organizations and targeted outreach to at-risk water systems, such as those serving low-income communities along the Southwestern border that experience frequent extreme heat events. This project provides an enriching experience for graduate and undergraduate trainees at two diverse public universities and will introduce underrepresented students to exciting, impactful STEM research. The transfer of knowledge between two early career investigators will prime both labs for future innovations in water quality and resilience engineering.  <br/><br/>This project will evaluate the effect of extreme heat on efficacy of disinfection in drinking water distribution systems and evaluate a novel engineering solution to increase resiliency. Most disinfection studies are limited to <30 °C, which is not informative for high water temperatures possible during extreme heat events. Simulated distribution system experiments will be conducted under extreme heat conditions (35-60 °C) to elucidate disinfectant decay kinetics of conventional chlorine and chlorocyanurates, an emerging chlorine alternative recently approved for drinking water treatment. We anticipate that chlorocyanurate disinfection will be more resilient to high temperatures and maintain higher microbial protection than conventional chlorine. The growth kinetics of legionellae and the required disinfection exposure to achieve inactivation will be determined with simulated distribution system experiments under extreme heat conditions, comparing conventional chlorine and chlorocyanurate disinfection. These experiments will produce chemical kinetics and microbial inactivation models that will be combined with a heat transfer model fit to real distribution system temperatures from a Southwestern US city to quantify the anticipated disinfection failure rate under a range of extreme heat scenarios. In each scenario, the failure rate with chlorine will be compared to the proposed chlorocyanurate intervention. This project takes an interdisciplinary approach to determine the extent to which extreme heat events compromise disinfection and microbial safety in drinking water distribution systems. The integration of aquatic chemistry, microbiology, and thermodynamics will produce holistic understanding of disinfection efficacy under extreme heat conditions. Bacterial inactivation results will provide critical insights into the persistence of this dangerous pathogen in drinking water distribution systems under extreme heat. This work will advance scientific understanding of how to mitigate health risk in US drinking water systems increasingly subjected to extreme heat.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the NSF CMMI Disaster Resilience Research Grants and CBET Environmental Engineering Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects to intentionally infiltrate water into underground formations (aquifers), a strategy called managed aquifer recharge (MAR), are getting traction as an alternative to surface reservoirs, because they can provide long-term water storage and water resilience to groundwater-dependent communities. Properly implemented, MAR can enhance communities? access to safe and reliable drinking water, lower costs, reduce flood risks, and provide ecosystem benefits. However, the development of infrastructure projects by highly fragmented water management institutions has often excluded historically marginalized communities from decision-making, resulting in inequitable and contested outcomes. This project?s goal is to analyze the role of decentralized investment partnerships in developing aquifer storage infrastructure that promotes economic productivity and environmental benefits, while enhancing community access to safe and reliable drinking water under a changing climate. The results will be presented to communities, water suppliers and state decision makers to evaluate and model political responses and improve the overall societal outcomes. The resulting decision-making framework for MAR development, accounting for political feedbacks, will provide useful direction to regions throughout the Western U.S. and beyond.<br/><br/>The project will generate a better understanding of the socio-environmental systems surrounding water management in agriculture-intensive regions.

The research will clarify how decentralized investment partnerships can promote economic productivity and environmental benefits, while enhancing community access to safe and reliable drinking water under a changing climate. The research will integrate political and institutional feedbacks into simulation-based water resources models that can inform decision making in the challenging context of western U.S. water management. The project will use a co-production framework that involves collaborating with fourteen cooperating partners representing a diverse array of stakeholders, to advance theory and produce actionable results related to: water portfolio design, collaboration risk in large-scale infrastructure partnerships, multi-objective assessment of MAR benefits under uncertainty, and political advocacy by historically disadvantaged communities during periods of institutional development and change.

A fundamental control on the rate of ice loss is how fast ice flows from ice sheet interiors out to the edges.  In the interior of the Greenland Ice Sheet, ice flow responds to liquid water (?runoff"") input, which affects how the ice slides over the bedrock beneath.  At ocean-terminating ""outlet glaciers? around the edges of Greenland, ice flows into the ocean with speed that varies by season.  That strong seasonal variation makes it more difficult to determine the extent to which liquid water input is affecting the flow speed.  Identifying the relative strength of ocean-driven versus melt-driven ice flow variations is essential for computer models used to forecast future ice loss.  It has been difficult to assess those factors in a consistent way because they operate over multiple time scales, thus requiring different methods of observation that could not be directly compared.<br/><br/>This proposal seeks to address three key motivating questions: (Q1) How does runoff affect outlet glacier flow over timescales of hours to years?; (Q2) How does glacier geometry affect the response to runoff?; and (Q3) How do runoff- and terminus-driven velocity variations interact? To address these questions, the PIs will combine new field observations at a large marine-terminating outlet glacier with newly available satellite data from multiple sources, using recently developed methods for flexible time series analysis.  Multivariate statistical analysis and idealized numerical model experiments will test hypothesized feedbacks between runoff-driven and terminus-driven changes, as well as connect the observational work to more general settings.  The PIs will develop open-source software that allows other researchers to replicate their analysis for remote-sensing and in situ data obtained on any glacier.

The aim of this project is to investigate how novel QC methodologies can be used to solve problems in PSE. The successful completion of the project will showcase the possibility of quantum computers eventually outperforming classical computers in solving complex decision-making problems in PSE. Such an achievement would have far-reaching implications for other sub-fields within engineering, such as supply chain management, signal processing, machine learning, and operations research. Additionally, this project will contribute to expanding the QC workforce to include much needed experts in QC with backgrounds in chemical engineering and operations research.<br/><br/>The objectives of this proposal are three-fold.  First, while most of the optimization-oriented QC research is dedicated to the solution of optimization problems with only discrete-choice decision variables, this project will first focus on deriving and analyzing quantum optimization techniques for problems with continuous choice decision variables.  Second, akin to what has been successful in classical optimization, this research aims to use these quantum continuous optimization techniques as the fundamental block to address the solution of specially structured mixed optimization problems arising in process systems engineering (PSE). The hybrid combination of strengths from both QC and classical hardware will be key for the successful implementation of the proposed approach. Third, the investigators aim to tailor and evaluate the performance of the derived quantum optimization techniques on mixed-integer optimization problems arising in PSE, particularly those arising from a structured approach to modeling interconnections between the array of process operations. To accomplish these three objectives, researchers will address the fundamental problem of building a complexity and performance framework for quantum algorithms for the solution of continuous optimization problems, aiming to characterize and analyze their performance not only in theory, but also in computational practice. In addition to designing and analyzing hybrid quantum algorithms, researchers will develop specialized software and numerical techniques to test the derived strategies and obtain crucial feedback for computationally effective algorithmic design.  The successful completion of the proposal?s objectives will lead to a better understanding of the potential of QC to help in the solution of application-relevant mathematical problems and have a direct impact on the capacity of quantum computers to outperform classical computers in the solution of complex decision-making problems in PSE and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of the existing head-based sensing and stimulation methods are cumbersome, intrusive, and expensive, mostly suitable only for stationary and short-term usages such as in clinics or hospitals. This project aims to fill that gap by enabling a novel form of wearable sensing and actuating systems that can unobtrusively, continuously, comfortably, and simultaneously sense a multitude of head-based physiological signals and actuate to stimulate the brain while remaining minimally visible to the public. While the well-accepted form factors for wearable devices are watches, glasses, and other kinds of body-worn form factors, this work takes a drastically different approach, an ear-worn sensing and actuation approach (called Earable Systems) to tame a problem that has long hindered the deployment of head-based wearable systems, namely user acceptance, by making the wearable devices more socially acceptable and less visible to the public. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the key research activities. The activities include: formulating multiple head-based signal propagation models to and from human ears using superposition principle of wave propagation; developing algorithms, experimental hardware blocks, analytical models, and software libraries for sensing individual head-based physiological signals; developing closed-loop stimulation techniques, associated hardware, analytical tools, and safety guidelines for effective and safe just-in-time brain stimulation from the ears; and evaluating Earable Systems and the proposed platform in-lab for a compelling and practical application. <br/><br/>This project's broader impacts stem from an integrated program of education, research and outreach that will translate the research results into demonstrations and hands-on experiences for under-served middle school students and local teachers through lab visits and summer workshops.

A significant focus of this project is creating a STEM network between minority-serving institutions and community colleges to foster collaborations and build capacity, training and mentoring 24 students in 4-year university and 2-year community colleges annually, providing them with interdisciplinary skills such as UAV piloting, GIS, coastal science, and scientific communication.

However, seagrass conditions are rarely quantified in spatial and temporal domains, and traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, expensive, or have a coarse resolution. UAV imaging combined with GIS are emerging technologies for monitoring coastal seagrass ecosystems because of their spatial high-resolution, temporal flexibility, and cost-efficiency. Our project utilizes multi-platform UAV systems with visible, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors to provide more accurate data for better delineation and classification of seagrass and predicting disease more effectively. Combined with ground data and in situ sampling, we develop a UAV and GIS-based platform for comprehensive monitoring of seagrass ecosystems. The platform aid in the detection of diseases at an individual leaf scale in prominent seagrass habitats. Our research includes multi-platform UAV mapping, spatial modeling of the seagrass disease, temporal analysis of seagrass bed extent changes, development of AI-based image analysis for species classification and disease detection, creation of a cloud data hub for real-time data exchange, and provision of research training and professional development opportunities for students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased erosion and sediment yield from these events is likely to damage soils, clog rivers, and cripple hydraulic infrastructure. However, we have little information on the magnitude of the response of our rivers and landscapes to global climate change because these changes occur on timescales difficult to measure in our lifetimes. Therefore, we must look to times in Earth?s past when temperatures and atmospheric CO¬2 concentrations rose rapidly to study landscape response. During the early Eocene, approximately 56 to 52 million years ago, there were repeated intervals known as hyperthermal events where global temperatures rapidly increased due to releases of CO2 over a period of ~20,000 years. These hyperthermals provide one of the best analogs to modern anthropogenic climate change, albeit at a slower rate than today. This project will focus on improving scientific and public understanding of how future climate change will affect our river systems by using analogs from the early Eocene in New Mexico, Wyoming, and North Dakota. The education plan will target a diverse population of students from the University of Houston that will strengthen undergraduate exposure to field geology using virtual field trips. Because climate change can be an abstract and intimidating concept for some groups, collaborations with a world-renowned climate-artist will be used to break down mental barriers and communicate science to the public and low-income and minority students from the Houston area. <br/><br/>This project will generate new terrestrial paleoclimate records from three fluvially dominated basins in the western US: 1) San Juan Basin of New Mexico, 2) Wind River Basin of Wyoming, and 3) Williston Basin of North Dakota.

This project will use a multi-proxy approach that includes geochemistry, mineralogy, stable isotopes (?13C, ?18O, and ?47), sedimentology, stratigraphy, radiogenic isotope geochronology (40Ar/39Ar, U-Th-Pb), and magnetostratigraphy to reconstruct the paleoclimate and constrain landscape response to the hyperthermal events both spatially and temporally. The resulting dataset will be integrated into quantitative models to test how rapid atmospheric CO2 increases, global warming, and the resulting hydrologic cycle intensification will increase the magnitude of weathering and sediment yield, which has the potential to cause billions of dollars in damage to infrastructure and ecosystems from soil loss, erosion, and increased flooding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the major reasons for these increased demands is the generation of non-utilized waste streams. The U.S. generates approximately 254 million tons of trash each year, with only 34% of this waste recycled or composted.  Increasing restrictions on the export of garbage has generated both challenges and opportunities for the management of waste systems. Waste material provides and opportunity for materials recovery, the generation of new products and processes, and the potential to positively impact food, energy, and water systems.  Given the increasing rates of consumption internationally, developing the next generation of waste recovery is of global significance.  However, reinventing waste streams requires a better understanding of how waste is currently governed, rethinking and redesigning waste recovery production systems to better capture the value of material, developing systems for monitoring material composition, integration with new cyber infrastructure for waste monitoring, and incorporating the behavioral and policy structures that influence action across complex multi-scaled systems.  The objectives of the project are to develop a systems-level framework for comparative analysis of organic waste lifecycles that combines behavior sciences with material flows analysis to rethink waste systems and the development of new co-products from organic wastes. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on systems-level interactions in the framework of ""Organic Waste Lifecycles at the Interface of Food, Energy and Water Systems (OWL-FEWs)."" The project entails the development of the next generation of cyber-infrastructure for measuring, monitoring, and capturing data on organic waste streams; analysis of social and institutional drivers behind organic waste disposal behavior; and experimentation, development, and testing of new co-products from organic waste streams. Utilizing an existing pilot-scale anaerobic digester, bio/hydrochar engineering facilities, open source radio frequency identification tagging for real time tracking of waste flows, and a series of behavior experiments and comparative institutional analysis of human behavior, the research team will focus on five goals: 1) The development of a dynamic model of organic waste lifecycles at a regional level; 2) The development and testing of organic food waste co-products for energy, soil amendments, water remediation, and other uses; 3) The development of a smart organic food waste cyber infrastructure; 4) The integration of social sciences across the development of the dynamic model, cyberinfrastructure, and waste/resource products; and 5) The engagement of stakeholders across the research and educational efforts. The results of this research will provide meaningful pathways to reducing waste in the U.S. and provide water treatment, energy, and agricultural resources from waste, leading to better food, energy, and water security in the U.S.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nation's economic prosperity depends more and more on cultivating a well-educated, diverse STEM workforce and a scientifically literate public. Yet less than 20% of bachelor's degrees are awarded in STEM fields. Non-STEM majors often take general education (GE) courses aimed at increasing the appreciation of STEM rather than teaching specific STEM knowledge and skills. These courses often leave out the inquiry-based approaches and experimental investigations that are important for developing STEM knowledge and skills. However, with recent advances in common technologies, it is possible to couple mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) with findings from education research about how students learn best, to provide both rich content and inquiry-based learning experiences for non-STEM majors. This project will pursue one example of that integration. Namely, the investigators will use mobile technology and research-based educational strategies to teach the physics of waves and quantum physics in a GE course on the Physics of Music, which uses the concepts found in music to teach quantum physics. Familiarity with the physics of waves and quantum physics is useful to students who pursue a variety of career paths.<br/><br/>New, emerging technologies based on the principles of quantum physics are currently being developed and have the potential to revolutionize computing, information science, data security, high-speed communications, and navigation. It is important for students to develop a basic understanding of these principles. Mobile devices with multiple built-in sensors have the potential to deliver low-cost, high-quality educational content that allows users not only to learn about the world around them but also to interact with it. New educational approaches in physics, such as the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) approach, increase students' learning by having students discover physical principles the way a physicist does -- through hands-on, interactive experiences. The investigators will research and develop an interactive mobile application that integrates data acquisition tools, an e-text, e-learning modules, and the ISLE approach in a GE course to teach quantum physics through a topic of general interest, the physics of music. Both the physics of music and quantum physics are the physics of waves. Thus, students will learn the most important subject in modern physics through the underlying principles of music. The investigators aim to determine whether this method increases students' learning, critical thinking, scientific reasoning skills, and scientific literacy. This research has the potential to extend new learning tools beyond a traditional physics classroom setting, enabling high-quality physics education for larger audiences. The project will result in a new mobile app that contains an e-text and e-learning modules that can be implemented in a variety of educational settings.

A good engineer must know how technology works but even more importantly, how technology might affect people and society. This means that engineering faculty need to prepare their students for working well with others and to respect their ideas. In order for engineering faculty to know how to best help their students, this project will conduct this research study to explore what engineering students believe about non-engineers when they are working together to solve problems in a community. This will be accomplished by 1) investigating different ways of determining what engineering students believe about those who are not engineers, 2) grouping students? beliefs into categories that allow exploration of trends, and 3) working together with a team of students, community partners, and teachers to brainstorm ideas on how students can learn more about themselves. This will help make future professional engineers better, by showing students the importance of treating those who are not engineers with respect and valuing their ideas. The goal of this research study is to make sure that members of society do not experience negative impacts because of what engineers think or believe. The intent is to ensure that the work engineers do to help society is not unintentionally hurting communities or treating people who are different from them unfairly. This research will help engineering faculty learn more about what their students believe about non-engineers, which can help them teach in a way that truly makes engineering work benefit all of society by improving the way engineers solve problems.<br/><br/>Since the professional socialization of engineering students commonly fosters the belief that engineers? scientific approaches to problem solving are superior to other ways of thinking, it is important that engineering education provides students with explicit opportunities to reflect on, and learn to be critical of, such beliefs, a process known as reflexivity. This research will produce new knowledge on qualitative methods for effectively accessing implicit beliefs in engineering education. Service-learning in engineering provides an educational context to investigate this phenomenon as it explicitly positions students to engage with others in socio-technical contexts. With an overarching goal of fostering egalitarian beliefs about the value of diverse perspectives in all engineering students, this project will investigate the context of service-learning. Within this context, this project will produce knowledge that enables engineering educators and other researchers, both in and out of service-learning contexts, to access important constructs of professional formation through the contribution of a nuanced characterization of the beliefs held by engineering students. Our analysis will reveal the beliefs for engineering students that are both 1) commonly held, and 2) varied, enabling the identification of beliefs that exist at a broad, cultural level in engineering as well as beliefs that can be understood as implicit outcomes of students? lived experiences. Lastly, the collaborative inquiry component of this project will produce recommendations for how these implicit belief patterns can be used as inputs for enhancing service-learning. This is a meaningful contribution in that it can inform the programmatic implementation of service-learning experiences and serve as evidence for the development of instructional tools that support enhancing service-learning curricula through promoting reflexivity in engineering students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When conditions become too stressful on reefs, corals can lose beneficial microbial symbionts (e.g., dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae) that live in their tissues via a process called ?bleaching?. Although Symbiodiniaceae play key roles in the health of coral colonies, we know little about the processes that make symbionts available in the environment to prospective host corals. This research tests the extent to which the feces of coral-eating fish, which contain live Symbiodiniaceae, facilitate symbiont acquisition by corals in their early life stages. It will generate seminal knowledge on how corallivore feces impact coral symbioses and health, and will assess the ecological importance of corallivorous fishes as drivers of coral symbiont assemblages. This research also test the extent to which corallivore feces are a source of food and nutrients that impact coral health; this has particular relevance to the survival and recovery of bleached adult corals. This research can ultimately inform intervention strategies to support reef resilience and mitigate reef degradation. Results from this project will be communicated widely in scientific arenas, in undergraduate education programs, and to the public via multimedia content and outreach. The Houston Independent School District (HISD, Houston, TX) is the nation?s 7th largest public school system. This work will also support economically disadvantaged and first-generation undergraduate students in pursuing STEM majors and careers through multi-year research experiences.<br/><br/>Symbioses between foundation species (e.g., corals, sponges, trees) and microbiota (e.g., microeukaryotes, bacteria) underpin the biodiversity, productivity, and stability of ecosystems. Consumers, such as predators and herbivores, shape communities of these foundation species through trophic interactions. For instance, grazers contribute to the maintenance of coral dominance on reefs via consumption of macroalgal competitors. However, the indirect effects of other consumers on foundation species are rarely examined. Few studies have tested how consumers affect microbiota assembly in corals, even though coral symbionts (e.g., dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae) play key roles in reef function and persistence. Corallivorous (coral-eating) fishes were recently demonstrated to egest large quantities of live Symbiodiniaceae cells as they swim across reefs. This research is testing the hypothesis that corallivore feces promote coral dominance on reefs by supporting coral acquisition of key symbionts and nutrients. The following research objectives will be accomplished: (1) to quantify the contribution of corallivorous fish feces to coral symbiont acquisition; and (2) to test the extent to which corallivorous fish feces influence coral health and recovery from thermal stress. Reefs are being degraded globally due to climate-change induced bleaching and associated mortality. This project is teasing apart the extent to which nutrients and/or live symbionts associated with corallivore feces contribute to the resilience of bleached corals under ambient and heat stress conditions. The research is tightly integrated with two education objectives: (1) to organize a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program in which rigorous learning modules that high school teachers can incorporate into their Environmental Systems course offerings are developed and tested; and (2) to provide undergraduate students with a multi-year research experience through a partnership with the Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scientific results will be disseminated in the form of articles in technical journals, conference presentations, and university seminars.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The goal of this program is to demonstrate E-mode ?-Ga2O3 fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) with breakdown voltages beyond 3kV, specific on-resistance lower than 1 milli-ohm-cm-square switching efficiency higher than 98% at 15kHz frequency. The scientific goals of this CAREER plan are (i) A thorough investigation and experimentation into the impact of slanted-sidewall and N implantation in the inter-fin areas on electric fields to enhance breakdown voltage. (ii) Fabrication and characterization of FinFETs on both metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown and halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE)-grown epi-structure to analyze and compare the impact of growth technique, and material quality on device performance. This study assists in selecting the appropriate growth technique for each process module in the future. (iii) A systematic study of the substrate thickness impact on device characteristics such as Ron. (iv) Development of ?-(Al,Ga)2O3 regrowth on the fin sidewalls by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) and a complete investigation of the impact of regrowth conditions on electron mobility in the channel, interface trap density, and FinFET characteristics. This will be the first demonstration of sidewall regrowth in this material system. (v) Development of robust and reliable Hf(Si)O2 dielectrics by PAMBE as well as investigation and analysis of deposition conditions on dielectric quality (breakdown, dielectric constant, leakage, etc.). This will be the first demonstration of in-situ dielectric deposition in this material system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need to advance climate science is urgent and escalating. Improving public action on, public support of, and decision making based on climate science improves if and how we respond to climate challenges. This research explores how to create enduring change in public behavior to support effective action to address climate impacts on society. Despite four decades of climate science communication, we continue to seek adequate public and decision maker action and decision maker support to substantively address climate challenges. This research focuses on positive self-efficacy frames (when a person feels empowered to take action and make an impact) that have been shown to generate engagement and support for climate science yet have been largely absent from mainstream dialogue. Specifically, it focuses on moral, ethical, and spiritual concerns, which though underrepresented have proven to have powerful sway over individual attitudes and behaviors. The findings of the three studies comprising this project and their outreach components (multimedia content, white papers, videos, a website) can empower decision makers, business leaders, and other relevant leaders and stakeholders to make more informed decisions through targeted interventions. <br/><br/>This project has three studies that extend over three years. Each study focuses on a different area that has shown promise for generating enduring change in environmental behavior. The first study, entitled ?Promoting Self-Reflection,? covers deep engagement. Past research shows that if a person engages in active thinking on an issue, they are more likely to develop enduring attitudinal change. This research follows 90 participants based on three different moral, ethical, or spiritual interventions to support active thinking while applying periodic surveys to measure progress. The second study, ?Retelling the Story,? looks at mental models. Mental models are our internal schema that influence how we respond to new situations. This study includes 150 participants? responses to different environmental multimedia interventions based on moral, ethical, or spiritual narratives using surveys and a digital mental modeling tool. The third study, ?Building Infectious Behaviors,? addresses social norms, which are powerful cycles of collective behavior. This study includes 120 participants and their practice of environmental self-generative norms informed by moral, ethical or spiritual positions and includes surveys, written reflections and regular logging.<br/><br/>This research is supported by the Science of Science: Discovery, Communication and Impact program and the Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences Office of the Assistant Director.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems power a variety of embedded and IoT devices, such as sensors, medical devices, wearables, smart family gadgets, industrial computing units, autonomous vehicles, and infotainment systems. While the benefits of these systems are unparalleled, they are susceptible to cyberattacks, which are occurring at unprecedented levels and often have severe consequences ranging from loss of life to homeland security breaches. To ensure our IoT infrastructure and ecosystem are built on a trustworthy and secure foundation, this project's novelties are to expand knowledge in pursuit of trustworthy and deployable solutions encompassing the hardware and software layers of computer systems. The project's broader significance and importance, beyond securing the IoT infrastructure, are to train the next generation of cybersecurity researchers, educators, and practitioners with deep theoretical understandings and practical skills in this field.<br/><br/>Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), an enabling technology for the confidential computing paradigm, are offered in Central Processing Units (CPUs) as a foundational primitive for security to keep code and data loaded inside computer systems protected. The hardware and software layers of existing TEEs nevertheless have been criticized for lack of transparency and presence of vulnerabilities. This project studies a systematic research approach to increase the trustworthiness and deployability of TEEs and TEE-based security solutions for embedded and IoT devices. Specifically, the project advances the frontiers of knowledge in (1) designing trustworthy TEE hardware paradigms with a minimal Trusting Computing Base (TCB); (2) discovering and fixing confused deputy vulnerabilities of TEE software; and (3) developing new security solutions that utilize TEEs and other hardware units for better protection and superior performance. The education thrust advances the state of knowledge in IoT software and system security education pedagogy and platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
