This challenging regime has many open questions of relevance for a new generation of experiments and quantum devices. The PI and her research team will study how such systems evolve in time, whether their collective temporal behavior can show some system-independent universal properties, and under what conditions traces of their initial state disappear completely. The projects will bring together concepts from diverse fields of physics.<br/><br/>The award has a strong educational component that involves the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral research scientist. The results of the projects will be presented at workshops and conferences, and will be incorporated in a review article in a journal widely read by the community. The project will lead to the development of new theoretical approaches to study the dynamics of complex systems, and will address fundamental questions of relevance to quantum information and quantum computing. The PI will also participate in outreach activities that are part of a continuing partnership between the NYU physics department and local schools.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The award supports research and education on nonequilibrium phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems. The focus will be to study quench dynamics in closed and open quantum systems with applications to cold-atomic gases, ultra-fast pump-probe spectroscopy of solid-state systems, and light-matter coupled systems.<br/><br/>The project has several components:<br/><br/>a) The research team will build on their recent work where universal aging behavior was found after a quantum quench to the critical point of an isolated bosonic O(N) model, and explore similar universality in other kinds of bosonic and fermionic models. Large-N and dimensional expansions methods will be used to study the time-evolution, and to identify scaling behavior at intermediate times, as well as light-cone dynamics.<br/><br/>b) The research team will also study the dynamics of entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench. This study will be carried out for quenches to the critical point, as well as for interacting one-dimensional systems with strong disorder.<br/><br/>c) The research team has access to some exact results for the quench dynamics coming from the large-N limit of interacting field theories. These exact results will be used as a benchmark for developing time-dependent variational methods based on tensor network states.<br/><br/>The goal of the projects will be to obtain general results not only on universal dynamics after a quantum quench, but also on the dynamics of entanglement entropy and entanglement spectra. Thus, results will be obtained on how fast information travels after a quantum quench, and how this depends on how excited the system is, its dimensionality, proximity to a critical point, range of interactions, and how ergodic the system is. The project will also result in the development of  new methods to study nonequilibrium quantum systems.<br/><br/>The award has a strong educational component that involves the active participation of graduate, undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral research scientist. The results of the projects will be presented at workshops and conferences, and will be incorporated in a review article on quantum quenches. The award will lead to the development of new theoretical approaches to study nonequilibrium phenomena. Moreover the PI's study of entanglement dynamics will address fundamental questions of relevance to quantum information and quantum computing. In addition, the PI will participate in outreach activities that are part of a continuing partnership between the NYU physics department and local schools."

Dumas will undertake computational simulations of ""flyby encounters"" between galaxies, which are interactions that affect galaxies as they move past each other. Unlike direct mergers in which two galaxies combine to form one galaxy, flyby encounters are poorly understood, and are also calculated to be surprisingly frequent. A more detailed understanding of flyby encounters is thus essential to advancing our understanding of how galaxies are assembled. Dumas will also develop a series of workshops for the participants of a program that serves underrepresented minority students, which will help the students acquire and strengthen the skills needed to undertake challenging computational research in graduate school.<br/><br/>Dumas will construct a suite of collisionless and hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the perturbation induced by flyby encounters as a function of mass ratio, impact parameter, and relative velocity, which would allow her to track bulk changes in galaxy structure, kinematics, and morphology over a broad flyby interaction space. The proposed studies would allow Dumas to identify the flybys that are the most important drivers of galaxy evolution. The educational component of Dumas' work will consist of developing an intensive Computational Bootcamp workshop series for incoming graduate students within the Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge program. The Bootcamp will cover a variety of topics on basic programming, and will be geared toward strengthening the computational skillset and understanding of the students to better prepare them for advanced computational research."

The objective is to strengthen law and social science scholarship generally and especially that of U.S. scholars by connecting them with theoretical, methodological, and policy discussions taking place among law and social science researchers in other parts of the world. Transnational problems, such as terrorism, human trafficking, pandemics, immigration, international finance and trade, gender inequality, and natural resource governance, require responses that take into account the legal institutions and practices of many different countries.  Cross-disciplinary and cross-national teams will advance science and help diversify the scientific workforce by bringing wider perspectives to the problems they address. By facilitating international exchange in the area of socio-legal research, US scholars can expand their own perspectives, which will also help their work on domestic US problems. US scholars can also, in partnership with their peers in other countries, make greater contributions to public policy and practice on a global scale. Nation-states in war-torn or less affluent regions of the world may be better able to find their own solutions as well as to cooperate more effectively with external aid agencies and foreign governments when their own scholars are well equipped to advise policy-makers, and when the governments can draw upon international scholarly networks for their own institution building. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project supports the work of cross-national and cross-disciplinary International Research Collaboratives (IRCs), research groups that incorporate global perspectives on important law and social science problems. The research groups will meet at a joint international conference in Mexico City in 2017 of the Law and Society Association and the Research Committee on the Sociology of Law. The grant funds are used to enable scholars from low and middle income countries to participate in the research activities of the IRCs. The IRC model builds on past research collaborations supported by the National Science Foundation, collaborations that have produced many important theoretical and applied discoveries. The objective of the collaboratives is to strengthen law and social science scholarship of U.S. scholars by connecting them with theoretical, methodological, and policy discussions taking place among law and social science researchers in other parts of the world. Transnational problems, such as terrorism, human trafficking, pandemics, immigration, international finance and trade, gender inequality, and natural resource governance, require responses that take into account the legal institutions and practices of many different countries. The cross-disciplinary and cross-national teams will bring wider theoretical perspectives to the problems they address. The IRCs generate new knowledge about the most effective research methods for analyzing global law and social science phenomena."

Salvesen will perform advanced numerical simulations to understand how strong magnetic fields influence black hole X-ray Binaries (BH XRBs), which consist of a black hole feeding on a disk of X-ray emitting gas from a companion star. Understanding BH XRBs is key to learning about other types of black holes as well. The center of nearly every galaxy (including our own)  hosts a supermassive black hole surrounded by a disk of gas, but supermassive black holes are very difficult to understand because they change very little over our lifetimes. Because BH XRBs are thought to be scaled down versions of supermassive black holes, and exhibit changes on timescales accessible to astronomers, they are ideal laboratories for studying how material accretes around a black hole. Alongside this work, Salvesen will create a website featuring real astronomical data that have been converted into sound samples, and he will develop workshops to convey classroom  astronomy concepts through sound to K-12 students with visual impairments or limited English proficiency.<br/><br/>Salvesen will undertake numerical simulations of strongly magnetized accretion disks to calculate two direct observable quantities of BH XRBs: (1) the spectrum of light emitted by an accretion disk subjected to magnetic fields of various strengths and geometries, as well as quasi-periodic oscillations produced by accretion disk variability; and (2) the spectrum of light absorbed by magnetically driven disk winds, and manifested in diagnostic probes (e.g., spectral lines of highly ionized atoms). Salvesen will then compare the simulations with the observed properties of BH-XRBs to determine if the emission and absorption spectra of these objects can be used to understand the influence of strong magnetic fields on black hole accretion disks. Salvesen will also create the Astronomy Sound of the Month (ASOM) website and develop ""sonification"" workshops to convey basic astronomy concepts to visually impaired or English-language learning K-12 students."

In addition to instrument development, Ruane will lead a program within the Pasadena Unified School District designed to encourage interest in science and engineering in a diverse population of students from historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The detection of biosignatures in the spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet requires instruments that can discriminate light from a host star many magnitudes brighter than the exoplanet, over a large spectral bandwidth, coupled with high throughput from the off-axis planet. With the construction of larger telescopes, the newer structures in the telescope apertures introduce diffraction of the brighter starlight, complicating the existing mechanisms used for starlight suppression. Ruane has designed new types of optical components that are optimized for large, obstructed, potentially segmented telescope apertures similar to those planned for ground-based and space-based telescopes. These designs will be refined and tested both in laboratories at Caltech and JPL, and on sky at the Palomar and Keck Observatories.

Graur's research seeks to transform large spectroscopic survey observations into searches for transient events (transients), such as supernova explosions and the disruption of stars by black holes, that are thought to be important in the lifecycles of stars and galaxies. Graur will study two types of transients: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), which are supernovae occurring in two stars orbiting one another; and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE), which are bright flares produced when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy disrupts the material from a nearby star. Few SNe Ia and TDEs have been observed to date, however, and Graur's work has the potential to drastically increase the detections of SNe Ia and TDEs, allowing astronomers to study these transients in a statistical manner. Graur will also build a mentoring program in which postdoctoral scholars and graduate students will supervise high school students in advanced scientific research projects. <br/><br/>Graur will enhance his supernova detection code to enable detection of all types of transients in large scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys, starting with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will integrate the enhanced code into the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey. The focus of his research will be to enlarge the number of SNe Ia and TDE detections to make statistical analyses of these events possible. Assembling a statistical sample of SNe Ia would allow measurement of SNe Ia rates as a function of galaxy stellar mass, thereby improving constraints on the nature of SNe Ia progenitors. Similarly, enlarging the number of TDE detections through dedicated surveys would allow a better understanding of the behavior of TDEs, and stellar parameters inferred from the TDE emission would provide a novel method to measure SMBH masses and mass distributions. For the educational component of his work, Graur will develop a research mentoring program called SRMP@Harvard, in which about 15 postdoctoral scholars and advanced graduate students will supervise about 50 high school students from the Cambridge and Boston areas in active scientific research."

Often, the most effective method to solve a problem is to create a mathematical model. Frequently, such models involve unknown parameters related by several equations that are often impossible to solve exactly. Commutative algebra is the qualitative study of such systems of polynomial equations. Its applications are far-reaching and include diverse fields such as computer science, cryptography, coding theory, robotics, pattern recognition, and theoretical physics. One can study the sets of solutions of these systems either geometrically or algebraically. This project deals with the algebraic approach. One of the goals of the project is to understand the smallest number of equations needed to describe a geometric object like a curve or surface. Another is to construct the system of equations defining a given geometric object. A third goal is the study of the relations among a given set of polynomial equations, the relations among the relations, and so on. The project involves undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the research. <br/><br/>This research project has three main themes. The first is to develop criteria for a variety in projective space to be a set-theoretic complete intersection. A fundamental tool to solve this problem is the theory of local cohomology modules. Local cohomology modules encode the algebraic and topological structure of an algebraic variety. As modules over the ring, local cohomology modules are huge (neither finitely generated nor Artinian), hence intractable. However, as modules over the Weil algebra they can be filtered by simple objects and become manageable. Hence an important task is to understand the D-module structure of local cohomology modules. The second theme is the study of local rings using the notion of distance. This notion was introduced in recent work of the investigator and collaborators to understand the integral closure of ideals. The idea is to use distance as a substitute for shifts in homogeneous resolutions and for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of graded modules. The main goal is to prove general results that are inspired by statements in the graded case. The last theme is to study the implicit equations defining the graph and the image of rational maps between projective spaces. This is a classical problem in elimination theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry with applications, for instance, in geometric modeling."

By studying the paleoecology of disturbance regimes from a historical context, the investigator will provide new insights into the stability of a pristine rainforest.  The investigator's analyses of the spatio-temporal patterns of fire across multiple habitat types will transform basic understanding of distinguishing climate-induced fire impacts versus those that were human-induced.  The project will address fundamental questions of fire ecology and landscape disturbance in a highly biodiverse ecosystem.  The project will have a strong focus on educational and research capacity-building in the study region.  It will foster collaboration across U.S. and foreign organizations, and it will provide a strong foundation for interdisciplinary education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.  Project results will promote collaborative ties among national and international partners to increase their capabilities to address issues related to tropical forest stewardship across many parts of the Earth.<br/><br/>Soil charcoal records provide insight into the potentially important role of fire in the ecology of rainforests affected by episodic droughts.  This project will focus on four core questions:  (1) How prevalent was fire during the Holocene and earlier periods?  (2) Is the spatial pattern of fire consistent with climatic control or with agricultural activities associated with shifting cultivation? (3) What is the quantity of pyrogenic organic matter in soils among different habitats, and how well is such charcoal preserved in tropical soils?  (4) What is the history of peat accumulation in the forest over the past 6,000 years, and has it been affected by past fire events and environmental change?  A total of 126 sampling sites will be established across seven habitat types in a study region in Indonesian Borneo, and the investigators will examine these for direct evidence of past fires from radiocarbon-dated charcoal particles in soil.  Sampling data will be spectrally, chemically, and quantitatively analyzed to determine the chronological pattern of changing fire over time.  The data and methods developed from this research project will have global implications for studying fire behavior studies across a wide-range of diverse ecosystems."

In recent years, this targeted killing capacity has emerged as a core component of several promising immunotherapeutic strategies to fight cancer. A better understanding of how cytotoxic T cells operate is therefore not only of biological interest but also of potential clinical relevance. T cells kill by first forming a close cell-cell interface, called an immunological synapse, with their targets.  They then secrete a mixture of toxic proteins into the synapse, which damage the target's plasma membrane and intracellular contents. Recent biophysical studies have indicated that T cells exert a substantial amount of mechanical force across the synapse, which could potentially alter the shape and physical properties of the target cell. The experiments in this research will investigate the hypothesis that these forces boost killing by enhancing the activity of the toxic proteins secreted into the synapse. The idea that mechanical force and chemical signals cooperate in this manner is quite unappreciated and could represent an important new concept in the understanding of intercellular communication and immune function.  The principal investigator will also develop a paid summer internship program in mechanobiology targeting female students at both the high school and university levels to provide them an entryway into a research career.<br/><br/>The studies will focus on potential synergy between synaptic forces and the secreted cytolytic molecule perforin, which forms proteinaceous pores on the target cell membrane.  Preliminary results suggest that synapse formation increases target cell membrane tension, thereby potentiating perforin pore formation. Biophysical methods will be merged with immunological assays in order to investigate this hypothesis. Polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates will be used to explore the relationship between target cell tension and perforin pore formation. Optical trap methodology will be used to quantify the effects of synapse formation on membrane tension. Finally, polydimethylsiloxine micropillar arrays will be used to examine the spatiotemporal coordination of force exertion and perforin secretion. The successful completion of these research goals could establish mechanopotentiation (i.e. the synergy between physical and chemical signals) as an important avenue for intercellular communication, which would broadly influence current conceptions and future studies of cell-cell interactions and mechanobiology."

Hybrid app frameworks allow mobile developers to design app code using web technologies alone, and supply native and bridge code (APIs for accessing device resources) necessary for instant porting to several mobile platforms.<br/><br/>This research will develop techniques to mitigate critical security and privacy vulnerabilities in hybrid app frameworks, by creating an airtight security model robust against bridge exploits, and minimizing the overall attack surface of the hybrid framework. In a global society increasingly reliant on mobile technology, mobile app security constitutes a pressing responsibility, and impacts several sections of society, including children. This project will provide a significant contribution towards meeting this challenge. Case studies, practical examples, and research experience gained from this project will be integrated into graduate-level courses, especially Master's and certificate programs in cyber-security. Additionally, interesting techniques and examples developed in this project will be incorporated into curricula specifically targeted for women in computing initiatives, with the objective of attracting and retaining more women in computing fields.<br/> <br/>This research will explore extension of powerful language-based security techniques, in-lined reference monitoring (IRM) and static analysis, to the novel and significant problem domain of hybrid app security.

Complex numbers include quantities such as the square root of negative one. The calculus studies how physical or geometric quantities vary in space or time. The combination of these ideas (called complex analysis) leads to far-reaching and beautiful results about smoothly varying complex quantities (called holomorphic functions). One may use these ideas to model various natural phenomena such as electrical attraction or the motion of liquids. These considerations also have surprising consequences in other parts of mathematics, such as the properties of prime numbers, the geometry of higher dimensional spaces, and the study of equations (called partial differential equations) used to describe many physical processes such as heat conduction and the propagation of waves. This research project studies the behavior of holomorphic functions as one approaches the boundary of the region in higher dimensional space where the function is defined. The investigator will also continue his successful mentoring of undergraduate student research in related topics.<br/><br/>The behavior of holomorphic functions of several variables is well-understood on strongly pseudoconvex domains. In this project, the goal is to study the extension of such results to new and more general types of domains. Among the questions under study are estimates for the solutions of the solutions of the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations, understanding what happens when there are no such estimates, and the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions. The domains to be studied include piecewise smooth domains (in particular product domains), Levi-flat Stein domains in complex manifolds, and non-pseudoconvex domains, both with and without ""holes."" The research will involve both the investigation of general questions and the careful study of particular examples, which can exhibit unexpected phenomena associated to these domains. Tools employed in this project to study these problems include a priori estimates, integral formulas, and algebraic methods based on sheaf theory, as well as insights from other parts of mathematics such as partial differential equations, functional analysis, and differential geometry."

As needed, they employ conceptualizations of space, so-called cognitive maps, that differ in granularity, scope, and precision. Based on the context, people use different implicit assumptions to interpret a spatial relation such as ""A is contained in B."" The assumptions made or implied by different conceptualizations often even contradict another (e.g., in ""the lake contains a bay"" the bay is a subregion of the lake while in ""the lake contains an island"" the island is surrounded by the lake). This is not an issue for people: we are able to quickly and reliably decide which conceptualization is most suitable in a specific situation, often choosing the simplest applicable conceptualization. For instance, people can quickly make navigation decisions (""Do I need to travel north or south on the Interstate?"") or answer simple spatial queries (""Is the ocean east or west from here?""). Similar capabilities for flexibly utilizing multiple conceptualizations would make computational tools for recording and processing spatial information much more powerful and user-friendly. Towards this goal, the proposed research will investigate a formalism and basic procedures for automatically choosing a spatial representation best suited to solve a specific task, such as finding data with certain qualitative characteristics, answering a spatial query, or testing a spatial hypothesis. The research will contribute to a theoretical foundation for collecting, accessing, and manipulating spatial information in more natural ways without impeding its efficient processing in information systems. It will lower the barrier of entry for interacting with and analyzing spatial information and promotes technologies to cut time and costs typically spent on transforming diverse spatial data sets into a coherent model.<br/><br/>In this project, the different spatial conceptualizations will be encoded as machine-interpretable spatial ontologies and placed in a structured ontology repository that leverages relationships from mathematical logic. The formal foundation for comparing the expressivity of ontologies using the mathematical notion of definability will be developed and used to organize the repository by differences in ontological assumptions and expressivity. This structure will be exploited by procedures for automatically selecting an ontology that best fits a specific spatial task. In addition, formal encodings of the knowledge necessary to convert spatial information from one ontology to another will be investigated, accompanied by procedures that utilize this information for automatically identifying and converting pieces of geometric background knowledge relevant to a specific spatial task. The research in this project will contribute to a better understanding of how logical relationships can be utilized to formally compare the expressiveness of two spatial ontologies, and how a spatial ontology repository can be supplemented by information that allows automated conversion of knowledge based on different ontologies.

As device length scales shrink, pushing the limits of silicon technology, new atomically thin semi-conducting materials such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as a potential replacement to silicon. While doping control has been perfected for silicon technology over many decades, controlled synthesis and doping strategies for atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are still in their infancy. In this project, the investigators propose to demonstrate a stable doping strategy for such materials which involves substitution of the transition metal atom by an impurity metal. The investigators propose to show how both hole and electron doping is possible using such an approach. This work could enable controllable and stable doping of transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets to tune their carrier type and density, thereby paving the way for next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices constructed from atomically-thin semiconductors. To integrate research and teaching, the investigators propose specially designed interactive learning modules (virtual labs) which will be integrated into the curriculum at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Outreach includes demonstrations of the interactive modules to students and teachers from local area high schools; this will help to popularize science and attract underrepresented groups to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>There are very few reports of direct substitution (doping) of transition metal atoms in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides. This is likely due to the fact that transition metal atoms are far more stable than chalcogens and hence much harder to replace. However initial results by the investigators indicate that large-area (in situ) transition metal doping for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is indeed possible during the chemical vapor deposition growth process. In this project, the investigators propose first-principles density functional theory calculations over a wide range of doping concentrations to understand how the semiconducting and optoelectronic properties of such materials are affected by transition metal doping. On the experimental side, the investigators propose to demonstrate that the doping can be systematically tuned over a wide range. Variable temperature electronic transport measurements, using a back gated field-effect transistor configuration will be performed to establish how the material's electronic properties are influenced by doping. Further, photoluminescence and differential reflectance spectroscopy over a wide range of temperatures and dopant concentrations will be carried out to understand how doping affects the optoelectronic properties of the material. The project will culminate in a technology demonstration featuring an atomically sharp p-n junction device. To accomplish the above tasks, the investigators have assembled an interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise. Collaboration between experimentalists and a theorist will enable the team to develop an in-depth understanding of the underlying physics and make rapid progress towards controllably and stably doping atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide materials."

Research shows that world-wide, despite its importance to the life sciences, natural selection remains one of the most widely misunderstood processes in biology. Specifically, studies reveal that scientific misconceptions about natural selection not only persist among high school students and undergraduates who are usual targets of instruction on evolution by natural selection, but, disturbingly, also among many of the teachers trained to teach them. Research further reveals that the origin of many of these misconceptions can be traced to intuitive cognitive biases found at the elementary school level. This project will address this problem by building and testing a learning sequence on natural selection at the early elementary grades before intuitive theoretical misconceptions are likely to have become entrenched. This effort will expand existing infrastructure for research and education currently supported through a university, to school partnership involving elementary educators, curriculum developers, professional development providers, interdisciplinary academic researchers and cognitive development expert consultants.  <br/><br/>The project focuses on understanding whether the proposed natural selection learning sequence is even viable and beneficial for elementary school students and teachers given children's representational constraints, the development and entrenchment of intuitive cognitive biases and teacher science anxiety. The two central aims will be to: (1) develop the core architecture and explore the feasibility of an expanded elementary school learning sequence on natural selection; (2) examine the educative professional development benefits to elementary school teachers of the developed story-based intervention materials. Six interventions will be conducted through an iteratively designed series of laboratory, afterschool, or classroom empirical studies to explore the viability of mechanistically teaching K-2 children about within- and between-species adaptation by natural selection. Due to the non-binary nature of data that will be generated by the studies, core analyses will be repeated measures ordinal logistic regressions with chi-squared tests for significance. Effect sizes will be indexed by odds ratio. Results from this work will advance scientific knowledge and educational practice by yielding insights about children?s capacities as explanatory thinkers and theory-builders. Materials and products (storybooks, animations and assessment tools) will directly benefit schools, teachers, children and parents in the State of Massachusetts and nationally."

Organic molecules released into the atmosphere through anthropogenic and biogenic activity undergo reactions that result in the formation of oxidized products.  The enhanced polar character of these oxidized products results in their ability to interact through hydrogen bonding. Although weak, hydrogen bonds are pervasive.

Glueck at Dartmouth College for research on new methods to prepare phosphines with a chiral phosphorus stereocenter.  Such chiral phosphines are useful in asymmetric catalysis, which is commonly employed in the pharmaceutical industry to make single-enantiomer drugs.  However, the development of chiral phosphines ligands has been relatively slow because of a lack of general synthetic methods. This project further improved the methods to form phosphorus-carbon and phosphorus-phosphorus bonds, providing new and potentially useful synthetic approaches to this problem. This project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate student researchers, and broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, especially Native Americans, in chemistry, education and research.  The results are disseminated broadly in publications and conference presentations, and are integrated into outreach programs.<br/><br/>Metal-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis, useful in the preparation of single-enantiomer drugs, often requires chiral phosphine ligands.  Many are known, but their limited structural diversity and ligand-dependent selectivity in catalysis makes new types of chiral phosphines and new routes to them valuable.  This award focuses on P-stereogenic phosphines, which despite their commercial success have been relatively unexplored because of a lack of general synthetic methods.  Chiral phosphines are usually prepared either by resolution or by using a stoichiometric amount of a chiral auxiliary. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis allows more economical use of expensive chiral reagents. Expanding the scope and improving the selectivity of such processes make this unusual approach to a class of industrially important compounds more valuable. The research addresses these problems while investigating two fundamental topics in catalysis: (1) use of earth-abundant metals and (2) positive cooperativity.  The targets are P-stereogenic heterocycles, which are useful both as ligands and as building blocks for other P-stereogenic phosphines. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P-stereogenic phosphines has been reported using platinum group metals, which induce rapid pyramidal inversion in the metal-phosphido groups and makes them nucleophilic.  Professor Glueck and his group hypothesize that precious metals are not required and instead use copper catalysts.  Their weaker metal-ligand bonds may result in faster ligand substitution and turnover. To prepare P-stereogenic heterocycles, they hypothesize that intramolecular processes to make bonds between two stereocenters result in higher selectivity via positive cooperativity.  The carbon stereocenter in chiral epoxides are used for dynamic P-stereocontrol in synthesis of phosphiranes by P-C bond formation.  The configurations of two P-stereocenters are controlled simultaneously as they are connected to make P-stereogenic diphosphines.  Students who carry out the research receive training in synthesis and characterization of inorganic, organometallic, and organic compounds, mechanistic studies of their reactions, in catalysis, and in the presentation of their results both to other scientists and to the public."

To complement the experimental effort, the principal investigator is developing and teaching a graduate course in ultracold atom physics, focusing on experimental techniques and potential applications. The course serves to train graduate students from the PI's lab in teaching through guest lecture opportunities. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The competition between superconductivity and magnetism can give rise to exotic phases of quantum matter. Over fifty years ago, Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin and Ovchinnikov (FFLO) predicted a quantum phase where the Cooper pairs of a superconductor in a magnetic field condense at non-zero momentum. There has been indirect evidence for the existence of this phase in layered organic superconductors, heavy fermion materials and ultracold atomic gases, but a direct detection of its defining signatures has been elusive. The goal of this project is the direct detection of the FFLO phase in a superfluid atomic Fermi gas with spin imbalance. The research team uses atom-resolved in-situ imaging of the gas to search for its smoking gun signature: a spatial oscillation of the magnetization and superfluid gap that depends on the polarization of the gas. The search for this phase is conducted in a lower-dimensional lattice system where Fermi surface nesting effects are predicted to enhance the region of the phase diagram occupied by the FFLO phase. The team seeks to understand the low-temperature phase diagram of spin-imbalanced two-dimensional Fermi gases, use quantum gas microscopy to image imprinted solitonic lattices through the sharp variation of their magnetization and local density of states and apply these imaging techniques to search for FFLO in a thermal equilibrium state."

The overall goals of the project are to understanding the natural dynamical and microphysical processes by which precipitation forms and evolves within orographic winter storms and to determine the physical processes by which cloud seeding with silver iodide (AgI), either from ground generators or aircraft, impacts the amount and spatial distribution of snow falling across a river basin.  The core scientific objective of the proposal are to: 1) Evaluate the role of mesoscale and microscale dynamics and of the underlying terrain in the formation, growth, and fallout of natural ice crystals in winter storms through observations, 2) Investigate how the natural snow growth process is altered as a result of airborne AgI seeding through both observations and model simulations, and 3) Evaluate the effects of ground seeding on snowfall amount and distribution."

While wetland plants consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, wetlands also produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that influences the global climate.  Methane production and its movement within the soils of wetlands results from many simultaneous processes. Microorganisms living in wetland soils where there is no oxygen can produce methane. Methane, being lighter than air, works its way through the soil and can escape into the atmosphere. However, during transport through soils, specialized bacteria can consume methane if the local chemistry is favorable to that process. Additionally, plants can facilitate the movement of methane from soils to the atmosphere. This project will study the transport of methane through wetland vegetation and improve mathematical models of that process. This will be accomplished by developing new measurement techniques that can more accurately predict how much methane is transported through wetland plants. Results from this work will improve our general understanding of how wetlands function with respect to release of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas important in climate modeling.<br/><br/>Plant transport is perhaps the most complex and least understood of the common methane pathways from the soil to the atmosphere.  Moreover, wetlands are frequently comprised of a tight mosaic of land cover types. However, few models currently account for the effects of plant heterogeneity within the wetland on the total methane flux. Plants move methane both through their root aeration system, aerenchymous tissue, and through their xylem and stomata. It has been hypothesized that methane dissolved into the pore water at the plant root zone is mobilized by the plant as it transpires. However, the role of stomatally conducted methane is not clear and is almost always ignored by modern methane emission models. In this project, researchers will design and deploy novel chambers to quantify plant-mediated fluxes of methane from wetlands and use those data to parameterize a general model of the process. The study site for chamber deployment will be the Old Woman Creek National Estuary Research Reserve.  These activities are part of a comprehensive measurement campaign involving traditional static chambers to measure diffusive fluxes through the water column, pore-water dialysis peepers, which provide a profile of methane concentrations in the soil, and an eddy-covariance tower, which will provide site level measurements of methane flux into the atmosphere. The plant hydrodynamics model, FETCH2, and a wetland methane model will be coupled to simulate the methane emitted through plants."

Hake.<br/><br/>Increasing crop yield during drought is a critical challenge for U.S. corn production. The male flowering structure or tassel of the corn plant makes several branches, which produce the pollen necessary for fertilizing female flowers found in corn ears. During severe drought early in the growing season, energy is re-routed from the tassel to the ear and the number of tassel branches decreases, potentially leading to a shortage of pollen during the season. Sorghum's flowering structure, or panicle, is highly drought-resistant and sorghum has therefore been studied as an ideal crop for drier regions of the U.S. This project aims to understand genome-wide responses to drought in corn tassels and sorghum panicles, providing molecular information for breeding better plant performance during drought. Broader impacts include the formation of undergraduate outreach programs promoting STEM majors, research, and career opportunities to increase participation and retention of LGBT undergraduate students in STEM academic and professional fields. Students will be surveyed over time and long-term management of the programs will be transferred to campus advocacy groups, providing an outreach model for campuses nationwide. Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, biological modeling, and molecular genetics. <br/><br/>Although previous studies have elucidated gene regulatory networks (GRNs) responsible for tassel branching in maize, little is known about how tassel GRNs respond to abiotic stresses, such as drought. Whereas several maize GRNs are conserved in other grasses, sorghum panicle GRNs have not been established. Using drought to manipulate tassel/panicle morphology, this project will explore GRN-wide drought response in maize and sorghum, including known mutants of tassel/panicle morphology. This research will use RNAseq to analyze inflorescence tissue from several different drought simulations. Leveraging existing GRN and genome resources in maize and sorghum, this project will generate and compare dynamic, drought responsive tassel/panicle GRNs. With these GRNs, morphological models linking RNA levels to tassel/panicle branching will be constructed. To test morphological-GRN models, this project will generate and analyze novel tassel/panicle mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. Research findings and analysis methodologies will be disseminated through conferences, publications, and submissions to data/code repositories (NCBI-SRA, NCBI-GEO, GitHub, MaizeGDB, and Grassius).<br/><br/>Keywords: abiotic stress, co-expression networks, drought, inflorescence biology, maize genetics"

This work will be managed in teleconferences, virtual workshops, newsletters, and annual meetings with one-day schools for young and developing arctic researchers. The project will support synthesis across the suite of Arctic models and observations by: (i) Conducting coordinated research on modeling with resolutions resolving small scale processes (for example, resolving eddies and internal waves); (ii) Holding scientific meetings and schools for new investigators including virtual teleconferences; (iii) Creating teams of modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists to work on topical issues of Arctic sea ice and oceanic dynamics and thermodynamics; (iv) Conducting collaboration with other similar projects focused on other aspects of arctic/global climate (atmospheric, terrestrial, cryospheric); (v) Disseminating findings to broader communities; and (vi) Training a new generation of ocean and sea-ice observationalists and modelers. The most significant contributions are likely to be results of internationally coordinated development and analysis of modeling and observing at high and very high resolution; identification of uncertainties and errors and causes of these errors and model discrepancies, and recommendations for improvements of existing regional coupled ice-ocean models and Global Climate Models, by implementing new physics for Arctic processes."

The simplest examples of such spaces are called Riemann surfaces, which are complex manifolds with one complex dimension (and therefore two real dimensions), and include the familiar surfaces of the sphere and of a donut. Higher-dimensional complex manifolds include for example Calabi-Yau manifolds, which are a fundamental tool in string theory. Complex manifolds are ubiquitous objects in mathematics, and have wide-ranging applications in physics and engineering. The proposed research projects will expand our knowledge of the geometry of higher-dimensional complex manifolds using analytic techniques, and in particular partial differential equations (PDEs). These projects lie at the intersection of several mathematical disciplines, such as differential, algebraic and symplectic geometry, complex analysis and PDEs, and techniques from all these fields are necessary to attack them. Progress on these questions will not only shed some light on some basic problems in mathematics, but will also have applications in physics and other sciences.<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes to use techniques from geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations to investigate problems about the geometry of complex manifolds. The first project is about applications of analysis to the construction of currents on complex manifolds, which are used to study the geometry of (1,1) cohomology classes on compact Kahler manifolds. In the second project the principal investigator will develop new analytic techniques to construct special metrics on non-Kahler complex manifolds, by solving Monge-Ampere equations for (n-1,n-1) forms, building upon earlier work of the principal investigator with Szekelyhidi and Weinkove which culminated in the solution of Gauduchon's conjecture. The third project is about understanding collapsed limits of Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds. This is closely related to the theory of mirror symmetry, which was inspired by physical considerations. The fourth project is centered on Donaldson's program to extend Yau's solution of the Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic four manifolds, and to its applications to symplectic topology."

The precisely defined pore sizes and surface openings in these molecular sponges only allow molecules of specific size, which is tunable, to be transported through them. It is these unique properties of metal-organic molecular sieves that find their uses in a wide range of applications including separations, catalysis, sensors, drug delivery, and sustainable energy technologies. Currently, these molecular sponges are made using precipitation from a solution. These methods are too expensive for wide commercial uses, primarily because they are not readily scalable. Here, the work aims to develop a new, large-scale production technology based on a scalable spray-drying technique to drastically reduce the fabrication costs and to improve transport properties of these materials. The spray-drying technique will allow controlling and optimizing the pore aperture sizes and pore architecture of nanoporous molecular sponges for such advanced applications. A novel measurement technique will be used to study microscale gas transport in these materials. These studies will be performed to guide the design of molecular sieves optimized with respect to their transport properties.

This fundamental research will lead to a set of design rules for the commercially-viable synthesis of multi-functional metal-organic framework materials and their composites with unique microstructures optimized for molecular transport and related catalytic performance."

Here, it is hoped that the limits as the characteristic tends towards infinity have simpler interpretations and values, and can be related to geometric measures of singularities for complex algebraic varieties. The interaction with geometric methods in characteristic zero stemming from complex algebraic geometry is central to the project, and one of the main objectives of the work is to better describe the geometry and broader connections of F-invariants."

The specific questions addressed here are long-standing open problems, progress on which will be of wide interest. The project will develop new tools for approximate counting and is likely to make new and useful connections between statistical physics, probability and computational complexity. The research results will be disseminated via course notes, a summer school and workshops. Any practical algorithms that result will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to extend the known boundary of polynomial-time tractability for counting problems, to understand whether randomness is essential and how it could be eliminated, and to push the limits of the current fastest randomized algorithms towards practicality.

It provides many vital ecological and hydromorphological functions and is becoming a major tool in river restoration. Research on IAV has chiefly focused on sediment transport and flow resistance, while its role in inducing hyporheic exchange has been neglected. Hyporheic exchange is the main process connecting streams with streambeds by moving in-stream water in and out of the streambed sediment through the hyporheic zone, HZ, which serves as an interface between surface and ground waters. The HZ promotes important biological and chemical processes, which affect the quality of both stream and streambed waters. Consequently, modeling hyporheic fluxes due to IAV will provide key information for river restoration practices in which planting has been advocated, a $1B per year industry. Additionally, predictions of hyporheic exchange and processes are essential to quantify solute transport and transformation along streams and rivers. Thus the goal of this research is to model hyporheic flow due to IAV. This will provide a fundamental and predictive understanding of the processes that control hyporheic exchange due to flow and IAV interaction. It will advance knowledge on hyporheic flow field near the rhizosphere, the region of sediment directly influenced by root secretions and associated soil microorganisms and the ability to model solute, nutrient, contaminant, and pathogen transport along stream networks by including the effect of IAV. The models developed in this project will be used to predict hyporheic processes in streams with vegetation and will be incorporated into basin-scale transport models of solute and nutrients. A new transformative after school program will be developed to introduce 5th-6th grade students to STEM disciplines through hands-on activities and lessons with a mobile educational flume. In addition undergraduate and graduate Civil Engineering students will be trained. <br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to mechanistically understand, quantify, and model the effects of IAV on hyporheic exchange as a function of IAV density, patch size, and patch distribution under different flow conditions. IAVs will be considered with three schematizations: 1) interaction between flow and an individual emergent and submerged vegetation stem, 2) interaction between flow and one single submerged vegetation patch, and 3) interaction between flow and multiple submerged vegetation patches. This will be addressed with novel tracer test flume experiments, coupling Matching Index Reflectometry, Particle Image Velocimetry, and analytical and numerical modeling, and by testing three specific hypotheses: hyporheic exchange has an inverse U-shaped (increases to a maximum and then decreases with increasing value of the independent variable) relationship with: (1) IAV density; (2) IAV patch size; and (3) the percent of streambed covered by multiple dense IAV patches. <br/>"

Having more women in the STEM workforce will help narrow the male-female wage gap and help reduce workforce shortages. This project at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology entitled Skilled Women Get STEM Jobs is designed to enable female students to prepare for careers in high demand, typically male-dominated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This project will contribute to the body of evidence about effective ways for high schools, community colleges, and industries to develop STEM pipelines that encourage young women to enter typically male-dominated technical careers. The project will have an impact not only on the large area served by the college, but also nationally, by disseminating information about successful recruiting and retention activities to encourage similar initiatives at other colleges and in industry groups. <br/><br/>The project will focus on three college technician programs that are vital to the region and the nation: (a)  Machine Tool & Computer Aided Manufacturing that educates technicians for jobs as machinists, tool and die makers, and computer numerically controlled operators and programmers; (b) Electrical Technology that educates technicians for the construction industry as electricians, the manufacturing industry as industrial electricians, and the utility industry as power generation and distribution technicians; and (c) Water & Environmental Technology Program that educates technicians for water and wastewater treatment at municipal and private facilities, and for food processing, paper production, waste-to-energy, and environmental companies. The project will have an especially strong impact on water technology outreach initiatives as the college offers the only Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) approved associate degree program. The program will communicate directly and regularly with the PA DEP training section and the Pennsylvania Water Environment Association. National dissemination will be through the Water Environment Federation. To strengthen the three aforementioned technician programs, the project will build a high school to college pipeline to (a) encourage female high school students to enroll in college programs that offer solid job prospects, (b) engage the enrolled students through an informal group mentoring program and internship opportunities, and (c) facilitate their entry into the workforce by ensuring their familiarity with industries and job opportunities. Recruitment activities target females at 11 high schools through industry tours, college tours, and hands on cross disciplinary immersion workshops that develop a product designed by the participants to solve a local environmental problem. While research indicates that one-on-one mentoring using female role models works, this strategy will not bring results in industries or college programs that are virtually devoid of women. The project will test a novel approach to see if contact with female technicians, industry tours, and hands-on cross-disciplinary workshops are promising practices for attracting female high school students into three targeted STEM fields. It will also develop and test a replicable model for such workshops and a comprehensive evaluation will help determine the most effective strategies. Within three years, female enrollment will increase from 6% college-wide to 20% in the three targeted programs, and female students in those programs will be retained at the same high rate as males."

Such discrete dynamical systems occur as models throughout science and engineering.  Polynomials and rational functions of a single variable provide basic examples of non-invertible, algebraic, discrete dynamical systems by iteration. Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated and chaotic dynamical behavior; the most famous is the family of quadratic polynomials where a point x is mapped to x ""squared"" plus a constant. The constant can be a real or complex number. This family gives rise to the Mandelbrot set, which continues to baffle researchers. A fundamental problem in the mathematical study of these systems is to characterize their stability: under what circumstances -- and by how much -- can we perturb a system while maintaining its long-term dynamical features? The primary goal of this research project is to explore connections between the stability of algebraic dynamical systems and the algebraic or geometric structures that are preserved under iteration. The first connections between the algebra and dynamics of these models were discovered in the 19th century. This project will exploit modern tools from arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems to strengthen these connections and deepen our understanding of the systems themselves. <br/><br/>The project studies: (1) the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, with dynamical methods; (2) a series of substantial conjectures about ""unlikely intersections"" in moduli spaces of dynamical systems; and (3) the 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry of a rational function, with curvature form equal to its measure of maximal entropy. The main goal of this project is to build relations between the algebra and the geometry of dynamical systems on algebraic varieties, with an eye towards applications in Diophantine geometry. The second goal of the project is a study of rational maps in dimension one, particularly an exploration of the canonical shape of the dynamical system and its stability properties. In recent work, the investigator and collaborator developed new methods of proof incorporating tools from both complex and non-Archimedean analysis and formulated a conjecture about the dynamics of rational maps that encompasses known results about elliptic curves. This project aims to investigate particular cases of this conjecture while developing the theory to connect these results to the study of the symmetries and stability and invariants of complex dynamical systems in dimensions one and two."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising interdisciplinary scholar at the intersection of the anthropological sciences, environment and human health. In the tropics, reliance on wild food systems and unsustainable hunting threatens food security and livelihoods long-term, and increases risk of disease transmission from wildlife to humans.  Despite the risks to human health and food security, the issue of wild game hunting remains a target of conservation, but is rarely considered in public health and development strategies.  The aim of this research is to understand the role of nutrition and culture in driving consumption of bushmeat (meat from non-domesticated mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds hunted for food in tropical forests) in West Africa. The postdoctoral research fellow, a woman in environmental science, will be trained in nutritional ecology and cultural anthropology.  Through combined field and laboratory research, the fellow will be introduced to unique research resources, sites, and facilities that will foster international collaborations between institutions in the United States and Nigeria.  These activities will provide unique mentoring and training opportunities for students and Nigerian scientists. This research will further the progress of science by deciphering the role of dietary quality of bushmeat, and bringing the issue into the scope of development and public health policy. Results will have implications for national health, prosperity, and welfare beyond this study system.  For example, understanding the drivers of bushmeat consumption assists policy in developing complementary food sources and preventing emergence of infectious diseases from wildlife. Research activities in the field will have both direct and indirect benefits to human health, endangered species, and vulnerable habitats.  <br/><br/>This research integrates methods from nutrition and ecology, with both quantitatively and qualitatively driven methods from the social sciences, to measure the unique role of bushmeat in determining dietary choices and maintaining food security in Nigerian hunting communities.   The project will generate original data through:  1) comparative nutritional assays of wild and domestic animal food resources; 2) quantitative analyses of semi-structured surveys of household dietary diversity and food insecurity; and 3) qualitative analyses of focus group discussions, key informant interviews, participant observation, and storytelling to assess the cultural contexts of hunting and consumption.  Nutritional composition will be related to dietary choices and food security across multiple cultural contexts to provide new insights into interactions between human culture and nutritional science. Wild meat consumption is a pressing environmental and health concern, and findings will provide the basis for integrative recommendations that will inform food security, public health, and conservation policies.

The second goal is to learn more about how middle school students propose, support, critique and revise design solutions. This project will result in new findings about how middle school students learn about the engineering design process, how they propose, support, critique and revise engineering designs; and how different aspects of instruction support or constrain middle school student use of disciplinary core ideas and cross-cutting concepts while engaging in the engineering design process. This project will directly impact four teachers and a diverse group of approximately 1000 students. Once the instructional model is developed, it has the potential to be adopted by teachers throughout the United States. This new approach to instruction will enable science teachers to integrate engineering concepts and practices into any middle school science course as prescribed by the Next Generation Science Standards - without needing to adopt or purchase an entirely new curriculum. In addition, the project has the potential to enhance interest in the field of engineering and to broaden the participation of women and minorities in engineering.<br/> <br/>The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for middle school science teachers to add engineering design into their curriculum so all students can learn to use core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and engineering practices to solve problems.

The intellectual merits are to provide a new basis for thinking about how to scale future generations of both hardware and software, and in particular to develop novel uses of operating system kernel functionality, as well as transactional hardware and software techniques. The project's broader significance and importance is the benefit to society provided by higher performing, less expensive, and more reliable software.<br/><br/>The specific techniques addressed are unsynchronized traversals, in which a thread navigates through a linked data structure without writing to memory, and atomic sequences of memory operations, where race conditions are eliminated by making a sequence of individual memory operations appear to take place instantaneously. Although these techniques have been successfully deployed in many ad-hoc instances, they have never been packaged as general-purpose mechanisms because they can have complex and dangerous interactions with standard memory management schemes. This project will exploit recent developments in hardware architectures and operating system structures to develop automated, systematic run-time support, making these techniques accessible to non-specialists."

This project entitled Rural Access Mechatronics Program (RAMP) at Clark College in rural southwest Washington state is designed to increase the quantity and quality of mechatronics technicians  by developing a hybrid/online Certificate of Completion in Mechatronics Fundamentals. This will provide rural students, under-and unemployed workers, and incumbent workers a new option for an educational pathway from a certificate in mechatronics to an Associate in Applied Technology (AAT) degree with anytime anywhere courses resulting from the hybrid format. Upon successful completion, students will be prepared for either technician positions or be ready to progress on the educational pathway to a baccalaureate degree. The objectives of the project are to institutionalize hybrid learning options through faculty professional development and increase the number of quality mechatronics technicians. The curriculum will be validated by multiple advanced manufacturing employers in the region who are concerned by the rapidly growing need for more skilled mechatronics technicians in the Washington Oregon border area. Through the RAMP pilot, Clark will make significant contributions to the larger technological education community as the RAMP model will be replicable in other rural communities where access to education is an issue.<br/> <br/>The hybrid modality of the certificate opens up access to stackable certificates and an AAT degree for more rural students. The project addresses critical barriers to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education such as mathematics prerequisites by embedding the needed mathematics competencies into the mechatronics classes of the hybrid curriculum. Faculty members are being prepared with the skills needed to deliver hybrid curricula, designed specifically to meet the needs of a rural population, thereby expanding hybrid learning options throughout the educational pathway. RAMP builds upon and expands the work of other ATE centers and projects including 1) applying best practices gleaned from iMEC (1304835) to guide the transition of curricula into a hybrid format; 2) partnering with CA2VES (1501695) to leverage their knowledge in hybrid/online delivery; utilize their modules/virtual labs; and investigate their video library for use in RAMP professional development efforts; and 3) utilizing the best practices of CARCAM (1304036) for recruitment and retention of rural and first-generation students. Employers are being engaged in the curriculum development process to assure that mechatronics technicians have the skills and knowledge to be well prepared to work in industry. A comprehensive evaluation is being developed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and its deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices."

Such graphs are particularly suited to the modeling of large-scale sensor and transceiver networks, which are becoming more common as electronic devices become smaller and cheaper and are interconnected in very large networks. Modeling the behavior of these networks is becoming more and more important, and the analysis of the behavior of these networks when they become extremely large is becoming increasingly relevant in practical applications. This award supports research on the properties of these large-scale networks, as well as training of graduate students and early-career researchers in the mathematics of random graphs. <br/><br/>The study of random geometric graphs originated with questions about the way fluids seep through porous media. More recently, the study of large-scale electronic and communication networks has prompted many questions about random geometric graphs. The basic model of random geometric graphs was proposed by Gilbert over fifty years ago: take points randomly in the plane according to a Poisson point process of unit intensity, and join two whenever they are within a prescribed distance of each other. The central question concerning this model is: for what values of the prescribed distance do we obtain an infinite connected component? Surprisingly, even after fifty years, only rough upper and lower bounds are known for the critical value of the prescribed distance. Some properties of this Gilbert model are known, but many other questions still remain unanswered. This research project addresses some of these questions, as well as other questions about related models of random graph inspired by both percolation theory and large-scale communication networks."

Each year, for three years, cohorts of 5 students will spend 8 weeks at Estacin de Biologa, Chamela (EBCh) working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on three general avenues of investigation: 1) interactions in the parasite-host system centered on the agents of Chagas disease (kissing bugs), 2) ecological responses of vertebrates to intense seasonality, and 3) current and future effects of a major coastal highway on ecological connectivity of vertebrates. The world-class facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from Mxico and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting will provide an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations. This program will help build the next generation of internationally-literate scientists by guiding bilingual Hispanic-American students to conduct science, facilitating language and cultural literacy with their non-Spanish speaking peers, and developing the skills, connections, and confidence to pursue careers in the sciences. The program will also create opportunities for CWU faculty to develop collaborations with Mexican scientists and encourage Mexican scholars to visit CWU where they can share their insights, discoveries, and culture with our broader community. <br/><br/>The Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve in western Mexico is surrounded by some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in the world. SDTF comprise almost half of the world's tropical forests, representing a larger fraction than rain forests. They provide a set of ecosystem services that rival wet forests, and they harbor a remarkable concentration of endemic species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Despite their importance, SDTFs are among the least studied and most threatened of the world's forested ecosystems and, as a result, are at greater risk than are wet forests. Students will work UNAM's Institute of Biology to investigate the relationships among blood-feeding triatomine insects, the parasite they carry, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the mammals the insects feed on. This work will aid in our understanding of which mammals in SDTF serve as reservoirs of Chagas disease. Other students will track reptiles and amphibians in the forest during the extreme transition from dry season to wet season in July. This research will contribute new insights into how vertebrate ectotherms manage strong seasonality, a defining feature of SDTF. Some students may investigate parrot ecology in SDTF, exploring variation in food and nesting resources for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds. Others will use remote cameras and transect surveys to monitor wildlife activity in the forest and along Mexican highway 200, which bisects the biosphere reserve. Results from this project will be used to guide decisions on how best to minimize habitat fragmentation associated with planned expansion of that highway. Students will be members of a cohesive team working together on ongoing research by our Mexican mentors to address relevant and important issues in the structure, functioning and conservation of SDTF."

The proposed experiments are unified by their focus on micro-mechanics, broadly defined. One set will measure structural and dynamical properties of colloidal glasses and crystals with goals to identify regions within these materials that are ""soft"" and exhibit increased propensity to deform or rearrange. A second set will investigate lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals. These liquid crystals are unusual in that they twist very easily which leads to formation of chiral structures from achiral mesogens, they exhibit two levels of assembly hierarchy from molecules to rod-mesogens to LC phases, and they are water soluble. The consequences of these properties will be probed by diffusion experiments which track motions of particles dressed by local LC director fields, by study of the competition between elastic energy and molecular assembly hierarchy in ""extreme"" confined geometries, and in novel ""drying"" of multi-phase droplets. Collectively, the experiments use advanced optical microscopies, light scattering and rheometry for sample observation, and they require formulation of novel soft materials via controlled suspension chemistry and physics, microfluidics, etc. For example, colloidal particles with different shapes, interactions and potential for in-situ manipulation are/will-be developed."

The MJO is a large region of convection and rainfall that forms over the Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward into the central equatorial Pacific.   The MJO influences weather and climate worldwide, affecting the formation of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, atmospheric rivers that produce floods and landslides on the US west coast, and the onset of El Nino events, among other impacts. Despite its importance and concerted efforts over several decades, the MJO has not yet been adequately explained, and weather and  climate models have difficulty simulating and predicting it.<br/><br/>Research under this award addresses two aspects of the diurnal cycle, the first of which is the influence of the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature (SST) in moistening the overlying atmosphere.  When the MJO is in its ""suppressed"" phase, in which fair weather prevails in the absence of organized convection and rainfall, SST has a relatively pronounced diurnal cycle.  The diurnal cycle of SST is expected to result in greater surface evaporation and more vigorous vertical mixing of moisture throughout the lower atmosphere, with the overall moistening serving to promote the onset of the ""active"" phase of the MJO.  A suite of computer simulations is used to determine the importance of the diurnal cycle of SSTs for moistening the atmosphere and promoting MJO onset.<br/><br/>Further research considers the change in the diurnal cycle of cloudiness that occurs between the suppressed and active phases of the MJO.  The smaller and less developed clouds of the suppressed phase occur preferentially in the afternoon, while the deep convective clouds of the active phase are most prominent at night.  The PI hypothesizes that this shift in the time of maximum cloudiness has implications for the solar heating of the atmosphere that constitute a positive feedback, enhancing convection during the active phase and inhibiting it in the suppressed phase.  Further computer simulations will be performed to test this hypothesis.<br/><br/>Finally, the PI will perform a simulation of an MJO event observed during the DYNAMO field campaign (see AGS-1022899) using a global high-resolution nonhydrostatic model (the ICON model).  The results of the simulation will be used to further test the hypothesized effects of the diurnal cycle on the MJO. <br/><br/>As noted above, the work has societal broader impacts due to the worldwide weather and climate impacts of the MJO and the potential of this research to improve MJO forecasts.  In addition, the work supports the PI at an early stage of his career, thereby promoting the future workforce in the research area.  Also, the work is conducted at the Max Planck Institute of Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg, Germany, under the supervision of Dr. Cathy Hohenegger.  The host institution is among the world's top climate modeling centers, and scientific collaboration between a US PI and MPI-M scientists is expected to be beneficial to the US research community.<br/><br/>This award was supported with funding from the Office of International Science & Engineering as well as the Climate and Large-scale Dynamics Program."

The goal is to improve our understanding of oceanic and sea-ice processes and mechanisms driving Arctic Ocean changes. Although its future focus will depend to a large degree on the decisions of the participants as their research develops, there are three broad areas of interest now identified: the development and analysis of modeling and observing at high and very high spatial and temporal resolution, identification of uncertainties and errors in models, and recommendations for improvements of existing models. A coordinated international community approach to the investigation of Arctic Ocean variability is the best way to assess uncertainty in results and conclusions made by different modelers, scientific groups, or institutions. Moreover, it ensures leveraging of research talent and expenditures in other parts of the world. <br/><br/>The results of this project that will have broader impacts will be is a synthesis that integrates observational and modeling efforts toward the overall goal of developing advanced Arctic models able to accurately simulate the past, describe the present, and predict future Arctic conditions.

The project will be focused on targeting important scientific problems and enhancing collaboration and coordination among arctic marine modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists. This work will be managed in teleconferences, virtual workshops, newsletters, and annual meetings with one-day schools for young and developing arctic researchers. The project will support synthesis across the suite of Arctic models and observations by: (i) Conducting coordinated research on modeling with resolutions resolving small scale processes (for example, resolving eddies and internal waves); (ii) Holding scientific meetings and schools for new investigators including virtual teleconferences; (iii) Creating teams of modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists to work on topical issues of Arctic sea ice and oceanic dynamics and thermodynamics; (iv) Conducting collaboration with other similar projects focused on other aspects of arctic/global climate (atmospheric, terrestrial, cryospheric); (v) Disseminating findings to broader communities; and (vi) Training a new generation of ocean and sea-ice observationalists and modelers. The most significant contributions are likely to be results of internationally coordinated development and analysis of modeling and observing at high and very high resolution; identification of uncertainties and errors and causes of these errors and model discrepancies, and recommendations for improvements of existing regional coupled ice-ocean models and Global Climate Models, by implementing new physics for Arctic processes."

Maintenance and repair of precision irrigation equipment, an important innovation that conserves water while enabling profitable farming in drought-ridden areas, requires advanced skills that students will develop as they work with state-of-the-art equipment. The use of drones and GPS makes it possible to identify and monitor problems that directly impact agricultural productivity, and drones also require very specialized maintenance and repair skills. The precision irrigation component of the project will support more efficient use of scarce water resources. Business owners and farmers will provide input into program and curriculum design by serving on the Ag Mechanics Advisory Committee. A formative and summative evaluation process will be employed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and deliverables.<br/><br/>This project is designed to develop a new Agricultural Mechanics (Ag Mechanics) program that will meet the growing need for education and training in installing, maintaining, diagnosing/troubleshooting, using, and repairing complex and integrated agricultural equipment. A multidisciplinary curriculum will focus on both traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered equipment and on new computer-driven technologies, including precision irrigation equipment, as well as drones and GPS for crop monitoring and mapping. The new program will consist of existing courses that are relevant to Ag Mechanics, existing courses that are modified to integrate new content, and newly created courses. A rich curriculum will serve students who plan to work in agriculture, both those working on family and commercial farms, and students preparing to become skilled technicians in service industries that repair, sell, and service farm equipment. Ag Mechanics will offer two certificates and an A.A.S. degree. Students who are interested in more advanced studies will be able to transfer to a four-year degree program in Agricultural Systems Technology at Utah State University. An important component of the project will be the development of a pathway program that connects high school students in agricultural courses to the Ag Mechanics program. College faculty will work with high school instructors to promote the pathway and develop a concurrent enrollment course in Ag Mechanics. Area high schools that participate in the pathway program will be able to provide their students with a broader educational experience. Because their high school classes are the beginning of a pathway that can lead to a certificate, a two-year degree, and a four-year baccalaureate degree, participating students will be motivated to complete high school and seek college-level education.  The program will provide a model for other technical colleges as the focus on both traditional and modern equipment is an approach that can be replicated at colleges throughout the nation. The multidisciplinary design, which combines existing courses with new and modified courses, is an excellent template for other small schools that lack the financial and human resources to create completely new curricula."

Using a standard experimental setting, the impact of weight on social processes is measured through an examination of influence.  In these experiments, differently weighted participants will work with their partner, dependent on the experimental condition, to complete two tasks. After considering their partner?s responses, each participant will submit a final group report in addition to their individual answers.  How often a participant accepts or rejects their partner?s answers allows for a measure of influence. It is hypothesized that the weight of the partner will directly impact measures of influence regardless of the weight of the participant.  <br/> <br/>The emerging field of fat studies suggests that fatness has negative social implications within American society which transcend racial, gender, and class categories; however, weight has not been explored as a status characteristic in the sociological social psychological literature. An examination of weight as a diffuse status characteristic will expand the sociological social psychological literature, specifically expectation states and status characteristic theories, as well as the emerging field of fat studies.  Greater theoretical understanding will enhance research on weight-based discrimination and group interactions. As reliance on groups grows, increased understanding of characteristics which influence group interactions is necessary. Results from the proposed study may lead to the creation and implementation of social interventions to reduce weight-based discrimination within diverse groups."

First, a diiridium catalyst supported by a chelating phosphorus (P)-nitrogen (N) ligand is being developed for formic acid dehydration. In related work, a series of iridium and ruthenium complexes containing bidentate, pyridine containing ligands are being developed as catalysts for the conversion of glycerol to lactic acid. Finally, ruthenium complexes containing a borate ligand are being designed for carbon dioxide reduction. The mechanisms of these processes are being determined by chemical, kinetic, and spectroscopic studies in order to optimize the catalytic processes.

However, it is difficult to deposit and transform nanoparticles into large two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures, such as thin films and discrete arrays, in a controlled manner.  This award supports fundamental research to enable a new additive manufacturing process to deposit nanoparticles into thin films or discrete nanodot arrays (a nanodot is a cluster of nanoparticles). The new process is versatile and scalable, and uses less materials and energy.  It can promote roll-to-roll manufacturing of a variety of energy and electronic devices such as conformal solar cells, sensors, and actuators.  It can also be used to fabricate masks for nanolithography, nanopillar arrays for photonic crystals, and nanodot arrays for plasmonic surfaces.<br/><br/>The new additive manufacturing process involves injecting silicon nanoparticles (contained inside electric field-driven water droplets) into a hollow laser beam. The size of nanoparticles ranges from 5 to 100 nm. The laser beam will heat the droplets, causing the water to evaporate and the nanoparticles to sinter and form microlayers on flexible substrates such as polyimide plastic (Kapton) or stainless steel foil. For this process to work, the laser beam needs to be focused so that its diameter is smaller than its wavelength. The droplet will serve as both a nanoparticle carrier, and a superlens that focuses a laser beam to subwavelength diameters. The dropsize has to be within an upper and lower critical limit. The first research objective is to determine these limits, and will be achieved through laser beam propagation modeling and droplet deposition experiments. The model involves numerical solution of Maxwell equations, and the solution yields the two limits. Several dropsizes will be chosen within these limits to conduct experiments. The size and feed rate of droplets will be measured using high speed photography; particle concentration using colloidal testing meter; the laser power, diameter, and pulse repetition rate using laser beam analyzer; the speed and temperature of substrate using substrate feed controller and thermography respectively. The grain size of the microlayer (determined by process variables) affects the electrical conductivity of the microlayer. The second research objective is to establish the relationship between the grain size and conductivity. It will be achieved by measuring the grain size using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the conductivity using four-probe technique."

One effective way of doing so is to prescribe a canonical metric for each object, namely a canonical way to measure the distance in an object. It is a classical result that each two dimensional surface carries a certain metric with constant curvature. For the three dimensional case, the problem becomes vastly more difficult. It was a much celebrated achievement of Perelman who successfully tackled the problem about ten years ago. He adopted an approach developed by Hamilton who has devised a way of deforming an arbitrary metric via a set of differential equations. A crucial step in understanding this set of equations for Perelman is to classify the so-called self-similar solutions. The current project aims to extend Perelman's work to dimension four and beyond. It is expected that the results will aid in the study of four dimensional spaces. <br/> <br/>Ricci solitons, as self-similar solutions to the Ricci flows, play a central role in the singularity analysis of the Ricci flows. The main theme of this project is to study shrinking Ricci solitons. In dimensions two and three, they have been completely classified. The classification has found important applications in the resolution of the Poincare and geometrization conjecture for three dimensional manifolds. The current project aims to obtain a classification for four dimensional complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons, building upon the recent progress including curvature estimates and a description of the structure at infinity. Another goal of the project is to lay some foundation toward a possible classification for high dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons."

Through enhanced partnerships with industry, it will address the annual shortage of educated professionals in the high-demand, high-paying field of CN in the service area of the college, the majority of which require a baccalaureate degree. The college will also develop articulation agreements with area high schools to help high school students transition seamlessly into the associate degree program. The project will also recruit and retain a more diverse student as it engages with local and national groups to get advice on increasing diversity in CN programs to increase the enrollment of underserved populations, women, and veterans in these programs.<br/><br/>By adopting the Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) best practice process and curricular resources created and refined by the ATE-funded National Convergence Technology Center (CTC) (DUE 1205077), the college will ensure that its AAS and BAS degrees provide students with the latest skills and knowledge they need to gain employment in the high-demand computer network field. The project will engage local employers, students, colleges, and high schools to develop a clear and achievable plan to upgrade the AAS, create a BAS, and develop articulated pathways from high school into CN programs that build on the experiences of other ATE-funded colleges. Activities will include curriculum and course development for two degrees, in-depth consultations with industry, extensive outreach to high school and college students and instructors, professional development for 20 area high school teachers, navigation of the approval processes, and creation of the infrastructure for the BAS program. The project will deeply engage employers to improve learning outcomes at the AAS level and build a BAS degree that will directly meet their need for baccalaureate level education in CN occupations.

This goal will be achieved by curriculum reform, where senior students will be exposed to three consecutive semesters of research experience including summer internships. These changes will allow for closer interactions among environmental science majors, and between students, faculty, and their future employers.  Taking advantage of the region's ""educational closed-loop"", seniors will further improve communication and collaboration skills through service-learning and community outreach, thus aiding in the recruitment of new majors.

Newton will target M dwarfs with measured rotation periods to investigate the relation between magnetism and rotation, and M and K dwarfs with measured radii to test whether magnetism can be responsible for the observed radius inflation. Finally, Newton will use information on the masses, metallicities, and ages of low-mass M dwarf planet-hosts to investigate the origins of multi-planet systems in compact orbits.

The study of these molecules may lead to a better understanding of how to design desirable properties as well as how these materials function. For example, the ability to control molecular conformations in conjugated monomers, oligomers, and polymers is not only important for manipulating their electronic properties, but also for optimization of the bulk electronic properties of a material. While free rotation within a material can lead to a variety of unpredictable, and perhaps undesirable, molecular packing arrangements, strategies for enforcing planarity can provide increased order and enhanced electronic properties. Arylene ethynylenes that are conformationally constrained are, therefore, important targets in the development of photovoltaic, thin-film transistor and light emitting devices. Similarly, with their rigidity and predictable geometries, arylene ethynylene structures can serve as hosts for guests of specific sizes and shapes. Complete understanding and optimization of the geometric parameters of these systems may lead to new sensing capabilities. Undergraduates responsible for synthesizing and characterizing these novel compounds gain hands-on experience in the laboratory, preparing them for careers in chemical industry or additional study in graduate programs.  This project is conducted on two different campuses, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and Missouri State University.  The participation of professors from these campuses in meaningful research enhances the education of not only the students working directly on the research projects, but also students who benefit from the transfer of knowledge and skills in the classroom.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of this project is to design and prepare novel arylene ethynylene structures with features that allow molecular level control over electronic properties, crystal design, and host-guest activity.

The PI intends to investigate fundamental mathematical problems concerning the dynamics of black holes in the context of the initial value problem for the celebrated Einstein equations. One of the most outstanding problems in this direction is the black hole stability conjecture, namely that black holes are indeed stable under perturbations from the outside. The resolution of this conjecture would underpin the relevance of black holes in the physical theory. Previous works of the PI uncovered a novel instability property of the so-called extremal black holes under a special class of perturbations. This instability has been further studied by several research groups worldwide both from the point of view of rigorous mathematics and numerics. The PI will strive to provide a complete description for the stability and instability properties of extremal black holes, obtaining in particular mathematically rigorous results for associated physical phenomena predicted by numerical simulations. The project will also investigate important global aspects of the Einstein equations including radiative properties of gravitational waves. Work on this proposal will improve our society's understanding of black holes, and consequently the structure of our universe. <br/><br/>The focus of the project is the study of three central problems relating to local and global properties of hyperbolic partial differential equations arising in general relativity. First, the project will investigate the stability problem for extremal and sub-extremal black holes. In this direction, the PI and his collaborators have developed a new method in the context of spherical symmetry which addresses various difficulties at the event horizon and null infinity and is expected to have a wide range of applications in hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The PI intends to extend this method and also obtain finer boundedness and decay properties of linear waves in order to obtain global results for the black hole stability problem. This project will probe various instabilities in the extremal case which originate from the convergence of non-axisymmetric quasinormal modes to finite values on the real axis and the coupling of the so-called trapping effect and superradiance. These phenomena are of fundamental importance in black hole dynamics and have been the object of extensive numerical simulations in the physics literature, but no rigorous results are presently available. Second, the project will investigate the gluing problem for characteristic initial data of hyperbolic equations, which is an extension of the Riemannian gluing problem, the latter being intensively studied in geometric analysis. Finally the project will develop a scattering theory for the Einstein equations which is expected to provide new insights into the global behavior of the Einstein equations and in particular the study of gravitational waves. The PI strongly believes that the proposal will lead to the discovery of genuinely new analytical techniques applicable in a wider spectrum of problems in geometry, analysis, PDEs and mathematical physics."

All these services are essentially organized as complex distributed software systems.  When such a system encounters a failure (a service outage or an unexpected performance problem), the potential costs of the failure can quickly reach millions of dollars in lost revenue or lost productivity.  Diagnosing the root causes of the problem quickly and restoring the service as soon as possible are both critical.<br/><br/>The basic approach to this problem is to record (or ""log"") information frequently as system components execute and interact, and then to analyze these logs after a failure in attempting to diagnose the root causes.  While these analyses use increasingly sophisticated statistical and machine-learning based techniques, they are limited by the information gathered in the logs: the state-of-the-art approaches today record limited information pertaining to major events so that they do not slow down the services significantly during normal operation.  In particular, these systems do not record detailed internal information within components or detailed network traffic between components that can be enormously useful in diagnosing failures more quickly.<br/><br/>This project develops new techniques that make it possible to reconstruct this missing information by leveraging recent advances in program analysis and automated testing.  Moreover, the project develops a new strategy that breaks down the reconstruction task into small steps that will allow the analysis to scale to very large distributed services.  The project also develops new, more sophisticated analysis techniques for individual components that go beyond the current state-of-the-art, by tailoring them to the specific problems faced in this work.  The project engages industrial partners to evaluate the techniques on their systems, and makes the resulting software solutions available in open source form to the research community as well as the industrial partners.

It will prepare and support 25 physics, chemistry, and mathemtics majors to become highly qualified secondary education candidates for teaching positions in high-need school districts in Pennsylvania. Project objectives are to: recruit, retain, and graduate the Noyce scholars; to ensure they benefit from innovative best practices in STEM pedagogy; and to ensure they develop cultural competencies and the preparation needed to successfully teach in rural or urban high-need classrooms. The project emphasizes instructional practices that engage learners in inquiry-based learning activities and provides relevant and significant field experiences. An important component of the project is the emphasis placed on promoting cultural competencies related to linguistic, cultural, and economic diversity. Candidates develop these competencies through field placements, cultural immersion, and add-on certification as English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Specialists. Upon graduation and employment in Pennsylvania schools, Noyce scholars will be provided on-going mentorship through site visits and alumni retreats. <br/><br/>The Susquehanna University Noyce project will prepare the physics, chemistry, and mathematics majors through the following: An internship program that provides these pre-service teacher candidates with early teaching experiences incorporating systematic reflection, mentoring, and constructive feedback; field experiences that provide cross-cultural immersion in high-need rural or urban communities and are supported through systematic critical reflection; field experiences that prepare the candidates for working in economically, culturally, and linguistically diverse classrooms; courses that include best pedagogical practices for diverse classrooms, and optional ESL certification. In addition, the STEM educational methods courses will model and prepare candidates to utilize instructional activities characterized by inquiry, experimentation, collaboration, and interdisciplinary learning. Finally, during student teaching, Noyce scholars will complete action research capstone projects on their instructional practices. Data will be systematically collected on each element of the Noyce Scholars project, as well as on the holistic experience of Noyce scholars, to assess individual and cumulative consequences. Ultimately, the project will prepare STEM teachers with a sophisticated understanding of diverse and underserved students' learning needs and deep knowledge about their content area and effective pedagogical approaches. Teachers who possess strong content knowledge, employ engaging instructional practices, and understand students and their communities promote greater student academic achievement and sustained interest than those lacking one or more of these capacities. When learners from underserved communities view their teachers as community members and/or invested in their communities, they are more likely to see themselves as capable of pursuing similar academic and professional paths. This project has the potential to positively impact surrounding high-need communities by increasing academic achievement, STEM engagement, and subsequent interest in postsecondary education and/or STEM-related careers. In turn, these project outcomes hold potential to expand the knowledge-base regarding the preparation of teachers to succeed in such high-need school districts. Susquehanna University has a commitment to actively recruit Noyce scholars from historically underserved populations (minority, low-income, and first-generation students) in order to increase the presence of relatable role models in mathematics and science."

These typically depend upon many parameters and vary randomly on a small scale. In addition, often the available information (e.g., data used in weather prediction) is not exact (deterministic) but statistical (random), with large fluctuations. On macroscopic scales that are much larger than the ones of the heterogeneities, the models often exhibit an effective deterministic behavior, which is much simpler than the original one. The process of averaging such data is known as homogenization. Mathematically, this means that the original random problem is replaced by a deterministic one. When this averaging is not possible, which is typically the case when the fluctuations are too strong (wild), it is necessary to deal with so-called stochastic media (stochastic partial differential equations), which have rather singular behavior in space and time.  The mathematical study of both the stochastic averaging and the stochastic partial differential equations requires original ideas and the development of new methodologies, since both topics fall outside the traditional theories of averaging and partial differential equations.  Another burgeoning area of research in which similar issues surface is mathematical biology, where experiments at the molecular scale, as well as theoretical advances, have led to new, sophisticated mathematical models. Novel tools and ideas are needed to study these problems further and to validate all the relevant regimes/scales of the parameters affecting the experimentally observed and theoretically conjectured behaviors. <br/><br/>This project is directed at the development of general methodologies to study random homogenization, nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations, and applications to front propagation, phase transitions, and mathematical biology. Random environments are much more general than periodic ones. The latter basically involve fixed translations of a certain equation, whereas the former can be thought of as involving all possible (relevant) equations. This leads to considerable issues concerning the lack of compactness. It is therefore necessary to develop novel arguments that combine both the differential and random structures of the media under scrutiny. In this setting, the equation is the random variable and the special dependence signifies the location in space where the equation is observed. The principal investigator and his collaborators were the first to consider stochastic homogenization in stationary ergodic environments. A large part of the project is dedicated to further development of the theory.  Stochastic partial differential equations have coefficients with very singular (Brownian) behavior. In the linear context, this can usually be handled by known methods, such as the classical martingale approach. This method is based on the linear character of the higher order part of the equation and thus cannot be used for nonlinear problems, where it is necessary to find appropriate alternative notions of solutions. These, in the context of first- and second-order nonlinear equations, are the stochastic viscosity and pathwise entropy solutions that have been introduced by the principal investigator and his collaborators.  A part of the project is the study of the qualitative behavior/properties of these solutions. In the context of mathematical biology, the principal investigator plans to work on models of adaptation/selection as well as on models of the biology of development. The former concerns questions related to the adaptation of species to global change, the resistance of insects to pesticides, etc. The latter aims at developing models to study how positional information is provided to proliferating cells, the main questions being the formation and location of sharp and precise boundaries."

The first one is to synthesize covalently-linked aggregates of two or more single-molecule magnets (SMMs) linked by dioximate or dicarboxylate bridges and to study their magnetic and quantum physics properties. Weak interactions between the SMMs leads to quantum superposition/entanglement states.  These nebulous and fragile effects are detected and studied with techniques such as high-frequency electron paramagnetic (HFEPR) spectroscopy in the solid state. Extension of the HFEPR studies to frozen solutions is crucial to determine if structures and quantum effects remain unchanged on dissolution, providing a second phase for their study. The second objective is the preparation of molecules with a Mnx/O (x = 8-12) cage-like structures containing a heterometal M' of a different type (M' = Ca, La, Ln, Bi, Pb, etc.) at their center.

Nanofibers (NF) are increasingly explored in high performance filtration, batteries and fuel cells, wound healing, composite material reinforcements, blood vessel and tissue engineering, smart textiles, drug delivery, gas sensors, electronics, and catalysis. The global market for NF is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 35% between 2014 and 2020 and reach ~$1 billion by 2017.  There are huge needs in the development of sizeable and ?green? production of NF from a larger range of materials, providing easier ways for NF processing into functional structures, and developing a skilled workforce.  This IRES will provide at least 18 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with unique hands-on experience and significant knowledge of cutting-edge NF fabrication methods, as well as NF testing and application by providing an intense research program at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in catalysis and bio-fuels in Poland. Students will develop practical skills needed to address the knowledge gaps in NF science and technology, bring their experiences back to their home institutions, and help to develop a global-capable workforce for this emerging market.

Nanofibers (NF) form a large class of materials that can exhibit nano-enabled unique properties, which are unattainable at a larger scale.  However, the growth potential of the NF materials market is still hindered by the limited ability to efficiently generate sizeable quantities of nanofibers with predictable and controllable complex, macroscopic architectures and desirable properties.  Students will work at TUL with a new, high-rate, alternating-current electrospinning (ac-electrospinning) process that unveils several new physical phenomena which help to overcome major disadvantages of commonly used dc-electrospinning, such as ?whipping? instability and residual electric charge, while increasing the process productivity by 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude. Students will explore selected NF-based materials for advanced catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity and stability in many reactions at UT-Lodz, along with other applications tested at TUL.  During the pre-trip training, foreign site work, and post-trip activities, students will focus on advancing basic understanding of all aspects of emerging high-rate ac-electrospinning, in order to direct the assembly of NF into desired configurations and to stimulate the development of commercializable processes for nanofiber-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis, biomedical uses, and other potential applications.  Overall, this program shall facilitate a broader long-term collaboration between the US and international research groups within the nanofiber research and manufacturing domain by bringing new collaborators and facilitating multiple international links between the researchers and students in related areas."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising interdisciplinary scholar in order to expand the Fellow's experience beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and focus on a key psychological problem of broad interest and importance. The Fellow will study how people develop social capital-the collected resources available through relationships with other people.  Examples of social capital include loans, jobs, time, and advice. Social capital proffers crucial advantages to individuals, but economically disadvantaged people often also suffer from poor access to social capital, limiting their social mobility. Little is known about psychological processes that lead to these disparities. In this work, the fellow will generate a laboratory model of social capital inequality, and test an intervention to increase equitable social capital. In doing so, this research will draw from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and sociology, crossing traditional disciplinary lines to characterize how people learn about one another and develop social capital. By characterizing and ameliorating disparities in social capital, the proposal may offer benefits to individuals and society as a whole. By developing an interdisciplinary approach, this project offers new insights to several fields, promoting scientific progress.  <br/><br/>This project develops a subfield at the intersection of several disciplines: instrumental social learning, or the study of how people learn about others through interaction. This subfield can offer new insights to its parent fields of cognitive neuroscience and social psychology, and can link individual psychology to sociological patterns. First, the proposed work will test how people form impressions of one another during interaction and how interactions influence later decisions to help others. By examining how people learn about others through active experience, this project links impression formation to decision-making and to neural models of reward-based learning. Second, the proposed work highlights the fact that people learn by experiencing the valuable social qualities of other people, such as generosity, in addition to learning about material benefits others bring to the self. Third, the present proposal will test whether social psychological interventions shape reward-based learning, which has most often been studied in isolation of social context. Finally, these findings would tie psychological processes of learning and decision-making within individuals to broad sociological patterns of social capital, linking social cognition ""down"" to neural models of learning and ""up"" to societal-level outcomes. The proposed research links disparities in social capital to the way in which individuals learn about one another through interaction, examining how people build social ties that can promote reciprocity. Specifically, the current research tests whether people reciprocate more with others who bring them material rewards through interaction, above and beyond those who display positive character traits and intentions (Experiments 1 and 2). In addition, the present proposal tests a social psychological intervention (empathic mindsets) to shape patterns of reward-based learning (Experiment 3). To propagate the impact of this research, the Fellow will disseminate findings to the scientific community through journals and conferences, and to the public through science communication outlets. To facilitate the development of interdisciplinary science, the Fellow will create quantitative tools for researchers in social psychology to use computational models of social learning and decision-making."

Being able to provide points that look random, statistically, is extremely important both from applied and pure points of view. An illustration of the importance of the task is given by secure communications, such as bank transfers and other electronic commerce, which start with a scheme that picks a random pair of prime numbers from the collection of all primes of an appropriate size. Being sufficiently random is one of the requirements that keeps many such schemes secure. However, providing a random point from a pool of points is a computational task that is much harder than it might seem.  This research project studies mathematical questions underpinning the random choice of elements of a set.  One of the main aims of this project is to establish that, if the group of symmetries of a collection of points is complicated enough, then one can provide a pseudo-random point rather quickly, compared to the number of points. The main focus of this project is to develop a very concrete way of measuring how complicated a group is by using polynomial equations. As part of the project, the investigator plans to explore some of its applications to pure mathematics, for example, generalizations of the work on sum and product sets that says: given a finite set of integers, the collection of all possible pairwise sums, and, the collection of all possible pairwise products, these collections cannot both be small. <br/><br/>The principal aim of this project is to prove the main conjecture of super-approximation and explore its applications to the other areas of mathematics. Super-approximation roughly says: whether a random walk (with respect to finitely many elements with algebraic entries) in invertible matrices over some topological ring, e.g., real numbers, p-adic numbers, or adeles, has spectral gap depends only on the Zariski closure of the group generated by the given set of matrices. In the past decade there has been substantial progress in this subject, and super-approximation has been shown to be extremely useful in various parts of mathematics, including number theory (affine sieve; variations of Galois representations) and group theory (sieve in groups; hyperbolic geometry; orbit equivalence rigidity). Another goal of this project is to find additional applications of super-approximation."

While various remediation methods have been developed, they all face a common challenge that the groundwater environment is complex and cannot be fully understood and characterized with limited amount of time and resources. Hence, given the uncertainty in the characterization of the groundwater environment, the challenge is to design a remediation strategy that has the maximum probability of success or equivalently the minimum probability of failure. A common reason for remediation failure is ignoring model uncertainty. Using a single model for remediation design may lead to overconfidence in the predictive capability of the model and thus to increased probability of failure. The proposed research will reexamine the problem of remediation design under model uncertainty by using a multimodel-based data-worth analysis. In other words, multiple models are used to identify and guide the collection of the most valuable data for model evaluation, improvement, and reconstruction. Because of the synthesis between models, remediation designs, and data, the proposed multimodel data-worth analysis for remediation design will provide a transformative platform for scientists, engineers, and decision-makers to systematically investigate all components involved in groundwater remediation. This project will also provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of hydrology, computational science, and civil engineering. In addition, the project will engage high school teachers and students in summer schools to gain laboratory and computational experience for understanding the concepts of groundwater contaminant transport and remediation.     <br/><br/>The proposed research has two objectives: to reformulate data-worth analysis for groundwater remediation with consideration of model uncertainty, and to break computational barriers between models and model analysis needed for remediation design. To achieve the first objective, a data-worth analysis will be integrated into a framework of multimodel analysis (also known as model averaging), which will be developed into a new procedure for remediation design that will be compatible with the multimodel data-worth analysis. To achieve the second objective, an accurate but cheap-to-evaluate surrogate of the models will be developed and then used for the data-worth analysis and remediation design under uncertainty. The Bayesian approaches (theoretical and computational) will be used for achieving both the objectives. While the proposed method of multimodel Bayesian data-worth analysis is general and can be applied to any remediation method, it will be integrated with the recently developed engineered injection and extraction method, a promising technique for in-situ remediation. The proposed methods will be evaluated in a two-prong strategy using synthetic and real-world modeling problems. The real-world problem involves uranium contamination at the Naturita Site, Colorado, and nitrogen contamination at the Indian River County, Florida. The synthetic study will mimic the real-world problem to the extent possible so that insights gained from the synthetic study can be used directly for the real-world modeling. This project will provide scientific support for on-going environmental remediation and monitoring at the two field sites as well as other contaminated sites.<br/>"

As part of Binghamton University's Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program, a team of five science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty across the geology, biology and environmental studies disciplines are using the multi- disciplinary field of biogeochemistry to engage students early in their college years in research applicable to geoscience careers. Biogeochemistry investigates the interconnection of biological, geological, and chemical processes. Modern and ancient lake and ocean sediments, the atmosphere, watersheds and wetlands provide field sites and samples for the biogeochemistry research. The biogeochemistry research stream consists of a three course sequence: 1) a research methods course during the fall semester, 2) followed by training in analytical techniques during the spring semester that 3) culminates in completion of a research project the following fall.  Funding is being provided for some of the FRI students to engage in hands-on, outdoor, field based components of their research projects during the summer between the spring and fall. This approach allows students to develop projects that incorporate and evaluate seasonality components critical to the understanding of many biogeochemical processes.  As a part of the outreach program, high school educators and several of their students participate in a summer workshop where they learn about FRI opportunities through direct interaction with the FRI students, faculty and staff. In turn, the FRI students and their achievements are being used to develop an outreach program that includes visits to high schools and community colleges. Consequently, this program is working to increase the numbers and diversity of students trained in Geosciences, thus meeting a crucial national need within a STEM discipline.<br/><br/><br/>The Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program is supporting a cohort of 25-30 Biogeochemistry students each year. The biogeochemistry experience begins with a research methods course that emphasizes quantitative reasoning, scientific communication and a semester-long literature review to identify research topics in biogeochemistry. The first half of the spring semester, students learn analytical techniques applicable to biogeochemistry research; by the second half of the spring, they begin their research project. In the fall of sophomore year, students have an entire second semester to continue working on their research project. The biogeochemistry stream has a dedicated laboratory equipped for research, and a PhD-trained research educator who oversees the students, graduate teaching assistant and undergraduate peer mentors.  The FRI program features a combination of the multiple components. A team of faculty members with well-established research programs designs and oversees the freshman research themes.  The research themes explicitly address core concepts and core skills of the geosciences.  The participating freshmen develop electronic-portfolios documenting their research experiences and understanding of the process of science, which they build upon throughout their college years.  Students take a sequence of courses that emphasize teamwork, thus provides explicit training to undergraduates on how to work in research teams.  The students are exposed to interdisciplinary research (IDR) and engage in multiple opportunities to develop IDR skills. The biogeochemistry research projects generate spin-off research modules that are being infused into other courses; as a result, authentic research experiences eventually will be provided in regular science courses, contributing to improved engagement, learning and retention in the sciences. The undergraduates' research activities are expected to result in students being co-authors of presentations and peer-reviewed articles. Assessment activities are documenting the impacts of the stepped, multi-mentored research experience of the FRI program for undergraduates considering a career in geosciences."

Models estimate that the Ross Sea sector was one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise from Antarctica as the ice sheet adjusted during the past ten thousand years from the glacial period to the Holocene. In this sector, ice flow into the embayment comes through West Antarctic ice streams and through East Antarctic outlet glaciers that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains. Observational data constrain the last glacial maximum and the Holocene retreat, but models are necessary to understand the environmental conditions needed for outlet glaciers to reach observed high stands, to fit the observed patterns of retreat, and to understand how the contribution of ice from West Antarctica and from East Antarctica changed over time.<br/><br/>The investigators will use available geological and geophysical data in combination with forward ice-flow models and inverse models to investigate the evolution of the four Transantarctic outlet glaciers where sufficient data exist. The objectives of this new modeling are to constrain the glaciological conditions necessary for these glaciers to thicken during the last glacial, thin during the Holocene, and reach their present-day state. By testing specific hypotheses this work contributes to an interdisciplinary effort to understand Holocene deglaciation of the Ross Sea Embayment. In addition, the modeling will address the resolving power of the available data to answer key questions for each target glacier. Broader impacts include mentoring a graduate student, public outreach, incorporation of research into high-school and university classes, and support of an early-career investigator."

Earth Science was not previously a required course in the State curriculum, and Iowa high schools must now meet the challenge of achieving NGSS Earth Science proficiency objectives in a state with very few K-12 educators certified or endorsed in Earth Science. What few Iowa high schools do teach Earth Science typically present it as a 'remedial science' instead of as the integration and application of all of the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. The recent adoption of NGSS in the State, the critical need to train K-12 educators statewide in Earth Science, and the need to incorporate more rigor in the presentation of Earth Science provide an opportunity to reframe Earth Science education in Iowa as the capstone STEM discipline. Improving Earth Science education in the state has potential to significantly increase the exposure of students to Earth Science at an early stage and improve their awareness of the field as an interdisciplinary STEM discipline and potential career path. High school students who become interested in Earth Science must also have opportunities for engagement and professional preparation as they matriculate to colleges and universities if they are eventually to transition successfully into an Earth Science career and help to rebuild the aging geoscience workforce. This project addresses reform of Earth Science education statewide through a series of collaborative partnerships between the University of Iowa, Kirkwood Community College, and the Iowa Geological Survey. Targeted activities follow National Research Council recommendations for Preparing the Next Generation of Earth Scientists and are aimed specifically at the K-12, community college, four-year university, and professional geoscientist levels to dramatically improve the opportunities and outcomes for student awareness of, engagement with, and professional preparation for a potential career in geoscience.<br/><br/>This project is working to dramatically reshape geoscience education in the State of Iowa through four mechanisms: 1) directly funding teacher training and re-certification courses through continuing education credits; 2) developing and disseminating K-12 course content materials for NGSS Earth Science content in the classroom; 3) engaging undecided and early career undergraduate students at the University of Iowa and Kirkwood Community College in the geosciences, through a series of field trip experiences and independent research opportunities; and, 4) providing internship opportunities as professional preparation for students who intend to pursue a career in the Earth Sciences. This project focuses on the critical transitions from K-12 to college, community college to four-year university, and university to the geoscience workforce. This integrated and systemic approach to strengthen Earth Science education has the potential to transform Earth Science education in the State of Iowa, as well as establish a model for effective implementation of the NGSS Earth Science components that may have utility in other states that have adopted the NGSS. By the end of the three year project, a total of 225 K-12 teachers will receive continuing education credits, more than 350 community college and four-year college undergraduate students will engage in a series of geoscience field trip courses, and 45 undergraduate students will participate in mentored research/internship opportunities."

Of the almost 1,400 survey respondents, 62% stated that their organizations have too few information security professionals, which is a 6% increase from their 2013 survey. This shortfall is serious and estimated to reach 1.5 million security practitioners by 2020. This project entitled Cyber Service at Union County College (UCC) in New Jersey is designed to address this critical cybersecurity workforce shortage of the nation. The innovative curricular design focuses on the education of middle skill cyber forensics technicians. Experiential education and service learning are integrated into the curriculum to keep students engaged, to provide critical workforce readiness skills, and to instill a commitment to community service. By incorporating a community-based, service-learning capstone experience into the associate-degree program. Cyber Service is designed to advance a diverse group of students prepared to enter the well-paying industry of cyber forensics as middle-skilled technicians. The project plans for least 35% of students in the program to be identified as belonging to a population traditionally under-represented in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields (e.g., female, African American, and Hispanics). Cyber Service has great potential to serve as a national model for other community colleges.  National dissemination of curricular and service-learning materials specifically developed for cyber forensics technicians is planned through the National CyberWatch Center, ATE Central, ATE TV, and the Association for Computing Machinery Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (ACM CCECC), as well as national cyber education and experiential education conferences.<br/> <br/>Cyber Service will address the urgent need to increase the pool of skilled cyber forensics technicians to fill high-demand jobs by employers in the northern New Jersey and New York City metropolitan region, and to improve student retention and persistence in the attainment of post-secondary credentials while preparing graduates with 21st century career ready skills. The project will adapt four digital forensics courses from the NSF ATE Advanced Cyberforensics Education (ACE) consortium. Cyber Service will then extend the work of ACE by creating three new courses that complement the consortium courses and by integrating innovative experiential education and service-learning throughout the program courses. The three new courses are 1) cloud computing and mobile device forensics, 2) cyber law and ethics, and 3) service-learning cyber capstone. The expert project team will develop a series of embedded, stackable certificates designed to culminate in an associate of applied science degree in cyber forensics investigations that is mapped to federal standards. Upon completion of the associate degree, students will be well prepared to sit for industry certification exams appropriate to cyber forensics, such the AccessData Certified Examiner. The new Cyber Capstone is a culminating course that allows students to demonstrate their interdisciplinary knowledge and technical skills learned in both the adopted and newly developed courses, as well as to build 21st century career-ready abilities and civic responsibilities through service-learning field experiences with community partners.  An extensive evaluation, based on the Program Evaluation Standards of the American Evaluation Association,is planned to ensure that the project documents its achievements and improves it effectiveness relative to student success and employer satisfaction."

Large energy density fluctuations can cause the nucleation of bubbles of a new phase in the early universe, which could play a role in the evolution of the universe. These fluctuations can also alter the gravitational field and influence the propagation of light rays. This is an effect of quantum gravity, and its study will help to elucidate the relation between quantum theory and relativity theory, which is one of the unsolved problems of theoretical physics. The project will also study analog models for quantum gravity involving nonlinear optics, and the results may lead to a deeper understanding of optics, as well as quantum gravity.

One approach to be used is an analog model in which squared electric field vacuum fluctuations in a nonlinear dielectric cause light speed fluctuations. This effect can give useful insights into quantum gravity effects, and is of interest in its own right and might be  experimentally observable.

Professor Flowers and his students are examining the mechanism for reactions of samarium (II) iodide (SmI2), a widely used reagent in organic synthesis.  The first goal of this project is designed to examine the role of proton donors (alcohols and water) on the reactivity and efficiency of reactions and determine whether electrons and protons are transferred in sequential steps, or whether the process is concerted and occurs through a formal hydrogen atom transfer.  The second goal of this project is to use the mechanistic information from studies on SmI2-proton donor systems to develop catalytic reactions. Students at the undergraduate and graduate level receive training in a range of scientific techniques.  Outreach to elementary students leads to sustained engagement with the local community.  Finally, video recordings of experimental protocols developed during these studies are freely disseminated on the Flowers research group webpage to assist scientists who use reagents based on SmI2.     <br/><br/>SmI2 is among the most widely employed reagents that reduce substrates and reactive intermediates through single electron transfer.  Although most reactions of SmI2 require proton donors, the mechanism of this reagent combination is not fully understood and the current view is that reductions and reductive coupling reactions proceed through a sequential electron-transfer, proton-transfer processes.  This work tests the hypothesis that reductions and reductive coupling reactions proceed through a formal hydrogen atom transfer and that the coupled transfer of an electron and proton is responsible for the unique reactivity of Sm(II)-coordinating proton donor reductions of substrates which are typically recalcitrant to reduction through single electron transfer.  As mechanistic work on Sm(II)-proton donors systems is performed, data obtained from these studies is used for the development of useful and user-friendly catalytic reactions; a longstanding, but elusive goal in this field.  Integration of a range of experimental techniques along with synthetic applications of proton-coupled, electron-transfer in synthesis provides a dynamic intellectual environment for students at all levels of study. The educational plan includes long-term engagement with local elementary schools designed to nurture greater interest in science.  Finally, as research is published in peer-reviewed journals, video recordings of all experimental protocols are made to aid scientists who want to repeat the reaction protocols."

While various remediation methods have been developed, they all face a common challenge that the groundwater environment is complex and cannot be fully understood and characterized with limited amount of time and resources. Hence, given the uncertainty in the characterization of the groundwater environment, the challenge is to design a remediation strategy that has the maximum probability of success or equivalently the minimum probability of failure. A common reason for remediation failure is ignoring model uncertainty. Using a single model for remediation design may lead to overconfidence in the predictive capability of the model and thus to increased probability of failure. The proposed research will reexamine the problem of remediation design under model uncertainty by using a multimodel-based data-worth analysis. In other words, multiple models are used to identify and guide the collection of the most valuable data for model evaluation, improvement, and reconstruction. Because of the synthesis between models, remediation designs, and data, the proposed multimodel data-worth analysis for remediation design will provide a transformative platform for scientists, engineers, and decision-makers to systematically investigate all components involved in groundwater remediation. This project will also provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of hydrology, computational science, and civil engineering. In addition, the project will engage high school teachers and students in summer schools to gain laboratory and computational experience for understanding the concepts of groundwater contaminant transport and remediation.     <br/><br/>The proposed research has two objectives: to reformulate data-worth analysis for groundwater remediation with consideration of model uncertainty, and to break computational barriers between models and model analysis needed for remediation design. To achieve the first objective, a data-worth analysis will be integrated into a framework of multimodel analysis (also known as model averaging), which will be developed into a new procedure for remediation design that will be compatible with the multimodel data-worth analysis. To achieve the second objective, an accurate but cheap-to-evaluate surrogate of the models will be developed and then used for the data-worth analysis and remediation design under uncertainty. The Bayesian approaches (theoretical and computational) will be used for achieving both the objectives. While the proposed method of multimodel Bayesian data-worth analysis is general and can be applied to any remediation method, it will be integrated with the recently developed engineered injection and extraction method, a promising technique for in-situ remediation. The proposed methods will be evaluated in a two-prong strategy using synthetic and real-world modeling problems. The real-world problem involves uranium contamination at the Naturita Site, Colorado, and nitrogen contamination at the Indian River County, Florida. The synthetic study will mimic the real-world problem to the extent possible so that insights gained from the synthetic study can be used directly for the real-world modeling. This project will provide scientific support for on-going environmental remediation and monitoring at the two field sites as well as other contaminated sites.<br/>"

Geiger of the University of Vermont is studying electrochemistry in addressing chemical, biochemical, and environmental problems. The most common type of electrochemical cell is one in which two metal electrodes communicate through an electrolyte solution, with chemical reactions taking place at each electrode. Traditionally, the electrodes have been composed of expensive and rare metals such as platinum and gold. In the interest of both cost and sustainability, these traditional metals need to be replaced by cheaper and more common, preferably carbon-based, materials. However, carbon surfaces themselves lack the chemical structure needed to carry out many important reactions, such as those required in efficient fuel cells. The project is designed to molecularly alter the surface structure of carbon, thereby increasing the efficiency of these reactions. These studies provide training in electrochemistry and transition-metal chemistry for undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to high school students. The students are also experiencing other research groups through a number of collaborating arrangements. <br/><br/>Professor Geiger is developing a new chemical electrode modification method based on electrochemical oxidation of either an ethynyl-containing molecule or a metal-activated ethynyl molecule. An ethynyl group provides a nearly ideal linkage between a molecular substrate and a carbon surface owing to its ability to offer facile electronic communication between those moieties, its very strong bonding to the surface, and its structural integrity. Both organometallic molecules and porphyrin complexes containing transition metals are being attached to the electrode surfaces. Routes to electrode modification by porphyrins containing a number of different transition metals are being be explored, and one or more electrocatalytic reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, are being probed. Electrodes also are being modified with ethynyl-linked metal photosensitizers and ethynyl-linked multi-electron transfer agents, with the goal of providing new electrode surfaces for efficient biosensors and neural sensors. A new approach to analysis of chemically modified electrodes by magnetic circular dichroism is being studied."

Mixing due to motion of a liquid or gaseous medium in which reactive processes occur is frequently an important component in their dynamics, and is also relevant to other processes, such as reliable manufacturing of glasses and alloys. This motion may be subject to fluid turbulence, the effects of which are of paramount importance in many areas of physics and engineering. The central aim of this project is a better understanding of the long term behavior of these physical processes through the analytical study of their mathematical models, which are expressed in the form of partial differential equations. The main questions addressed will be the question of dependence of the speed of spreading of reactive processes on the properties and structure of combustive media in which they occur; the question of how an underlying mixing process can enhance this speed and which types of mixing are most efficient at achieving this; and the question of spontaneous development of turbulence and unexpected singular behaviors in the motion of fluids. The goal is to obtain mathematically rigorous results which can also shed further light on the dynamical behavior of the actual physical processes being modeled. <br/><br/>This research project studies mathematical models of several important physical processes, which include reactive processes, fluid dynamics, and mixing. The models are given by linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations, transport equations, and equations of fluid dynamics. The main interest is in the long term dynamics of their solutions as well as in the formation of singularities. The goal of the reaction-diffusion portion of the project is the understanding and description of long term dynamics of reactive processes spreading through inhomogeneous media in one and several dimensions, including existence of traveling fronts, asymptotic convergence of general solutions to them, and homogenization of solutions in random media. The goal of the mixing portion of the project is the study of mixing efficiency of flows and the search for those which are best at mixing substances advected by them. The goal of the fluid dynamics portion of the project is the study of turbulence, particularly creation of small scales and finite time singularity formation in models of fluid and atmospheric motion in two dimensions. Another goal of the research is the study of active combustion, where all three of these processes come together due to a direct feedback of the reaction on fluid motion via the buoyancy force. Models incorporating such feedback involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations, and the focus will be on existence and stability of traveling fronts and on gravity-induced mixing. To address these questions, the research will make use of techniques recently developed by the investigator and collaborators, as well as the development of new methods capable of further advancing understanding of the dynamical behavior of reactive processes."

The study of these molecules may lead to a better understanding of how to design desirable properties as well as how these materials function. For example, the ability to control molecular conformations in conjugated monomers, oligomers, and polymers is not only important for manipulating their electronic properties, but also for optimization of the bulk electronic properties of a material. While free rotation within a material can lead to a variety of unpredictable, and perhaps undesirable, molecular packing arrangements, strategies for enforcing planarity can provide increased order and enhanced electronic properties. Arylene ethynylenes that are conformationally constrained are, therefore, important targets in the development of photovoltaic, thin-film transistor and light emitting devices. Similarly, with their rigidity and predictable geometries, arylene ethynylene structures can serve as hosts for guests of specific sizes and shapes. Complete understanding and optimization of the geometric parameters of these systems may lead to new sensing capabilities. Undergraduates responsible for synthesizing and characterizing these novel compounds gain hands-on experience in the laboratory, preparing them for careers in chemical industry or additional study in graduate programs.  This project is conducted on two different campuses, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and Missouri State University.  The participation of professors from these campuses in meaningful research enhances the education of not only the students working directly on the research projects, but also students who benefit from the transfer of knowledge and skills in the classroom.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of this project is to design and prepare novel arylene ethynylene structures with features that allow molecular level control over electronic properties, crystal design, and host-guest activity.  Specifically, incorporation of pyridinyl groups within conjugated systems offers an opportunity for structural control via halogen bonding, hydrogen bonding, and transition metal coordination.  These interactions provide avenues for the generation of novel liquid crystals, the enhanced effective conjugation of unsaturated backbones, and highly specific host-guest pairing."

Because the field is concerned with the development of tools for analyzing, organizing, and arranging discrete data, combinatorial methods are essential in many scientific areas such as genomics, computer science, statistics, and physics. The methods can often be traced back to research inspired by problems in algebra and geometry. For example, the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is based on a combinatorial result in modular arithmetic. This research project is devoted to developing combinatorial techniques for attacking problems that connect to algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, a subject with applications to probability and statistical mechanics. The investigation will make use of a computational symbolic algebra system and will further develop the SAGE open-source mathematics software suite. <br/><br/>This research project spans combinatorial problems in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and physics. The inspiration comes from the central importance of constructions such as tableaux and Bruhat posets in the classical studies of representations of the complex linear group and Schubert calculus. The precision of combinatorics is carried to more abstract problems by a distinguished Schur basis for the algebra of symmetric functions. The project concerns variations on the classical theories that address subtle questions about geometric Gromov-Witten invariants, symmetric functions over a field of parameters, bi-graded representations, and quantum integrable systems. A priority is to develop the necessary combinatorial framework for the contemporary set of problems. The venture goes hand in hand with an investigation of refined physical, geometric, and algebraic theories attached to the combinatorics. The resulting combinatorial constructions will lend computational facility to related application areas."

The ever increasing demand for electric power has created congestion on the current power grid. There is an urgent need for a new way of increasing the capacity of current transmission lines. This award supports fundamental research to enable manufacturing of transformative aluminum electrical conductors enhanced by nanoparticles. These conductors can offer superior power transmission capacity with a high operating temperature limit, and significantly reduce construction costs and increase reliability of future power transmission grids. They can also be used for other renewable energy and energy storage systems. <br/><br/>The first research objective is to establish relationships between electron scattering effects of nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in aluminum substrates and the material type, size, shape, and volume percentage of the nanoparticles. To achieve this objective, both theoretical and experimental studies will be conducted.  Mathematical equations of electron scattering by nanoparticles will be developed by examining electron transport at different size scales, and will be used to predict electrical conductivity of aluminum nanocomposites. A standard 4-point probe will be used to measure the electrical conductivity of aluminum conductors containing 0.1-10 vol percent spherical nanoparticles (such as TiB2) with a size of 5-60 nm.  Some predicted values of electrical conductivity will be compared against measured values. The second research objective is to determine the interaction potentials (interfacial energy, van der Waals potential, and thermal energy) among nanoparticles (such as TiB2, TiC, and Ti5Si3) and molten aluminum. To achieve this objective, analytical models based on intermolecular interactions will be established while experimental measurements will be carried out using the sessile-drop method and atomic force microscope.  The third research objective is to establish relationships among properties (tensile strength, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity), microstructure (phase, nanoparticle dispersion, and size and morphology of grains), and manufacturing process parameters for aluminum nanocomposites.  Solidification processing of aluminum nanocomposites will be assisted by a molten salt method. Nanocomposite ingots will be cold drawn into wires. Tensile testing on the nanocomposite wires will be conducted. Thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the nanocomposite will be measured using the laser flash method and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively.

The group will also search for indications that strongly interacting matter is expected based on symmetry principles.

They engage bright young undergraduates in science through jobs or projects, which develop the research skills they will need for success in graduate school. They reach out to the local community through a variety of activities to awaken the interest of students in the local public school system by visiting local high school science classes, acting as judges in local science fairs and for the State Science Olympiad, and presenting physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair.

Interestingly, evolutionary histories can change across the genome, creating a complex genomic landscape. Understanding genome-wide evolution requires sophisticated computational tools that can analyze the rapidly growing set of genomes sequenced from species spanning the tree of life. Currently available methods for inferring these complex evolutionary histories have serious limitations, either in terms of accuracy or scalability to large datasets. This project will develop new computational methods for reconstructing evolutionary trees for individual segments of the genome while considering their connections to other parts of the genome. The computational methods developed will be made publicly available to the community of evolutionary biologists, and will help improve various downstream biomedical analyses. To facilitate adoption, the PI will train biologists interested in the new methods. Beyond impacting the research community, the PI will contribute to new promising diversity initiatives at UC San Diego to engage URM/Women undergraduate students in research projects defined in the exciting overlap between biology and computing.<br/><br/>A ""gene tree"" shows the evolutionary history for a small segment of the genome, and accurate reconstruction of each gene tree can be difficult because a small segment may provide little data and only a weak signal. A principled approach for improving gene tree estimation is to consider the connection between different parts of the genome. However, computational limitations of such co-estimation approaches have left researchers with only one feasible option: to infer gene trees independently for each segment, ignoring the underlying genome-wide patterns of evolution. This project will develop new scalable statistical methods for inferring gene trees given genomic sequence data and a genome-wide description of the evolutionary history, the so-called species tree. The focus will be on a specific probabilistic model of gene trees, the multi-species coalescent model, that links population level patterns of allele differentiation to species level histories. Scalable gene tree inference under this model remains a poorly studied problem. To develop scalable methods for calculating and optimizing likelihood scores with respect to the multi-species coalescent model, the project will use algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming. Other approaches that will be explored include designing simplified optimization scores that are easier to compute than the full likelihood and developing new approximations to the likelihood function. If successful, the project will produce pioneering scalable solutions for inferring gene trees given the species tree under the multi-species coalescent model, and such a method will have substantial positive impact on downstream biological analyses. Moreover, this project can pave the way for scalable solutions to an even more complex inference problem, where the goal is to co-estimate a large number of gene trees and the species tree in one analysis.

Since discovery of a giant electromechanical response in gadolinium-doped cerium oxides in 2012, this material is considered as a new type of ceramic that generates strain due to a small fraction of their structural units, called electromechanically ""active"". The main challenge towards understanding this mechanism and rational designing new electromechanical materials with the desired response has been the inability to decipher atomic architecture of these units and ""catch them in action"", that is, to take a snapshot of these units while the strain is generated under electric field. In order to fully characterize the structure of active units ""in action"", the investigators are studying thin film doped cerium oxide ceramics under electric field by high energy resolution methods (such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy) and modeling the results by advanced theoretical methods. The project impacts the field of ceramic materials through the development of fundamental understanding and design criteria for this new class of electromechanical materials. The project fosters international ties between Yeshiva University in New York and Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The broader impacts of this project are realized through establishing connections between faculty and students from both institutions, and in engaging underrepresented groups (such as women) in science and engineering disciplines. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Thin films of cerium oxide that have trivalent metal impurities possess intriguing structural, electric and mechanical properties, including ionic conductivity, non-linear elastic effects and strong mechanical stresses in response to the application of electric field. Anatoly Frenkel (Yeshiva University), his international collaborator Igor Lubomirsky (Weizmann Institute of Science) and their respective groups are working to understand the mechanisms of electrostriction (a particularly large electromechanical response that is quadratic with electric field). The investigators strive to answer such fundamental questions as the effects of impurities on the generation of strain and stress in the lattice. They are applying advanced methods of X-ray absorption spectroscopy with high energy resolution in situ, under applied field, to identify the active species - cations that are located in the distorted units - in order to understand, in detail, the behavior of these units and their role in the electrostriction. Data analysis is being carried out by modeling structural distortions theoretically and comparing their simulated X-ray absorption spectra with experimental ones. This project offers research opportunities and training at advanced national research facilities at the post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate levels with significant inclusion of underrepresented female students."

Most animals reproduce sexually even though there is a high evolutionary cost of making males. Males compete with females for resources and decrease the genetic resemblance between a female and her offspring. Few animal species reproduce without mating and most only live for a short evolutionary time. However, an all-female lineage of salamanders (the oldest known all-female vertebrate in North American) has been able to persist for approximately 6 million years. Because the persistence of asexual animals is rare, they can provide valuable clues about the costs and benefits of sexual reproduction. Sometimes these female-only salamanders are able to obtain new genetic material from males of closely related species. Thus, they may gain the benefits of both sexual and asexual reproduction. To test this idea, the researchers will measure the importance of genetic contributions from sexual species into the all-female asexual species over evolutionary time. In addition, the project will include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and outreach activities such as museum displays and social blogs. <br/><br/>This research will quantify the rate and evolutionary history of genome leakage from sexual species in to the unisexual Ambystoma lineage, which will allow us to test the hypothesis that recurrent genome contribution accounts for the greater lineage age of unisexual Ambystoma as compared to other gynogenetic taxa. The researchers will use genome-scale data and evolutionary demographic modeling to evaluate multiple evolutionary scenarios ranging from no genetic contributions from sexual species, to recent (but limited) genome contributions only, or ongoing genome contributions. This will be accomplished by using custom bioinformatics tools to sort genetic variation among the multiple genomes of unisexual salamanders, comparing this variation to that of the genomes of sexual species thought to be the source of novel genetic variation in unisexuals and then using statistical genetic models to estimate the magnitude and timing of genetic exchange between unisexual and sexual salamanders."

The project focuses especially on spaces which are poorly described by classical Euclidean language, such as fractals and sub-Riemannian spaces.  The latter occur as mathematical models for problems in robotics, neurobiology, celestial mechanics and other physical systems.  In each of these models, the underlying geometry is inherently nonsmooth. The proposed research will consequently contribute to developing the mathematical framework which simultaneously underlies a variety of physical applications. On the geometric side, nonsmooth notions of curvature will be studied.  Curvature is a fundamental concept in modern geometry.  For instance, general relativity predicts that curvature is the primary geometric feature of space responsible for gravity.  Nonsmooth generalizations of curvature and their relationship to the structure of measures will also be studied.  Measure theory is a wide-ranging mathematical generalization of fundamental concepts of length, area, and volume.  Finally, analysis refers to the dynamic properties of transformations acting between spaces. Since the classical Newton--Leibniz theory of the derivative is not well-adapted to transformations of nonsmooth spaces, there is currently significant interest in developing a new analytic toolkit to extend the machinery of calculus beyond its usual context.  The principle investigator will continue to train graduate students, postdocs and early-career researchers.  Results of this research program will be disseminated via talks at conferences and workshops, publication of journal articles, and exposition for a general mathematical audience.  The PI is currently coauthoring a graduate textbook on analysis in nonsmooth spaces.  The ongoing preparation of this book will be coordinated with advances in the field, including those obtained as part of this research program.<br/><br/>The project concerns the geometry of measures and submanifolds in, and mappings between, sub-Riemannian manifolds.  Three coordinating themes will be considered.  The first set of problems concerns density of measures and the geometry of submanifolds.  The main goal is a sub-Riemannian analog of a celebrated theorem of David Preiss characterizing rectifiability (a measure-theoretic notion of smoothness) via densities.  This line of investigation will extend to the sub-Riemannian setting some fundamental aspects of Euclidean geometric measure theory tied to notions of curvature for submanifolds.  The primary methodology for this investigation involves the approximation of sub-Riemannian spaces by Riemannian spaces, and an analysis of the limiting behavior of geometric quantities in the Riemannian approximations.  The second theme concerns iteration of conformal and quasiregular mappings.  Such iterative schemes provide a basic combinatorial model for fractal objects. They arise naturally in both hyperbolic geometry and number theory.  Building on his previous work for similarity mappings, the principle investigator will extend the analysis to conformal mappings.  The goal is a detailed description of the geometry of self-conformal limit sets in sub-Riemannian spaces and natural measures on such sets. Finally, the principle investigator will study the type problem for sub-Riemannian quasiregular mappings. The goal here is to understand both the flexibility of quasiregular mappings as well as inherent geometric obstructions to their construction.  The principle investigator will also investigate new constructions of Sobolev mappings inducing optimal measure and dimension distortion, as well as criteria for the density of Lipschitz mappings in spaces of Sobolev mappings with sub-Riemannian targets.  The principle investigator will take advantage of his prior expertise in all of the aforementioned areas, as well as the latest advances in related fields, to pursue answers to the proposed problems.  The proposed research will have a broad impact; it addresses a wide range of questions at the intersection of different mathematical areas. The principle investigator will use this broad framework to identify specific problems suitable for beginning graduate students and postdocs."

Liquid crystalline materials are liquids or soft wax-like substances in which molecules exhibit some degree of ordering and organization; they uniquely combine fluidity of liquids and molecular ordering found in solid crystals. If molecules forming such materials are polar (have a permanent dipole moment), they can undergo realignment in an electric field resulting in switching of optical properties of the material. Such an electro-optical effect is at the heart of modern liquid crystal display industry, which demands improvements in resolution and speed of switching between screen images. This, in turn, motivates the search for new LC materials, such as those investigated in this project. Thus, a team comprised of the principal investigator (PI), co-PI, an international technical expert and undergraduate co-workers design, synthesize and fully characterize new polar liquid crystals derived from boron clusters. Among the main goals of the project is the development of extensive structure-property relationships in this class of materials, preparation of materials for practical applications, and training of undergraduate students for careers in materials chemistry.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This basic research project tests the hypothesis that rationally-designed zwitterionic derivatives of inorganic boron clusters, [closo-1-CB9H10]- and [closo-1-CB12H12]- anions, form liquid crystalline phases and are suitable materials for display applications. In this context, a series of zwitterions is synthesized and investigated for their spectroscopic, structural, thermal and dielectric properties using a broad selection of research tools. The experimental work is augmented with theoretical methods that allow the researchers to formulate a detailed understanding of structure-property relationships and to explain the observed results. The detailed multi-dimensional analysis of specific derivatives is expected to contribute to the understanding of the impact of the molecular structure on properties, materials performance, and to the fundamental chemistry and science of liquid crystals."

Bone pattern elaboration results from increases in bone numbers and connections, and such research is important for understanding processes of both evolution and development. In evolution, increase in the number of bones arranged end-to-end helped transform fins into limbs and aided the colonization of land by extinct vertebrates. In development, normal function and movement depends upon formation of the proper bone numbers and connections, and defective development can lead to severe impairment. Currently, the mechanisms that led to elaboration of the fin skeleton to form limbs are unknown. To identify the genetic factors involved, the researchers will study strains of the model species, zebrafish, that have genetic changes that result in the formation of new fin bones. They will also investigate naturally occurring variation in two species, gar and bowfin, that have different numbers of bones extending from the shoulder. These complementary approaches will reveal the mechanisms regulating growth and formation of the skeleton of fins and limbs, and show how simple genetic changes can lead to the formation of limbs from fins. Understanding the mechanisms of bone pattern elaboration and development has implications for human health and developmental abnormalities, and may provide clues for the evolution of life on land. Additionally, the project will provide research opportunities for Native American undergraduates. <br/><br/>While tetrapod vertebrates have increased the number of bones along the proximo-distal (P-D) axis of the limb, teleost fishes such as the zebrafish have reduced the pectoral fin skeleton; only a single long bone is found along the P-D axis. The researchers performed a forward mutagenesis screen in zebrafish and isolated a novel mutant that forms supernumerary bones along the P-D axis of the fin through a process similar to that seen in the development of tetrapod limbs. The proposed research will extend results from mutant analysis to natural populations to determine if the mutation is producing supernumerary bones by activating ancestral genetic mechanisms. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing will be used to compare gene-expression levels in the developing pectoral fins of wild-type and mutant zebrafish, as well as two species that exhibit natural variation in P-D axis elaboration. This analysis will reveal patterns of differential gene expression that correlate with P-D axis elaboration. Differentially expressed genes will be tested in the zebrafish to determine if their modified expression has an effect on fin morphology. This study will elucidate how additive phenotypic changes arise in development and identify candidate pathways by which additional fin/limb bones are formed in both evolution and disease."

Sodium ion batteries have a significant advantage over widely used Lithium ion batteries, owing to the low cost and abundance of sodium precursor.  Phosphorus-based materials are promising as anodes for sodium ion batteries due to their high capacity and low cost.  However, similar to alloy anodes in lithium ion batteries, phosphorus undergoes ~300% volume change during charge/discharge, leading to pulverization of the active materials, unstable growth of the solid electrolyte interphase, and poor cyclability. With the support of the Solid State nad Materials Chemistry program, this research project strives to bring low-cost, high-performance, long-cycling sodium ion batteries closer to real-world applications by understaning the degradation mechanisms of phosphorus-based anode materials. Such batteries would enable greater integration of intermittent renewable power sources such as wind and solar, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and improve the overall efficiency, stability, and resilience of the power grid.

It is known that populations that are too small can experience high levels of inbreeding and may lose much of their genetic diversity over time. In turn they may face higher extinction probabilities and for this reason population size could be a critical variable in many conservation plans. Population size, however, may be a poor predictor of a population's viability when additional forces are at play. Migration between locations as well as climate induced fluctuations in a population from year to year may be just as important as the average population size in predicting long term trends in a population's likelihood of survival. The researchers will examine the relative effectiveness of average population size, migration between populations and population variability in predicting the viability of populations of two salamander species. The project will develop more informative genetic monitoring techniques as well as the training of a doctoral student.<br/><br/>This project will determine the effective population size (Ne), and gene flow patterns of two salamander species that have been monitored in the same wetland for 37 years. One of the species, Ambystoma opacum, is increasing in number while the other, Ambystoma talpoideum, is decreasing in number over the last fifteen years. This study will answer two questions: First, is the reliability of Ne as a predictor of population viability dependent on metapopulation structure? Second, how do gene flow and annual fluctuations in reproductive rate influence the long-term viability of populations? The question of how gene flow impacts viability estimates based on Ne will be addressed by collecting Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data from individuals from five connected subpopulations using next generation sequencing. Maximum likelihood estimates of Ne for the subpopulations, and Bayesian estimates of gene flow rates between the subpopulations will be calculated for both species. The importance of metapopulation structure in refining conclusions based on Ne will be determined for both declining and growing populations from that data. Individual based census data from previous years will be used to ground truth estimates obtained from genetic samples. Projection models will then be developed to predict whether the metapopulation of each species is at risk for extinction or if only individual subpopulations are expected be lost and recolonized over time."

The search for a mathematical apparatus capable of handling these dual aspects in a unified manner motivated the foundation of noncommutative geometry. In this young field of mathematics, the classical concept of a space formed of points labeled by numerical coordinates is replaced by a qualitatively more general paradigm, in which the algebra of coordinates consists of bounded operators (observables) that do not necessarily commute under the natural multiplication. The geometry of a noncommutative space is encoded in an unbounded operator, whose inverse plays the role of the line element in classical geometry, which interacts with the observables in a bounded fashion. With innate spatial intuition rendered inoperative by the forfeit of commutativity, even the most basic geometric notions, such as locality, symmetry, and curvature, have to undergo a drastic conceptual metamorphosis. Helpful hints come from physics, where the first two appear in quantum field theory as the high-energy limit and gauge symmetry, respectively, while the last is the very manifestation of gravity in Einstein's general relativity. This project aims to deepen the conceptual understanding of the above triad of notions in the noncommutative framework, as well as to develop effective mathematical tools for their quantitative measurement. Besides relevance for physics, the envisaged developments hold a proven potential of having applications in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>The first part of the project, building on recent work of the principal investigator and collaborators, will apply the enhanced pseudodifferential calculus for C*-dynamical systems to a host of problems involving curvature calculations for concrete noncommutative spaces, such as the noncommutative tori of arbitrary dimension. The second subproject will refine the higher index pairing between elliptic operators and Alexander-Spanier cocycles on a closed manifold and extend it to a pairing defined over the algebra of bounded pseudo-differential operators. In particular, this will yield an upgraded version of the Helton-Howe integral formula for the trace of the totally antisymmetric commutator of an n-tuple of Toeplitz operators, promoting it to a full-fledged index theorem. It will also extend Perrot's formula for the periodic cyclic cohomology class of the Radul cocycle, as well as the vanishing of the periodic cyclic cohomology class of the Wodzicki residue. The third project concerns a new Hopf algebra K(n) that presents the advantage of acting directly on the noncommutative space of leaves of any foliation rather than on its frame bundle. Its Hopf cyclic cohomology captures all transverse Chern classes, but misses the secondary classes. The goal is to construct an enhanced, topological version of the Hopf algebra K(n), whose Hopf cyclic cohomology will serve as a universal receptacle for all the geometric characteristic classes of foliations. In addition, this part of the project seeks to express these classes in terms of explicit Hopf cyclic cocycles and employ the concrete representations to derive geometric and topological consequences."

For example, the question of whether there are infinitely many 7's in the decimal expansion of pi asks about a property of the geometric constant pi as expressed in our base-10 representation of it. This research project in the foundations of mathematics investigates the effective, and more generally definable, aspects of Diophantine approximation, the meta-mathematical status of familiar theorems in countable combinatorics, and the pure structure theory of relative definability. <br/><br/>One can view classical theorems in Diophantine approximation, such as Borel's almost-every real number is absolutely normal or Roth's every irrational algebraic number has irrationality exponent 2, as asserting properties of real numbers in terms of our descriptions of them. Borel's theorem asserts a property of expansions by integer bases, and Roth's theorem asserts a property of approximation by rational numbers. There is a natural affinity between this tradition in number theory and the study of definability in recursion theory. This research project will investigate the connections between these areas. For example, what is the exact relationship between the irrationality exponent of a real number, or more generally its Mahler transcendence measures, and the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of its binary expansion? Second, a real number is absolutely normal if for every integer base b, each digit appears with asymptotic frequency 1/b. What other patterns of asymptotic frequencies are possible? This last question also touches dynamical systems in the form of Furstenberg's x2 x3 conjecture."

Infrared (IR) optical technology is widely used in optical communications as well as in military and defense applications that require high-resolution imaging under conditions of pure darkness.  Currently, synthetic polymers cannot be used as transmitting materials for mid-IR imaging applications as lenses or other device components since these materials strongly absorb IR radiation in the spectral window (3-5 micrometers) required for thermal imaging.

Conventional superconductors, discovered over 100 years ago, are composed of simple metals, and the phenomenon was completely explained about 50 years ago. The applications of superconductors include the ability to transmit many times more power than metals at the same temperature and cross-sectional area. However, conventional superconductors are limited in that they have to be cooled to very low temperatures. More importantly, they are limited in the magnitude of current they can transmit (critical current) in an external magnetic field (critical field). Over the years, conventional superconductors have been improved and new areas have been discovered that enhanced these current carrying capabilities in a magnetic field, making possible high-field research magnets and applications that include MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Enter the discoveries of unconventional superconductors about 40 years ago, followed by the discovery of high-temperature superconductors 30 years ago, these materials which are not good metals above their critical temperature, are not completely understood, but many of these intriguing materials can transmit much more current in extremely high magnetic fields than conventional superconductors. Not only can the applications of unconventional superconductors be transformative, but the fundamental physics explaining their normal and superconducting properties remains elusive over all of this time. With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the research group will study unconventional superconductor phases that include metals such as niobium and tantalum, as well as the nonmetallic elements sulfur, selenium or tellurium. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Transition metal chalcogenides comprise superconducting phases with high critical temperatures, such as iron and molybdenum chalcogenides. The research effort focuses on new ternary and quaternary niobium and tantalum chalcogenides, with some of these phases showing unconventional superconductivity with very large critical fields. At the core of this behavior are interactions between electron charge, electron spin and the lattice (the crystal structure). Critically important are the synthesis and growth of high quality samples for a detailed understanding of structure-property relationships. Structural characterization using diffraction techniques will be combined with investigations of physical properties, including magnetic susceptibility, electronic transport properties and optical properties. Furthermore, tuning of the physical properties by a combination of chemical substitutions and stoichiometry variations are explored. Crystal growth of such phases is well matched to the areas delineated in the National Academy of Sciences report ""Frontiers in Crystalline Matter: From Discovery to Technology,"" which focuses on the opportunities for discovery and growth of crystalline matter in the US. This research is a highly interdisciplinary activity that requires a variety of skills. Training of students in the art and science of crystal growth and characterization of materials at undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels trains the next generation of scientists and engineers active in this field and builds the highly skilled workforce needed to address tomorrow's challenges."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar at the University of California-Davis exploring the STEM engagement of minority and women college students. Currently, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related fields. This underrepresentation is a problem because it can serve as a hindrance to advancements in all areas of STEM.  Previous research has started to identify factors both pre- and post-college that may encourage people from underrepresented groups to continue in STEM-related fields. However, we know little about students' day-to-day experiences as they go through the early college years, when many students exit STEM majors. There is reason to expect that diversity in the STEM workforce can lead to innovative solutions to very complex problems.  Thus, findings from this project will impact not only emerging scholars in STEM fields, but also future academics, researchers, and STEM employees. This project will broaden the participation of scientists from currently under-represented groups: 1) the project aims directly address the underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in the US STEM workforce and identifies solutions to improve this; and 2) during the 2-year fellowship, the principal investigator will engage in mentoring activities to encourage other women and ethnic minorities to become or stay involved in the sciences. As part of the project, study findings will be broadly disseminated to inform and transform existing interventions implemented by various entities within the university community (i.e., dorm administration, student service groups, university administration).<br/><br/>In the United States, women and ethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas of study This is despite the fact that women make up slightly more than half of the US population and ethnic minority groups are increasing their representation in the US, including in undergraduate institutions. The proposed study will offer critical insights to share with the university community on ways to increase the numbers of underrepresented groups in STEM, as well as ways to retain them.  In the proposed study, 300 college freshmen majoring in a STEM field will be recruited (projected ethnic breakdown based on oversampling are 25% Caucasian, 20% Black/African American, 25% Hispanic/Latino, and 30% Asian descent; 60% women) from a larger study of 1800 college freshmen in order to: 1) explore the daily associations between stereotype threat (feelings of being treated a certain way due to race or ethnicity) experiences and STEM satisfaction, and whether this association strengthens over time; 2) evaluate self-efficacy for STEM field success as a mediator of the association between daily stereotype threats and daily STEM satisfaction; and 3) examine the potential protective role of diversity exposure on continuation in STEM-related fields.  To address these aims, the study will use a structural equation model within in a longitudinal framework (four time points across 2 years) with 5-day daily report periods embedded within 3 of those time points."

Some nuclei are spherical, while others have non-spherical shapes (similar to an onion, a zucchini, or a pear); the shape of the nucleus is unique for each isotope of each element.  Because we cannot take an ordinary photograph of the nucleus to investigate its shape and structure, other methods must be employed.  Through reactions at the University of Kentucky particle accelerator, neutrons are produced and then scattered from the nucleus.  In the process, the nucleus gains and subsequently releases energy that can be detected.  This information is used to deduce the shape of the nucleus and to gain an understanding of how the neutrons and protons in the nucleus contribute to its properties.

Detailed investigations of stable nuclei complement advances in nuclear structure achieved by studying nuclei at extreme conditions of temperature and angular momentum or in regions far from stability.  Experimental innovations in the laboratory, e.g., the development of capabilities for measuring lifetimes in heavy nuclei, have played a key role in this research.  These advances, coupled with the unique capabilities of this laboratory for the production of high-quality, time-bunched monoenergetic neutrons, probe important questions and make meaningful contributions to our knowledge of nuclear structure."

The underlying theme of the work is the strategic use of inexpensive and readily available molecular building blocks to arrive at the complex architectures of the targeted natural products in as few chemical operations as possible. In so doing, existing synthetic methods are pushed to their limits by their use in very challenging contexts, and novel chemical reactivity is uncovered and utilized. The results of these studies positively impact any area of applied science that benefits from chemical synthesis, including pharmaceutical development, materials science, and more. This grant also supports outreach activities to middle school students from underserved communities to engage in scientific experiments on-campus, and simultaneously learn about the college experience.<br/>		<br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of several strategies for the rapid buildup of the molecular architectures of four different types of complex natural products. The Himbert intramolecular arene/allene cycloaddition reaction and the resulting strain-driven rearrangement of the cycloadducts, transformations that have both previously been carefully investigated in these laboratories, are being leveraged in a concise synthesis of a small family of alkaloids. A combination of an arene-terminated cation-pi cyclization, a bioinspired A-ring cleavage, and a cycloaddition of a novel cumulene equivalent Diels-Alder dienophile set the stage for a rapid synthesis of a complex diterpenoid. An underutilized heterocycle annulation is leveraged to synthesize a structurally unique antibiotic alkaloid. Finally, either a concise and unusual but potentially biogenetically relevant route or a more conventional approach facilitate the first synthesis in an unusual family of complex alkaloids. The broader impacts of this work include the exceptional research training for undergraduate and graduate students.

For example, the mathematical modeling of any phenomenon that undergoes change over time (such as the population of bacteria in a body, the stock market, etc.) can be viewed as a dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This project will enhance the tools available in these branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which other reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind. <br/><br/>This research project will use techniques from non-Archimedean analysis and geometry in order to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and geometry. The project makes use of Berkovich spaces, non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One part of the project involves Calabi-Yau manifolds, geometric objects that play an important role in mathematical physics. The principal investigator and collaborator will use non-Archimedean techniques to study a conjecture concerning one-parameter families of complex Calabi-Yau manifolds that degenerate to a real Calabi-Yau manifold. Another part of the project is in arithmetic dynamics. Given a discrete-time two-dimensional dynamical system defined by a pair of polynomials with rational coefficients, the research investigates how the arithmetic complexity grows along orbits of the dynamics. Here the problem is formulated in terms of elementary number theory but approached using a detailed study of an induced dynamical system on a Berkovich space."

A central topic in the research of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations is the smoothness of solutions under various regularity assumptions on coefficients and domains. Many equations and systems from physics and engineering involve discontinuous coefficients or domains with sharp corners or cusps, or even fractal structures. For instance, fiber-reinforced materials may have fiber inclusions that are very closely spaced and may even touch. In such cases, much of the classical theory of partial differential equations is no longer applicable. Another research topic of major importance is hydrodynamic turbulence in fluid and gas dynamics. The study of turbulence leads to new ideas in scientific computing, differential equations, and statistics, and it has been characterized as one of the most fascinating problems in fluid mechanics.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will carry out research closely related to the aforementioned topics and will attempt to address some of the open problems in these areas. He will focus his attention on several projects that can be gathered into three main topical areas. First, the project will develop new methods to study certain elliptic equations associated with composite materials (e.g., elasticity problems, conductivity problems). The principal investigator is particularly interested in the fine regularity of solutions to these equations, including higher-order regularity and more quantitative derivative estimates. Second, the project will explore nonstandard Sobolev estimates for local (or nonlocal) nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations with irregular coefficients or kernels, in possibly irregular domains. Finally, the project will investigate well-posedness and regularity issues for certain deterministic and stochastic fluid equations such as the magnetohydrodynamics equations."

At the transition point, the properties of the system such as the volume or heat capacity may change discontinuously. The aim of our research is to study phase transitions in mathematical models using probabilistic tools in the following three directions. (1) The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a permutation is the length of a maximal subsequence of the permutation in which the elements increase. How long is the LIS for a uniformly random permutation? This question has been studied in connection with practical applications such as sorting sequences, disk drive scheduling and airplane boarding times. The mathematical study of the LIS has revealed deep and unexpected connections of the problem with areas such as the theory of random matrices, analytic combinatorics and random polymer models.  The proposed research aims to study the LIS when the permutation is drawn from certain non-uniform distributions and associated phase transitions. (2) Many computational problems can be phrased as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) where one wants to find a solution to a number of variables with a set of constraints imposed on them. CSPs were first studied in computer science motivated by applications to artificial intelligence. To study the difficulty of finding solutions in typical rather than worst case scenarios, researchers study random CSPs. Using sophisticated heuristics, physicists have made detailed predictions about the location and nature of phase transitions in random CSPs. The accuracy of these heuristic predictions motivates the importance of discovering the rigorous mathematical foundations of these techniques. (3) Interacting particle processes are used to model large, randomly evolving interacting systems of agents that arise in the natural sciences including in physics and in biology. The exclusion and interchange random walks are examples of such interacting particle processes. In the symmetric case the long term mixing behavior of the random walk and the nature of phase transitions is well studied. The goal of this research is to understand the mixing properties of natural asymmetric and weighted versions of these processes. While achieving these three goals, the principal investigator will create exciting research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in probability, mentoring programs with the goal of retention of women in mathematics, and the development of online curricular material.<br/><br/>The main aim of this project is to develop new theory and analysis for phase transitions in certain discrete probabilistic models. The first problem is to study the limiting distribution of the LIS in non-uniformly random permutations by way of analyzing the fluctuations of the LIS as the parameter of the distribution is varied. The distribution is known to be Gaussian in one regime of the parameter and Tracy-Widom in another and we aim to study this transition. The second problem is to study the condensation and clustering transitions in random CSPs such as the hardcore model on random graphs. The research aims to identify the location of the reconstruction threshold more precisely in these models and to explore the connection to the clustering transition. Finally, the proposal will consider Markov processes such as asymmetric exclusion and interchange and attempt to relate the mixing times and spectral gaps of these processes to the corresponding quantities for a single particle and to understand the cutoff phenomenon for these processes."

Incorporation of PBL in CS/IT is also designed to increase participation, retention, and success of women. The program will leverage student talent to address current community problems and expose students to the need for CS/IT in fields outside the traditional industries by incorporating community-based learning techniques in the capstone course. The project will be disseminated through the project website, ATE Central, and an annual Curriculum Showcase. Curriculum development projects will be widely available for use and adaption by other CS/IT training programs.<br/><br/>The project will expand the critical thinking skills of CS/IT graduates and impact more than 200 students per year taking foundational and higher level courses leading to 11 college credit certificates and 4 associate degrees in Networking, Programming, Information Technology and Internet Services. Specifically, 1) the foundational introductory classes will be revised to teach key technical and critical thinking processes through problems drawn directly from industry, 2) critical thinking and problem-solving learning outcomes will be mapped and integrated in higher level courses, and 3) the capstone course will be revised to require students to work with community and industry leaders to identify and develop novel solutions for current, real-life challenges. Local business members will participate as members of the curriculum design team, provide problems, and review the new curriculum. The entire CS/IT faculty, including adjunct faculty, will be involved in the program design and implementation to benefit from the technical expertise of all CS/IT fields and ensure that new pedagogies are implemented across the curriculum. They will participate in curriculum redesign efforts and in professional development activities to share pedagogical changes and incorporate PBL consistently and effectively. Tutors from academic support centers at the college will be included in professional development trainings to ensure they are prepared to assist students with the new problem-based curriculum. Students will develop technical skills, cultivate critical reasoning and creative abilities, and be prepared to innovate, adapt and thrive in the competitive and evolving CS/IT industry. The program will draw from successful PBL programs in engineering and computer education to integrate additional critical thinking and hands-on learning with the strong technical aspects of the current CS/IT curriculum. This will ensure that skills that students need to gain in the courses will meet the new and evolving needs of industry. New PBL pedagogies will be built-in through a step-wise process beginning with the foundational courses. The effectiveness of these changes will be evaluated and improvement made prior to incorporation into the next level of courses.

This award will help scientists to observe as many gravitational waves as possible while learning as much as possible about the waves' astronomical sources. Specifically, this award supports a research program that uses supercomputers to predict the gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars and to study the most important source of noise limiting LIGO's reach. Through their participation in this program, students at California State University Fullerton, a primarily undergraduate-serving and Hispanic-serving institution, will learn transferable skills in research and computing while playing important roles in the inauguration of a new era in astronomy. The imminent gravitational-wave discoveries could dramatically change our understanding of the universe.<br/><br/>This award renews support for California State University Fullerton's computational gravitational-wave research program. The PI and undergraduate and master's-level researchers will address two crucial challenges in computational gravitational-wave physics using high performance computing. First, they will use the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to model merging black holes and neutron stars--the most promising sources for Advanced LIGO--focusing on the challenging but astrophysically important case of rapid black-hole spins. The resulting simulated gravitational waveforms will help maximize LIGO's reach, in part by leading to better approximate waveform models for future LIGO searches; the simulations will also reveal how warped spacetime behaves under extreme conditions never before modeled.  Second, the PI and student researchers will use high-performance computing to model thermal noise--one of the most significant fundamental limits to detectors' astrophysical sensitivities--focusing on a highly promising avenue for improvement, crystalline mirror materials. Leveraging these highly sophisticated techniques will allow for breakthroughs in the understanding of the fluctuations in complex elastic structures, including mirrors with crystalline coatings. These new insights will allow for substantial improvements in the thermal noise of high precision measurements, currently a limiting noise source for gravitational-wave detection, atomic clocks, and inertial sensing."

To address this need, this project at Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC) in Virginia is designed to develop an innovative model to augment technician education with competencies that blend essential technical and non-technical skills and expand awareness of 21st century manufacturing. The model is in alignment with an advanced manufacturing competency model available through the U.S. Department of Labor that documents the skills and competencies required for workplace success in advanced manufacturing industries. The blended model for technician education will be utilized in the new Associate of Applied Science degree program in Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Technology (AIMT) at the college that was developed with industry partners to address an industry defined need for multi-skilled technicians in advanced manufacturing as well as in other technician education programs at the college and will result in students entering the workforce with 21st century skills. Expanding awareness of 21st century manufacturing will ensure that new talent is attracted to manufacturing to address the critical need for multi-skilled technicians.  <br/><br/>Through collaboration with regional manufacturers and community partners, the goal of the project will be achieved through: 1) development of courses and modules that integrate non-technical competencies with technical content and 2) expansion of awareness of technical advancements and career opportunities in manufacturing through outreach activities to groups of potential students who may not have considered manufacturing as a career including high schools and veterans groups. With support of a planning grant provided in 2013 by the Virginia General Assembly, and several other regional studies conducted between 2011 and 2013, the college documented employer hiring needs for advanced manufacturing within the region. The AIMT program contains essential elements modeled after the ATE and NASA SpaceTEC program (DUE 1303935) that organizes students into cohorts that enter and progress through the program together and integrates academic instruction with rotating co-op/internship at multiple job sites under the supervision of subject matter experts (SMEs). An extensive evaluation is planned to determine the impact on worker performance of incorporating instruction on specific non-technical workplace competencies such as team building and diversity into the technician education program. The knowledge and application of non-technical competencies of students will be evaluated by comparing the non-technical competency and job performance of students in a cohort that did not receive the non-technical instruction with those of students in cohorts that receive that instruction. Activities can be replicated and integrated into advanced manufacturing degree programs and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technician education programs offered at community colleges throughout the country. Materials highlighting the technical advancements of 21st century manufacturing and career opportunities will be developed and shared widely with secondary and post-secondary institutions and other stakeholders through the college website and social media outlets. The new model of technician education and promotional materials will be showcased through ATE Central, TeachingTechnicians.org, presentations at professional meetings, and web based communications."

Red team-blue team scenarios have been used to qualitatively assess and improve security in military and intelligence organizations. The defending (blue) team seeks to operate the network efficiently and securely while the attacking (red) team seeks to disrupt network operation. The research will yield methodology for quantitative red team-blue team scenario analysis based on mathematical models, along with illustrative scenarios arising from problems in power network stability and distributed multi-robot systems. A foundational understanding of resilience and comprehensive mitigation strategies will help to prevent severe attack consequences and protect public health and safety in all application drivers for cyber-physical systems. <br/><br/>Despite significant recent research interest, a complete understanding of resilience in cyberphysical networks remains limited. This project will explore a specific game theoretic framework of two-team stochastic dynamic games that mathematically captures crucial issues in red team-blue team scenarios. Specifically, the research will determine how teams of devices in a cyber-physical network can cooperate to make optimal use of information given that (1) each device has only partial information about the state of the network and actions of other devices; (2) the network dynamics and signal flows are subject to random disturbances; and (3) the networks dynamics and signal flows are subject to actions of adversarial teams, whose agents themselves have only partial information about the network. The results will also include algorithms for designing information structures  who knows what and when  to improve network resiliency using combinatorial optimization and convex relaxation techniques.

Riemannian manifolds are higher-dimensional generalizations of the familiar concept of a surface in three-dimensional space, such as the surface of a ball or a donut. Four-dimensional manifolds (with three spatial and one temporal direction) are used in general relativity as models for the universe. Manifolds of other dimensions are used by theoretical physicists in string theory, which may lead to a unification of quantum field theory and gravity. The conferences will bring together distinguished senior speakers and a wide range of junior mathematicians to disseminate recent research progress and catalyze future research in the subject.  The opportunities presented by the meetings to discuss research with leaders in the field will help to train and encourage the next generation of researchers. The conference series makes special efforts to encourage women and minority mathematicians to participate in the meetings. <br/><br/>The field of geometric flows is of great current interest due its many applications to the understanding of Riemannian manifolds. Within Ricci flow for a Riemannian metric, there has been progress in understanding the structure of solutions, their singularities, their asymptotics, and uniqueness. Flows starting from more general initial data (for example, a metric space, or a manifold with unbounded curvature, or an incomplete metric) are becoming better understood. A better understanding of Ricci flow may lead to advances in areas such as general relativity, string theory, the geometry of closed four-dimensional smooth manifolds, and renormalization in quantum field theory. The study of mean curvature flow may lead to advances in knot theory, image processing, materials science, and minimal surfaces. The conference series brings together experts at the frontier of research in these various topics from around the United States. The conference is expected to generate transfers of knowledge, new collaborations, and a cross-fertilization of ideas, and further inspire graduate students and junior mathematicians.

Attacks against vulnerable software lead to compromise and loss of financial and personal information. While the application stores and the software manufacturers may strive to provide vulnerability-free software, the onus to defend against attacks and ensure integrity of one?s personal information and resources is on the end-user. However, due to the lack of source code, (1) end users are unable to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the software they run, and (2) the open source community is unable to detect violation of software licensing terms by closed source software. This project aims to recover design information from binaries in a platform-neutral and obfuscation resilient manner. As a direct consequence, this project promises advancement in end-user-level security, and for the first time, facilitates detection of design-level plagiarism in software. <br/><br/>This project aims to reconstruct a design profile of a C++ binary by leveraging the unavoidable information leakage that occurs due to adherence to Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. It takes advantage of the platform-independent nature of ABI specification to offer both platform neutrality and obfuscation resilience in design recovery. First, traditional static and dynamic binary analysis approaches are employed in order to extract design elements and design pertinent features. Then, theorem proving is utilized to establish relationship between various design-level program entities. This project views adherence to ABI as a source of design leakage, exploits the leakage to recover design information, and investigates ways to minimize the leakage while maintaining interoperability through adherence.<br/><br/>The results from this research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and software release. Based on the research, new course materials and professional training tutorials will be developed, to help future security engineers and researchers gain in-depth knowledge about design recovery."

The main aims of the project are to study the expansion properties of Cayley graphs and to understand representation theoretic properties of pro-finite and discrete groups. The project involves studying objects central to geometric group theory, including automorphism groups of free groups and mapping class groups.

In the past decade, the use of visual evidence and arguments in courtrooms has exploded, but empirical research on the effects of these tools on legal decision-making has just begun. Lawyers, judges, and juries are faced with a barrage of images, often gruesome in nature. When determining whether to exclude gruesome photographs, judges must decide whether the prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. This project addresses the legally relevant question of how and why gruesome photographs increase guilt and punishment judgments to better inform judges' admissibility decisions. More specifically, this project examines how emotionally evocative images can pose a danger of unfair prejudice by making jurors more conviction-prone--even when the images do not provide additional probative information. This is achieved by exploring the effect of gruesome photographs on mock jurors' physiological and emotional response to the evidence, attention to other case evidence, and the jury deliberation process. The research will also test the effectiveness of several realistic and relatively simple legal safeguards that might mitigate the prejudicial effects of gruesome photographs without sacrificing their probative information (i.e., substituting black-and-white photographs, jury instructions, deliberation). The implications will extend beyond courtrooms to inform recent broader societal questions about whether the public should be exposed to graphic images of harm to inform policy debates, such as images of school shootings, police shootings, or torture of U.S. military detainees.<br/><br/>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team to conduct three experiments testing whether viewing gruesome photographs increases negative emotion, which in turn biases jurors' attention to other case evidence in a pro-prosecution direction, which ultimately increases their confidence in a guilty verdict and greater punitiveness. Jury-eligible adults will view evidence from a murder trial that includes either no gruesome photographs, B&W gruesome photographs, or color gruesome photographs of the murder victim and then will make legal judgments about the case. Participants' physiological emotional responses will be monitored throughout the process. This project represents the first investigation of gruesome images on legal decision making that incorporates jury-level outcomes, physiological monitoring, visual attention to other evidence, and the dynamics of the group deliberation process. Identifying specific psychological mechanisms by which photographs influence judgments (emotional responses, attention to other evidence, deliberation processes) will inform legal doctrine by clarifying the circumstances under which these photographs are likely to result in unfair prejudice."

Such detections will allow new tests of our current theory of gravity when applied to the most extreme systems imaginable. Likely sources of these waves include binary systems of black holes and neutron stars and solar mass objects orbiting and eventually spiraling into very large black holes - one thousand to ten billion times the mass of the Sun. These sources include some of the most surprising objects in the universe. New analysis is being developed to more efficiently describe the spacetime dynamics of systems of compact objects, such as rotating black hole binaries, which evolve through the emission of gravitational waves. The experimental effort leading toward the detection of gravitational waves and, ultimately, the analysis of the source characteristics will directly benefit from accurate theoretical prediction of the orbital trajectories.<br/><br/>To pursue this work, the exploration of gravitational self force effects will continue.

This work is carried out in collaboration with colleagues at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and with a postdoc at UF. Confidence in the regularization required for both self force and post-Newtonian calculations will be increased, as will understanding of the post-Newtonian expansion itself. New gauge invariant quantities, with second and higher order derivatives acting on the metric, will be systematically investigated for perturbations of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, and equations which they satisfy will be sought. This latter effort will be carried out in collaboration with a colleague in Southampton University, and with several mathematical colleagues with ties to the Albert Einstein Institute in Golm, Germany. The similarities and differences between problems in the Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries will be carefully analyzed with a view to making self force calculations in the Kerr spacetime background more efficient."

This question, one of the Clay Millennial Problems, is as mysterious as its solution would be important. In other parts of harmonic analysis, similar questions arise. One of the most famous problems along these lines is the Kakeya problem: Can a set in some Euclidean space contain a unit line segment in every direction but be of lower dimension than the ambient space? This question is connected to important questions in several areas of mathematics, and an example of such a set could provide insight into singularities of solutions to wave equations and Schrodinger equations. The Kakeya problem also shares many features with other problems in the field of additive combinatorics, the field whose central question is whether a set of numbers giving rise to many additive equations is always an indication of some additive structure in the set or can occur as a sort of malevolent coincidence. This project aims to classify and explain the kind of coincidences that can occur in all these problems.<br/><br/>This project takes aim at three specific problems. First, the principal investigator will study whether the quasi-geostrophic equation in the plane develops singularities. He hopes to do this by studying simplified model problems in which all of the action takes place in a finite-dimensional Lie group, one of the jet groups of the class of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. Second, he would like to show that a Kakeya set in three dimensions has a Hausdorff dimension that is strictly greater than two and a half. He hopes to do this by exploiting as few structural properties of the set as possible. Earlier work used structural properties heavily to obtain good Minkowski-dimension bounds; it is anticipated that a lighter approach will be effective for the problem of Hausdorff dimension. Finally, the principal investigator seeks to develop a good theory for finding structured parts of additively nonsmoothing sets. He will attempt to extend earlier work on the size of capsets with implications for the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture."

He was emphasizing in this pithy remark the characteristic feature of crystals, their striking polyhedral shapes with sharp edges and flat faces; crystals, by definition, are straight. Witness facetted gemstones, or naturally grown quartz. However, it was recognized almost a century ago that a wide variety of crystals can be made to grow with twisted, helix-like morphologies -- forms that are decidedly not straight. Remarkably, this general feature of the crystal kingdom was largely forgotten, even though it is characteristic of common substances such as aspirin. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the research team aims to understand how crystals twist themselves as they grow. These processes are windows into the mechanical properties of crystals built from molecules, processes that underlie important industrial operations such as the tableting of pharmaceuticals. Twisted crystals are vivid in their rhythmic bands of optical contrast, promising a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic handed forms. The research team is partnered with several Bronx public high schools in order to provide science identity-building research experiences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The origin of growth induced deformations of form presumably lie in the supramolecular chemistry of mixed crystals and in the manner in which these forces are manifest in the mechanical properties of solid bodies.  The team has shown that additives induce twisting stereospecifically at growing crystal interfaces. Additives likely twist crystals by creating mixed domains with distinct metric properies. Mismatches at the molecular level produce strain that in turn can generate stress and twist moments. The strategy is threefold: 1. Establishing the conditions for twisting mixed or disordered crystals of substituted benzenes about which we already understand the origin of growth induced strain from long-standing studies of single crystals. 2. Using advanced microscopies to accurately describe the shapes of crystals with growth induced curvature -- this work is proceeding in collaboration with Professor E. Efrati at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the collaborative arrangement established by the Division of Materials Research and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation. 3. Weizmann experts in differential geometry of twisted ribbons are analyzing growth deformation within the framework of geometric frustration encoded in local differential growth. These studies will be matched with atomistic force-field and molecular dynamics simulations."

Some useful metal chalcogenide systems can form several closely related crystal structures, and even small differences in how the atoms are arranged can dramatically influence their properties. Therefore, in order to control and tune the properties of metal chalcogenides, it is important to understand how to control their crystal structures.

The molecules arrange themselves to be more ordered than in an ordinary liquid but less so than in a crystalline solid.  Nematic liquid crystal are an important example of this.  The molecules in nematics all orient along a common direction.  Impurities, like small particles, can disrupt this order and introduce important new effects.  These can include important new optical and magnetic properties that potentially enable new technologies.  The behavior becomes even richer when the order in the fluid is spatially patterned or changes with time.  This project will investigate experimentally several classes of spatially or temporally varying nematic liquid crystals. They include 'active' nematics that undergo internally driven perpetual flow and that are seeded with magnetic particles and nematics with a striped pattern of ordering that should cause particles to sort themselves spontaneously by size.  Among the broader impacts of the project will be research training and education for graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also enable a partnership with a local majority-minority magnet science high school to provide talented Baltimore City students with opportunities for research internships.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The study of inclusions suspended in liquid crystals can lead to important new insight about the viscoelastic and interfacial properties of these materials and can further create novel platforms for manipulation of colloids through unique anisotropic interactions engendered by the fluids. Further, particle-dispersed liquid crystals hold technological promise as composite materials with enhanced properties deriving from coupling of the particles to the liquid crystalline order. This work will seek to advance substantially the understanding of the nature of dynamics in liquid crystalline materials and how the dynamics relates to colloidal transport. The particular goal will be to interrogate fluids with nematic order that are driven from equilibrium, either by internally generated flows in the case of active nematics or by externally imposed electric or stress fields, and to investigate how the spatiotemporal response to this driving couples to the particle motion. The research will focus on three thematically linked projects: (i) active nematic films containing magnetically actuated nano- and micro-particles that will provide new insights into the viscoelastic and hydrodynamic properties of active matter on key intrinsic lengthscales and timescales; (ii) colloidal dynamics in patterned and dynamically modulated liquid crystals configured to test striking predictions for colloidal transport in such environments; and (iii) nanoparticle dynamics in fluids with shear-induced nematic order, where new x-ray scattering techniques can enable novel microscopic perspectives on the structural dynamics of such out-of-equilibrium, driven systems. Broader impacts of the work will include research training for graduate and undergraduate students in physics that will prepare them for careers in academia and industry.

Internships and coop experiences have long been one solution to bridging this gap; however, rural colleges with widely dispersed and economically disadvantaged student bodies with low educational attainment rates have found that many students are unable to participate in traditional internship programs. To address the shortage of internship opportunities, Klamath Community College (KCC) in rural south central Oregon is enhancing the job readiness of students in the Computer Engineering Technology and Digital Media and Design associate degree programs through virtual and peer-to-peer internships in addition to traditional, one-on-one internships. Faculty members will collaborate with businesses and industry to create and evaluate three different models to provide options for students to participate in work-based educational experiences. As a result, graduates will be better-prepared and ready to enter the technician workforce. The program encompasses a potential to benefit society by providing a model for other rural colleges with similar economic and labor market conditions. Nationwide, of the 860 publically controlled community college districts, 553 (64%) are rural community colleges with a total annual student enrollment of 3.4 million. Students and businesses served by these colleges will benefit from a flexible approach to internship development. The advanced technological education programs at the college will gain exposure through active relationships with businesses in the community. Increased awareness about college programs and the availability of a highly-qualified applicant pool will attract new businesses and spur economic development. <br/><br/>The project approach will provide flexibility to students and businesses. Virtual internships will connect students in remote locations, where many courses are delivered via synchronous classrooms, with local businesses and industry employers. The long-standing lack of access to opportunities due to geographic distances will be resolved. Use of the Internet is the primary means of communications, which saves students from traveling long distances of up to 180 miles round trip per day. Peer-to-peer internships provide a creative, cost-saving solution for smaller businesses that can offer valuable work-site experience but are unable to dedicate staff time to constantly train new interns. Businesses will utilize graduates from the college who have worked as interns prior to becoming an employee to subsequently train the next student interns. Participation in traditional, one-on-one internships will be available to students living in close proximity to the college and the worksite. Through this program, the number of employers directly undertaking the training and supervision of the interns in an actual work-site environment will be increased. All three internship models will bridge classroom education and application of technical skills through on-the-job training. Students will build their resume by listing recent work history and job references in occupational fields related to their academic degrees. Businesses will be able to vet potential job applicants. A positive experience will lead to paid employment with participating businesses and improve student employability. College faculty will be exposed to the workforce needs and technology requirements of local businesses. Curriculum development will be shaped to ensure that the college is teaching the most relevant job skills and that students are well-prepared to obtain employment. A comprehensive summative evaluation is planned to determine the success (and factors of success) of each of the internship models for students, the college, and employers as well as a formative evaluation to make recommendations for modifications as the project progresses."

The project builds on an existing collaboration and strong preliminary results that predict high piezo response from conformational changes of polar molecules in an applied electric field. The project advances the synthesis, modeling, and characterization of new electroresponsive bio-inspired materials. At each stage, the research identifies responsive molecular targets as well as the properties needed to produce optimal layers and films.

Specifically, the research aims to provide insights into the relative contributions of the West African Monsoon (WAM), extratropical cyclones, Mediterranean cold air surges, and tropical plumes to African Humid Period (AHP) rainfall (~14,800 - 5,000 years Before Present. <br/><br/>At millennial timescales, northern Africa experienced dramatic climate and environmental change. During the early to mid-Holocene AHP, the world's largest present-day hot desert, the Sahara, received abundant rainfall and supported widespread lakes, wetlands, and vegetation.  Given the critical role of the present-day Sahara in Earth's radiation budget and its influence on Sahel rainfall, global mineral dust concentrations, biogeochemical cycles, and tropical cyclogenesis, climate variability in the Sahara, such as that observed during the Holocene, has profound impacts on the global climate system.  By evaluating the contribution of these processes to AHP rainfall, the research will assist in interpreting the sources of moisture recorded in proxy records from the Sahara-Arabian desert belt which are currently ambiguous because they lie near the border of the tropical monsoon and mid-latitude rainfall regimes. <br/><br/>An assessment of the impact of the new dynamic soil albedo scheme within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) will offer tangible insights for climate model development and improved simulation of the AHP.

An operation * on the elements of a set is said to be commutative if x*y is equal to y*x for all elements x and y in the set.  For example, the usual operations of addition and multiplication on the set of real numbers are commutative, whereas the operation of division is not commutative since, for instance, 2 divided by 3 is not equal to 3 divided by 2.  Noncommutativity is an inherent phenomenon in many areas of modern mathematics and its applications. It has been a source of intricate obstacles as well as mathematical depth and beauty since J. von Neumann's formulation of quantum mechanics. The integrated program of research and education in this project is aimed at treating noncommutativity effects that arise in various problems of analysis and its applications to noncommutative geometry, mathematical physics, and operator algebras, as well as to strengthening connections between these areas of mathematics. Research and career development of students will be facilitated by workshops targeted at graduate students and junior researchers, organized in conjunction with research conferences for the broader mathematical community. University students will participate in an outreach program to enhance mathematical skills and knowledge of high school students and teachers and raise appreciation of mathematics by a general community. The research projects are vertically integrated to provide ample opportunity for student research at different levels.<br/><br/>This research project includes establishing properties of single and multivariate operator functions that are similar to classical properties of the respective scalar functions, deriving bounds for related Schur multipliers and similar transformations, describing spectral characteristics of perturbations of differential operators, understanding geometry of higher order perturbations and finding its meaning in noncommutative geometry, and describing structure of elements in operator algebras. Resolution of these problems depends on development of innovative operator theoretic methods that are expected to emerge from a synthesis of various techniques in analysis and operator theory.  The project aims to ultimately benefit areas of mathematics beyond the topics investigated in the project."

To respond to the challenges, an essential task is to identify the footprints (i.e., where and when) of these change processes. In the meantime, many spatio-temporal big datasets (STBD) such as fine-grained environmental and climate observations and detailed public transportation records are being made available to the public. Analyzing these data for urban change footprints (CHAF) helps city planners foresee and understand potential sustainability issues. However, such analyses pose significant challenges due to the non-monotonic nature of most change processes, the large cardinality of candidate patterns in STBD, and the non-trivial tradeoff between computational efficiency and pattern quality. This project will investigate automated, efficient, and effective data mining techniques for the discovery of complex CHAF patterns in urban STBD. The research outcomes are expected to enhance the ability of current STBD analytics tools to analyze change-related patterns. The computational framework proposed can be applied to solve a broad range of other problems such as pattern discovery in video and image processing. Also, the research results will be applied to real-world datasets to discover useful urban change patterns to improve the society's understanding of sustainability. Beyond research, this project will facilitate the development of a graduate level spatio-temporal data mining course at the University of Iowa, and contribute to the training of future professionals in spatial computing. The project will also integrate activities to involve undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Existing STBD analytical techniques only focus on detecting relatively simple CHAF patterns (e.g., regularly-shaped, monotonic changes), and typically report only a small number of CHAFs (e.g., the most or top-k likely changes). The research in this project will focus on the discovery of CHAF patterns that are non-monotonic temporally and irregularly-shaped spatially. The proposed techniques will also guarantee the completeness of results, i.e., report all the CHAFs in the data based on a given definition. Specifically, the following ideas will be explored in the project. (1) Designing interest measures of non-monotonic CHAFs that are statistically powerful and computation-friendly. (2) Designing algorithmic building blocks to efficiently evaluate a range of CHAF interest measure functions with similar properties (e.g., algebraic). (3) Designing a generic computational framework for sub-space enumeration that guarantees the completeness of results. In the proposed framework, the three-dimensional sub-spaces and their dominance relationships will be modeled as a novel sub-cube-based directed acyclic graph (SCB-DAG). Efficient traversal and pruning strategies on the SCB-DAG will be explored to enumerate candidate CHAFs. This research will provide theoretical and experimental evaluations on real data to validate the correctness, completeness and scalability of the proposed ideas.

With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this project will design and synthesize novel microporous materials from organic compounds through hydrogen bonding interactions. Compared with traditional microporous materials such as zeolites and activated carbons, they can be straightforwardly synthesized, characterized, regenerated and processed, and are of low cost. They can be applied to the separation and production of a number of chemicals important for energy, environmental and pharmaceutical applications. The proposed project at the University of Texas at San Antonio provides exceptional educational opportunities and facilitate extensive national/international research collaboration for underrepresented minority and women undergraduate and graduate students, helping them to prepare their future careers in academia and industry. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project aims to construct self-assembled multifunctional microporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) materials from a variety of organic building linkers with strong hydrogen bonding motifs. Two unique hydrogen bonding motifs DAT (DAT = 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazin-6-yl) and CA (CA = -COOH) are incorporated into a number of organic linkers for their construction of porous HOFs whose pores can be systematically tuned and functionalized. These novel porous materials will be examined for separations of small molecules, enantioselective separations of chiral alcohols and amines, and heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, asymmetric hydrogenation of keto esters, and asymmetric diethylzinc and alkynylzinc additions to synthesize chiral alcohols. The proposed research has significant impacts on the sustainable energy and separations of enantiopure compounds. Separation and purification of some small molecules such as C2-6 hydrocarbons, xylene and thiophene isomers are industrially very important; however, very challenging and energy-consuming. The realization of novel microporous HOF materials for the separation and purification of small molecules enhance the separation and purification efficiency and capacities of some existing separation technologies, and thus save energy costs. In terms of regeneration, microporous HOF materials are superior to other established porous materials because they can be easily recovered through simple recrystallization. The emerging of enantiopure microporous HOF materials for separations of enantiopure compounds can not only reduce the cost for the production of these important organic intermediates, but also initiate the new discoveries of these enantiopure organic intermediates for the synthesis of novel biologically active compounds, and pharmaceutical, agricultural, and fine chemicals."

The world depends upon a rapidly evolving set of modern technologies that are routinely enabled by advanced materials. Maintaining this progress requires an ever-expanding set of candidates that accompany and facilitate new designs. Currently, the research community at large is engaged in this process, and is doing so in many cases using the power of computational tools. The present activity is investigating an alternative strategy where configurational entropy - engineered by composition - is used to imagine and create a new class of solid crystals. While the approach is generic to all material types, this research focuses on oxide ceramics, with particular attention to those interesting to electronic applications. During the course of research, it is likely that new materials of importance to energy storage and microelectronic devices will result from this work.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project is exploring how configurational disorder can be engineered through composition so the entropic contributions to free energy predominate the minimization and thus stabilization process. Specific objectives include quantifying the strength of entropic stabilization, extending the stabilization concept to ternary systems, using thin film deposition techniques to quench in extreme high entropy structures, and exploring how configurational entropy can influence phase transformations. This research is an important complement to modern computation-led efforts such as the Materials Genome Initiative, which address the grand challenge of finding new materials that become the foundation of new technologies. Current indications suggest that entropic stabilization is prominent in oxides and that many new phases and thus new opportunities for new properties are present. If so, the impacts will be transformational as a new avenue for material development will be presented to the research community. A full-time graduate student and part-time (between semesters) undergraduate student is supported and mentored. The students and PI are participating in regional activities that encourage pre-college student engagement in science and engineering, and thus contribute to a robust and diverse future scientific cohort."

This project tests whether government policies of agencies outside of criminal justice are consequential for shaping law-breaking behavior. To do so, it focuses on a potentially salient but often-overlooked welfare policy that may have critical consequences for criminal behavior. Specifically, the 1996 welfare reform policies included a provision to exclude individuals convicted of drug-related felonies from receiving cash assistance and food stamps for their lifetimes (Section 115 of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996a). Nearly two decades later, it remains unclear how these policies impact criminal offending and recidivism among the individuals who no longer qualify.  Have the policies decreased deviant behavior by promoting self-sufficiency from the government dole? Alternatively, have they increased offending by eliminating critical resources to people in financially constrained circumstances? To answer these questions, this project examines the effect of these bans for recidivism outcomes, including arrests, convictions, incarcerations, and time to recidivism. It also considers whether the bans have had differential impacts depending on the benefit program, demographic subgroups, local labor market conditions, crime types, and sentencing outcomes. With criminal justice agencies facing severe financial constraints, it is critical to understand whether welfare policies are exacerbating crime and increasing prison admissions among individuals with previous convictions.  <br/><br/>Using administrative records from California, the project will employ a novel analytic method--regression discontinuity (RD) analysis--to estimate the causal impact of the bans. RD designs are considered ""quasi-experimental"" approaches that take advantage of random variation in a treatment variable to approximate pre- and post-test comparisons of experimental designs. In the case of drug-related felonies and public assistance bans, RD analysis methods address several issues that have hampered previous efforts to make causal claims about the effect of the exclusions. Using this method, the project will provide the strongest evidence to date about the impacts of the cash and food stamp bans for recidivism and will provide point estimates of cost-savings (or cost-expenditures) of the welfare policies given criminal justice consequences. In addition, the project will differentiate recidivism effects by benefit program and demographic subgroups, such as women and minorities.  It will also examine whether local labor market conditions moderate the consequences of the bans for recidivism, and whether the exclusions impact certain types of criminal behavior, such as pecuniary-related crimes, or types of sentencing outcomes, such as incarceration."

Singularities can range anywhere from black holes in astrophysics to turbulence in fluid mechanics to the accumulation of cancer cells in biomedical research. Such physical phenomena are often described by differential equations that involve time and space. Studying the qualitative behavior of the solutions of these equations frequently deepens one's understanding of the related physical problems. To study a singularity of a solution one uses a so-called blow-up procedure that allows one to focus attention near the singularity and to exploit the scaling properties that the differential equation enjoys. Because of the change in the scaling of space and time, this process leads to a new solution that is defined for all space and time, in other words to a ""global solution."" The classification of global solutions, when possible, sheds new insight into the singularity and thus into the underlying physical phenomenon. <br/> <br/>This project addresses the questions of existence, uniqueness, and  qualitative behavior of global solutions to nonlinear geometric elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations.

A classical example is the motion of the planets.  Dynamical systems arise in all areas of sciences, for instance in physics, biology, and economics.  In addition, the methods of dynamical systems can be applied to study problems in other fields of mathematics, including geometry and number theory.  There is a well-established theory of chaos that applies to dynamical systems whose nearby trajectories diverge exponentially rapidly with time (the weather is perhaps the most famous example). At the other end of the spectrum, there is regular motion, characterized by slowly-evolving families of trajectories. This research project aims to advance fundamental research on the intermediate case of weakly chaotic systems, often called parabolic. Parabolic systems are characterized by the property that nearby trajectories diverge at most polynomially rapidly with time.  Systems of this kind are especially important in geometry, number theory, and mathematical models arising in several branches of physics, including solid-state physics, celestial mechanics, and statistical mechanics.  For instance, in recent years, in number theory, and to a lesser extent, in geometry, many questions have been reformulated (sometimes solved) as questions on the dynamics of certain parabolic flows. In physics, the behavior of electrons at the Fermi surface (solid-state physics), the motion of planets near a singularity (celestial mechanics), and the motion of a confined atom (statistical mechanics) are related to parabolic systems. This project aims to develop new approaches to these important questions and will involve graduate students in the fundamental mathematical research.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems can be roughly distinguished according to the speed of divergence of nearby trajectories. Systems with sub-exponential, polynomial divergence of nearby orbits are often called parabolic. An extremely successful approach to some parabolic systems is based on renormalization, which is an effective tool whenever the system reveals itself to be at least approximately self-similar, meaning it is nearly the same when viewed at smaller and smaller scales, possibly after changing of coordinates. However, many fundamental parabolic systems, including most homogeneous flows, do not seem to possess self-similarity properties, and no renormalization method has been developed for such systems. As a consequence, the dynamical properties of these systems are very poorly understood and are rarely the subject of investigation. This project aims to build on recent results by the principal investigator and collaborators to investigate non-renormalizable systems. The guiding principle is to develop a scaling method to generalize renormalization in the absence of self-similarity.

Degradation of these materials during use is a major issue in the commercial implementation of organic semiconductors. These degradation pathways are thought to be a complex combination of effects resulting from exposure to small amounts of gases and moisture in the ambient atmosphere as well as ultraviolet radiation. With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this foundational effort allows development of sophisticated, state-of-the-art spectroscopic tools based on the interaction of light and electrons with these materials to identify the chemical pathways that accompany degradation, leading to better solutions to solve this complicated problem. This inherently interdisciplinary effort has substantial broader impact through the professional development of the graduate students involved. Graduate students conduct a portion of their dissertation research in the laboratory of the other Principal Investigator, as well as complete a 6-week internship at Next Energy Technologies, Inc. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Solid-state organic semiconductor materials are the essential active components of a variety of existing and emerging technologies, including light-emitting diode lasers and organic-based electronic and photonic devices. These technologies suffer from limited lifetimes due to the inevitable degradation of organic semiconductors through poorly defined chemical, photochemical and photophysical processes, especially in operando, or under conditions of operation. Addressing these limitations requires characterization of the molecular structural, electronic, and charge transport attributes of these organic semiconductor materials during and after degradation. Toward this end, a suite of state-of-the-art methods, including surface vibrational spectroscopies (Raman, PM-IRRAS) in ambient to ultrahigh vacuum, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), and charge mobility measurements, are used to study organic semiconductors in environments that systematically increase in chemical and optoelectronic complexity, including in operando. The primary objective of this effort is to undertake a comprehensive fundamental investigation of the chemical, photochemical, and photophysical mechanisms of degradation that underlie the diminished performance and eventual failure of organic semiconductor-based devices. The secondary impact of this effort is formulation of new design criteria for more robust organic semiconductors."

The first of these is the mathematical problem of recovering the structure of the Earth from seismic measurements. The project takes into account that the Earth is best modeled as an elastic medium; that it consist of several cores, and that it is anisotropic (i.e., that the speed of seismic signals can depend on the direction).  A second problem is motivated by applications to cosmology: to determine the stage of the early Universe, to the extent possible, from the cosmic microwave background radiation measurements. Finally, the principal investigator will study the mathematics of new medical imaging methods that use two different waves to form an image: one wave (electromagnetic, for example) is sent to the human body to excite the cells, which creates another type of wave (acoustic, for example) that one measures away from the body. In all the aforementioned examples, one is especially interested in solving local problems using local information: when measurements are done locally (say, on some part of the boundary of the relevant domain), one's desire is to recover the object locally, as well. Indeed, in many practical applications such measurements can only be done locally, and very often one is interested in the object under scrutiny only in a region near the point where the measurement is taken. The goal is to understand how much information is included in the measured data, to determine how sensitive such information is to noise and measurement errors, and to devise a means of using this data to reconstruct the object.  <br/><br/>More specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) recovery of a Riemannian metric, up to isometry, on a compact manifold with boundary near a strictly convex boundary point from localized lens/distance boundary data; (2) recovery of a Lorentzian metric up to a gauge transformation from boundary measurements; (3) recovery of both types of metrics from wave equation data on the boundary; (4) solving the inverse problem for the elastic geophysics model with piecewise smooth Lame parameters; (5) inversion of the geodesic and the light ray transforms; and (6) solving inverse source problems that arise in medical imaging. Theses include both linear and nonlinear problems, from well-posed to mildly ill-posed to ill-posed. The aim is to recover the leading term in the underlying hyperbolic equation, which determines the geometry. Unlike much previous work in the area, this project allows for the existence of conjugate points, albeit modulo some additional geometric assumptions. The problem of local recovery a Riemannian metric in boundary/lens rigidity, up to isometry, is very challenging because simple linearization does not work, and there is inherent nonuniqueness. The principal investigator expects to combine ideas from tensor tomography, Melrose's scattering calculus, and other new ideas to deal with the nonlinearity. His methods would prove global uniqueness and stability as well, under the condition that the manifold admits a strictly convex foliation. Existence of conjugate points is not excluded. The inverse problems in time-space, including the integral geometry ones, lack ellipticity because only space-like singularities are recoverable. This makes the problem ill-posed. The light ray transform is a restricted ray transform, requiring specialized microlocal tools, not even fully developed yet for nonflat metrics. Those problems are of interest in geometry (where they are called rigidity problems), in the part of the theory of partial differential equations known as inverse kinematic and inverse boundary-value problems, and in applications like geophysics."

The first takes advantage of recent and ongoing community-driven collection of broadband seismic data systematically covering more than half of North America. The second focuses on earthquake activity in the Raton Basin, which is on the New Mexico-Colorado border and an area of natural gas production and wastewater injection. Both lines of research include educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as outreach activities to improve the representation of Earth science and particularly geophysics in middle schools around Albuquerque. The goals of the first line of research will be achieved by seismic investigation of mantle structure and its implications for thermal and chemical convection processes beneath North America, with particular consideration of potential evidence for or against a substantial geochemical reservoir of water in an unusual layer about 400?700 km deep referred to as the mantle transition zone. The properties of this layer could provide new insights into limits on the evolution of surface water over Earth?s history and occurrence of partial melting as a result of ongoing convection. The second line of research will involve collection and analysis of seismic data in the Raton Basin over the duration of this project in order to test how spatial and temporal patterns and mechanisms of earthquakes respond to varying wastewater injection rates, increasing cumulative injected volume, and small natural transient stresses.<br/><br/>This project?s two main research goals are: 1) to test the hypothesis that the mantle transition zone beneath North America is a major geochemical reservoir of water and 2) constrain the time dependent response of Raton Basin seismicity to wastewater injection. Both lines of research are integrated with the educational goal of increasing participation in geoscience research among the diverse population of New Mexico students at levels ranging from middle school to graduate school. The first line of research will use a suite of interdependent analyses of EarthScope seismic data including mapping of continuous and laterally sporadic interfaces, mapping variations in the sharpness and amplitude of interfaces, and constraining the influence of 3-D velocity structure on interface imaging. Quantitative assessment of the hydrated transition hypothesis will be conducted through collaborations with mineral physicists and geodynamicists. The second line of research involves extended observation and analysis of seismicity in the Raton Basin, which has hosted an increase in seismicity correlated with increased wastewater injection. This component will enable higher resolution and longer-term observations of feedbacks between seismogenic deformation and wastewater injection. Annual class research projects and undergraduate interns will primarily conduct data collection and analysis to constrain temporal variations in the distribution of active faults, source mechanisms, magnitude distribution, and susceptibility to external triggering. Place-based education efforts at the middle school level, where many students first encounter the geosciences, will use Raton Basin and EarthScope data to enhance exposure to geoscience research and awareness of geoscience career opportunities among underrepresented populations."

These materials will initially be evaluated in courses at a four-year university (JMU) and a minority-serving two-year college (NOVA).  The community-based review, evaluation, contribution, and further testing of these modules in various types of classrooms will create a forum for sharing ideas among geoscience and STEM faculty who wish to incorporate analytical methods into courses using robust peer-reviewed online teaching resources.

Chromium is a key ingredient required for the manufacturing of stainless steel alloys, as well as a myriad of other technologically important 'super alloys'. While it is widely accepted that the chromite deposits found in layered mafic intrusions are a crystallization product of a parental magma body, the fundamental geochemical processes that induce the crystallization of chromite in the magma bodies that host these deposits are still poorly understood and the subject of much scientific debate. One of the main objectives of this study is to quantify how variables such as the chemical composition of a silicate melt and the oxidation state of the Cr dissolved in the silicate melt affect the crystallization behavior of chromite. The results generated from this study can be used to deduce the chemical circumstances under which mafic magmas become saturated with and crystallize chromite. In a broader context, the results of this study can also be applied to quantifying the oxidation state of mafic magmas.  Developing new tools to quantify the oxidation state of basaltic magmas is a foundational aspect of understanding the oxidation state of the earth?s mantle and a major step toward understanding the speciation and mobility of volatile elements between the deep earth and surficial reservoirs.   This project will support a masters or doctoral student at the University of New Mexico, as well as an undergraduate student thesis. Both of these students will be trained in state-of-the-art analytical and experimental techniques and assist in research conducted at a U.S. synchrotron facility.<br/>             <br/>Understanding chromite stability is a critical aspect of developing models for the formation mechanisms of stratiform chromite ore deposits associated with layered mafic intrusions. Chromite stability in basaltic magmas is influenced by variables such as temperature, pressure, the chemical composition of the melt, and its oxidation state (i.e. fO2). The primary objective of this study is to produce a quantitative portrait of Cr-redox behavior and chromite stability in mafic magmas and how it relates to the aforementioned variables. This study combines high temperature-pressure petrology experiments conducted at the University of New Mexico with X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements of Cr valence ratios in the experimentally grown olivine crystals and quenched melts.  The XANES measurements will be conducted at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  The phase equilibria and Cr valence data generated by this study will be used to develop a new geochemical model of chromite crystallization in mafic magmas. Furthermore, the Cr valence measurements in olivine crystals will be used to develop a new tool for assessing the fO2 of basaltic magmas. A preliminary investigation has shown that the Cr-valence in olivine records changes in fO2 that may have occurred during pheoncryst growth. In this way, Cr valence measurements in olivine may be developed into a robust, quantitative redox chronometer for magmatic systems."

This project will address the process of rapid evolutionary change by investigating whether the success and geographic spread of an introduced salamander species is the result of interbreeding with a native species. Although the introduction of non-native species is thought to lead to rapid evolution, it is still not understood how often this occurs, the factors involved, and whether this promotes the success and spread of the introduced species. Sometimes introduced species hybridize with native species and produce viable offspring that exhibit extreme trait values not present in either parental species. For example, offspring may be bigger than either parental species or have an increased tolerance to environmental stressors. Potentially, such hybrid offspring can outcompete the parental species or colonize new environments not occupied by either parental species. The production of extreme trait values due to interbreeding - transgressive segregation - is rare in viable offspring. However, when it occurs the offspring can interact with the environment in entirely new ways, leading to rapid evolutionary change. The researchers will study genetic mixing between an endangered native species, the California tiger salamander, and a closely related introduced species, the barred salamander, to test the hypothesis that transgressive segregation has led to extremely rapid evolution in the native species. Data will reveal how life history, physiology, and habitat combine to determine genetic pattern across a region where the two species overlap and hybridize. The project also includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, educational programs targeting K-12 students, and workshops for conservation managers. <br/><br/>Hybrids between Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium and A. californiense exhibit transgressive segregation with respect to body size and exhibit a broader thermal tolerance than natives. However, we still do not know whether transgressive segregation of ecologically important traits is a major factor affecting the extremely rapid spread of what are being labeled ""superinvasive"" genes into native populations. The researchers will measure and compare metabolic rates, rates of water loss, stress response to conspecific density, and thermal tolerance at multiple life stages in native, introduced, and hybrid tiger salamanders, the categories that matter for predicting spread on the real California landscape. Data on native and hybrid salamanders will be generated using a captive colony of salamanders of native and hybrid individuals. Parental, non-native salamanders will be collected from several wild populations within their native range and from an introduced population that is currently outside the zone of overlap with the native species. Information learned will then be used along with a novel population genetic simulation to generate robust mechanistic predictions of dispersal and persistence of native and nonnative genotypes within the real California landscape under current and potential future conditions."

The first aims to characterize those moduli spaces that admit a realization as the critical locus of a potential. The characterization requires the development of the formalism of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures in derived geometry and the theory of isotropic foliations. In the second project a new method will be investigated for constructing motivic orientation data on non-abelian cohomology by building explicit Lagrangian foliations and computing the associated potential functions.

Due to their complex nature, they often have subtle errors that can be exploited by malicious entities. As security flaws can have serious consequences, it is important to ensure that computer programs and cryptographic protocols achieve their security objectives. As such systems have a large (potentially infinite) number of states due to presence of malicious adversaries and the concurrent nature of Internet, `pen and paper' reasoning about their correctness is challenging. In addition to the state explosion, reasoning about correctness is also challenging within the context of security because standard security objectives such as confidentiality and privacy turn out to be hyperproperties.  The challenge lies in the fact that when reasoning about hyperproperties, one has to reason about correctness of the set of all executions of a system as a whole instead of correctness of individual executions. Therefore, the development of techniques to automate this reasoning is of vital importance, and is the research focus of this project. <br/><br/>Formally, hyperproperties generalize properties that are used to express safety and liveness guarantees in classical automated verification. A property is a set of allowable executions. A system violates a property if it exhibits an execution that is not allowed. In contrast, security objectives such as confidentiality, non-interference, privacy, and anonymity are hyperproperties. A hyperproperty is a collection of allowable sets of executions. A system violates a hyperproperty if the set of its executions is not in the collection specified by the hyperproperty. Current state-of-the art automated tools for verifying security guarantees do not scale very well as they are often aimed at certain security guarantees and often make restrictive assumptions on the systems. This project aims to develop new scalable state-of-the-art techniques in automated verification of hyperproperties by undertaking primarily three research tasks. First, we will develop and implement new symbolic algorithms for verifying finite-state systems against an expressive set of hyperproperties. The second task shall be devoted to scaling the analysis by a novel combination of automated analysis and automated counterexample generation designed specifically for hyperproperties. Finally, we shall establish theoretical results that shall reduce the problem of verifying cryptographic protocols in the presence of unbounded message sizes and nonces to the finite case.  The research aims of the proposal will be paired with curriculum development at the University of Missouri where a new concentration in security will be introduced in the undergraduate curriculum that will integrate security design with software development.  The results of this project will be integrated in the courses, and the project will support both undergraduate and graduate student research."

One example is the problem of modeling melting ice, where the interface of ice and water is determined dynamically by the distribution of temperature (i.e., the solution of the heat equation) in the water region. This project addresses some fundamental questions concerning free-boundary problems, such as the existence and long-time behavior of solutions. This is an important topic, since without a proper mathematical theory it is difficult to develop accurate and trustworthy numerical methods for dealing with concrete physical problems. A good example is the problem of liquid drops sliding on a tilted surface. In this case the shape of the drop can change drastically when the velocity is increased, and a singularity (corner) develops at the rear of the drop when the velocity exceeds a certain critical value. At higher speeds the tail of the drop may break into another component (pearling). Accurate modeling of the motion of drops is therefore a highly complex question in fluid mechanics, with many important applications in engineering. Another example is in the crowd motion of individuals or cars in congested areas exiting through part of the boundary of the confining domain (e.g., a room or a highway); in these examples, the exit pattern is heavily influenced by the shape of the domain as well as the location of the exit. The project aims towards a better understanding of the properties of these problems and seeks to provide a framework for developing accurate computer-based numerical simulations of the processes. <br/><br/>The problems studied in this project arise in a variety of physical phenomena, including the phase change between liquid and solid, the motion of capillary drops, congested crowd motion, and tumor growth. Particular focus will be on the asymptotic behavior of solutions starting with general initial data, either in the context of homogenization and long-time behavior or in the ""stiff-pressure"" limit of nonlinear diffusion. In addition to standard methods in partial differential equations, such as integral estimates, it will often be necessary to introduce geometric methods to understand the pointwise behavior of the moving interface. The first part of the project concerns volume-preserving geometric motions and their large-time behavior. The challenge lies in possible topological changes of the interface caused by the merging and splitting of fronts. For this reason most results in this area hold only for convex surfaces. The principal investigator will introduce a modified version of the moving-planes method to investigate a more general class of interfaces and to study their convergence to equilibrium. The second subproject concerns the evolution of capillary drops on a flat or tilted surface in the quasi-static approximation regime. While many models have been proposed in the study of dynamic capillary drops, the analysis of such models is still in its early stages, due the wide range of behavior with respect to parameters such as the roughness of the surface or the volume of the drop. The aim here is to address the well-posedness and long-time behavior of solutions in various regimes, to classify possible singularities, and to investigate the process's transitional behavior upon the change of parameters. The principal investigator also proposes to study the emergence of congested zones in collective motions, for example the evolution of jammed regions in crowd motions with a density constraint, or tumor growth in the motion of cancer cells with anti-crowding pressure. The plan is to characterize the motion law of the congested zones as well as to investigate the stability and long-time behavior of the solutions. Finally, the principal investigator proposes to study interface homogenization problems in random media, where the inhomogeneity is present either in the advection vector field or in the latent heat. The goal is to understand how the inhomogeneities in the system interact with the geometry of the interfaces to affect the macroscopic behavior of the solutions. New approaches will be introduced to the investigation, using tools such as energy estimates and concentration inequalities."

As they grow, tropical trees store large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide in their biomass, slowing the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and hence the pace of climate change. Yet, all trees require large amounts of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, to grow, and it remains unclear whether the supply of soil nutrients will be sufficient to meet the demands of predicted tree growth in the future. For example, soil phosphorus concentrations are relatively low in tropical forest soils, and some research suggests that low phosphorus supply may limit increases in tree growth and carbon storage. However, previous work suggests that some tropical trees may be better than others at obtaining scarce nutrients because of their relationships with soil microorganisms that enhance the ability to scavenge nutrients. This research will explore how different tropical trees access soil nutrients and whether these microbial partnerships offer some trees an advantage over their competitors. Overall, this research will improve the understanding of how tropical forests may respond to global environmental change.<br/><br/>Trees capable of symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation, a plant-microbial mutualism that converts atmospheric N into biological forms, are abundant in tropical forests. Previous work suggests that N fixing trees have an advantage over non-N fixing trees in acquiring soil phosphorus (P) via the production of N-rich phosphatase enzymes that mineralize organic P and by hosting arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that scavenge for inorganic P. This advantage could lead to competition for soil P in which N fixing trees outperform non-N fixing trees. This project will explore the interactions between N fixing and non-N fixing trees via an experimental seedling study on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica in which multiple species from each plant group will be grown alone or in competition under five P treatments that vary by the P compound being delivered. In addition, previous work suggests that this N and P interaction may not be constrained to trees that fix N, but may be evident in trees that have high foliar N regardless of fixation. Thus, foliar N may be an indirect control of P acquisition on an individual plant basis, as well as on a landscape scale if plants with similar foliar N concentrations are aggregated. Therefore, this research will also explore the relationships between foliar N, P acquisition, and the biogeochemical consequences across a set of individual emergent canopy trees and forest plots characterized by high and low foliar N. The results from both projects have the potential to elucidate complex plant-microbially mediated N and P interactions that operate above- and belowground, and on multiple spatial scales."

The mathematical system that describes the motion of a pendulum is a dynamical system. Another example is fluid dynamics, which for instance, is used to study the flow of air over an airplane wing. Often, the structure of a phase space has implications for the dynamical systems that it supports. For example, any flow on the sphere has a stationary point, which means that the corresponding dynamical system has a state that never changes. This project is concerned with the obverse of this idea: What does a flow on a space say about the space itself? The spaces we consider are 3-dimensional, like the space surrounding us; the flows are used as a tool to ""flatten"" the space into simpler 1- and 2-dimensional spaces, where the geometric structure of the original space is reflected in the symmetries of these flattened spaces. In addition to its implications within mathematics, this project has applications to applied dynamics, where the flattened spaces can be used to understand the stability of fluid flows.<br/> <br/>Quasigeodesic and pseudo-Anosov flows are product covered, which means that the orbit space in the universal cover is a topological plane. This plane has a natural circle at infinity, with an action of the fundamental group, which reflects the large-scale dynamics of the flow and the geometry of the manifold. This project uses techniques from dynamics, 3-manifolds, geometric group theory, and classical analysis situs to understand the relationship between a flow, its underlying manifold, and the circle at infinity. In particular, it aims to prove Calegari's conjecture that every quasigeodesic flow may be deformed into a pseudo-Anosov flow, characterize the circle actions that come from such flows, and use flows to understand cubulations and essential surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds."

One such alternative is alkali-activated materials (AAMs), a class of cement whose manufacture emits less carbon dioxide than Portland cement. However, the long term durability of new cementitious materials must be understood and optimized prior to employment in the construction industry. This project investigates the chemical reactions that occur during degradation of AAMs due to exposure to atmospheric carbon dioxide, a form of degradation that plagues both Portland cement and new cementitious materials. The ability to arrest the degradation reaction(s) is being explored by exploiting the stabilizing effect of magnesium on the carbonate-based reaction products (amorphous calcium carbonate). The development of durable and sustainable cementitious materials will lead to the implementation of sustainable products in residential and commercial construction industry, which will significantly reduce the associated carbon dioxide emissions. The project promotes and encourages underrepresented minorities and women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through outreach components centered on the new applied science/engineering curriculum that is being instituted in high schools in New Jersey.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project will provide a deep understanding of the complex phase formation processes that occur during carbonation-induced degradation of slag-based AAM pastes. Key objectives include (i) obtaining a fundamental understanding of the role of magnesium in stabilizing the precipitated amorphous carbonate phase and (ii) determining the short and long-term stability of the disordered phases, including calcium-(sodium)-alumino-silicate-hydrate gel and amorphous carbonates. Highly carbonation-resistant slag-based AAMs are being developed through this research, which have the potential to supplant existing cement technologies. To obtain this understanding a suite of state-of-the-art experimental techniques are being used, including training the next generation of scientists (undergraduate and graduate students) in cutting-edge research. Techniques include: micron-resolved atomic structural information obtained using X-ray pair distribution function analysis combined with micro-tomography, nanoscale elemental mapping using nano-fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and synchrotron X-ray absorption fine structure."

Improving mechanical properties of this important class of materials requires a deeper molecular-level understanding of what factors and processes affect the ultimate strength.  This project aims to establish the polymer physics on a molecular level that can be applied to provide predictive design principles on how to make stronger bulk polymeric glasses.  Specifically, theoretically motivated experiments and computer simulations will be carried out to elucidate the unique mechanical characteristics due to chain connectivity and address the questions of why polymer glasses can be ductile and how they can be made even more resistant to brittle failure.  The success of the research program will allow applications to be further broadened to increase the economical values of this class of modern engineering materials.  Since new models and concepts are expected to emerge from the research activities, the work should offer substantial advances to the general knowledge of polymer physics concerning plastics in the glassy state and enhance the curriculum of graduate education in polymer science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The project integrates various experiments with pertinent molecular-dynamics simulations to develop a conceptual framework for molecular mechanics of polymeric glasses and to search for physical principles concerning the origin of stress, the nature of stress relaxation, yielding, as well as brittle-to-ductile transition during large deformation.  The research has four objectives:  A) characterize brittle-ductile transition (BDT) in compression using both experiment and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation;  B) elucidate the origin of stress with both experiment and MD simulation including intrachain contributions;  C) depict how the chain network is able or unable to drive a polymer glass into a plastic state through activation and mobilization of vitreous segments, where experiment and simulation will explore the effect of diluting the chain network by incorporating a low molecular-weight component to make mixtures of different compositions;  D) examine how deformation at different rates and temperatures enhances molecular mobility -- can deformation always lead to enhanced segmental mobility as implied by the Eyring idea of activation? (e.g., does stress always emerge to lower the activation barrier as depicted in the Eyring formula for the molecular mobility?)  Unlike most constitutive modeling studies in continuum mechanics, this project takes a phenomenological and molecular approach to determine the prerequisites for the application of the Eyring idea (for a single particle) to such a complex many-body system as polymer glasses.  Explicitly, the research will examine the causality for yielding and ductility in polymer glasses in terms of the displacement and deformation of the chain network as causes for segmental activation and eventual macroscopic yielding."

Richter-Addo at the University of Oklahoma (OU) and Professor Michael J. Shaw at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE).  The overall goal of this research is to prepare and characterize reactive biological intermediates of relevance to the global nitrogen cycle and human health.  Emphasis is placed on the fundamental iron-mediated chemistry of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) that have been implicated in various processes such as atmospheric pollution, blood pressure control in humans, and in bacterial survival or death.  Although the simplest NOx species, namely nitric oxide (NO) is known to regulate normal blood pressure, not much is known about the generation and action of related species such as nitroxyl (HNO) and nitrosoalkanes (RNO).  This collaborative group has joint expertise in chemical synthesis and electroanalytical chemistry, and combines a Ph.D. environment (at OU) and a primarily undergraduate environment (at SIUE) to provide high-level training to a diverse group of students.  Outreach activities involving inner-city high school students from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds are an essential component of this project.<br/><br/>Heme-HNO and -hyponitrite compounds are important intermediates in the biological pathways of the overall global nitrogen cycle.  For example, bacteria convert the diatomic vasodilator molecule NO to nitrous oxide via a hyponitrite intermediate using a di-iron active site, whereas fungi perform a similar NO-to-nitrous oxide reaction using a mono-iron active site.  The fungal reaction involves initial hydride attack at a ferric heme nitrosyl to generate a heme-HNO intermediate.  This research team recently succeeded in generating a synthetic model system to demonstrate heme-HNO formation via hydride attack on a ferric heme nitrosyl, which provided an appropriate framework to determine factors that promote further reactions of these heme-HNO species.  In this project, the aims are to: (i) prepare a representative range of ferric heme nitrosyls, (ii) explore reactions involving nucleophilic attack at the bound nitrosyls to generate heme-XNO derivatives (X = H, alkyl/aryl), (iii) determine the redox behavior of these species especially those involving proton-coupled electron transfers, (iv) prepare heme model-hyponitrite compounds and establish their reactivity patterns, and (v) prepare the related heme model-NONOate derivatives to determine the factors that promote decomposition of these species to generate the vasodilator NO molecule."

A classical dynamical system is a space together with a map or flow of the space into itself.  Sometimes there is also a group of symmetries of the space.  If the group of symmetries is complicated enough, the system is often ""rigid"".   This means the important dynamical properties of the symmetries cannot be changed without destroying the entire system.  In contrast, the classical systems, with a single map or flow, are often quite flexible. This research program is aimed at understanding this flexibility.  <br/><br/>In hyperbolic dynamics there is a contrast between behavior of classical smooth systems (diffeomorphisms and flows) and actions of higher rank abelian groups. The latter, which have been at the center of the PI's research during the last decade, exhibit remarkable rigidity of behavior. Classical systems, on the other hand, are quite flexible. The principal challenge of the flexibility program is that numerical dynamical invariants can only be precisely calculated in very few cases, mostly of algebraic origin. Most known constructions are perturbative and hence at best  would allow to cover a small neighborhood of the values allowed by the model, or more often, not even that, since homogeneous systems are often ""extremal"".  So establishing flexibility calls for non-perturbative or large perturbation constructions in large families to cover possible values of invariants. This calls for a combination of methods from the theory of Lyapunov characteristic exponents, smooth ergodic theory, and geometry. While the principal problems are relatively easy to explain to a fairly broad audience of mathematicians and scientists familiar with the key notions of the modern theory of dynamical systems, the point of view is quite new and has been explicitly formulated by the PI within the last few years. A second direction of research is the further development of the rigidity program for actions of higher rank abelian groups. The combinations of techniques and insights that goes under the name ""non-uniform measure rigidity"" resulted in the almost definitive description of maximal rank actions. Those actions turn out to have an arithmetic nature from measure-theoretic and, with proper qualifications, also geometric point of view. There are non-trivial implications for the topology of manifolds that can carry such actions. The proposed research includes further study of the topology of maximal rank actions, as well as an extension of arithmeticity results to broader classes of actions whose rank is not related to the dimension of the ambient manifold. Additional directions of research deal with zero entropy systems and include several areas of study in both parabolic (polynomial complexity) and elliptic (low complexity) systems."

It is proposed to study mathematically rigorous models of electron transport near the edges of the ""forbidden zones"" and develop new approaches to the effective mass approximation. Quasiperiodic operators are examples of disordered systems which, depending on the regime, can look like pure crystals, or crystals with random impurities, while being completely deterministic. One of the models under study demonstrates random-like behavior at arbitrarily small disorder and can potentially be a suitable replacement for a random environment without having to employ a large parameter space.

The project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The activities of this research project fall into several groups distinguished by the classes of the operators under study and the types of their spectra. In the area of Anderson localization for quasiperiodic operators (""random-like behavior""), the project studies multi-particle models with analytic potentials at perturbatively large disorder and low regularity models, with the latter results expected to be non-perturbative. The methods here include operator theory, harmonic analysis, real algebraic geometry, and large deviation theorems for subharmonic or piecewise-monotonic functions. In the area of absolutely continuous spectrum (""crystalline behavior""), the project investigates the relation between low regularity reducibility of Schrodinger cocycles and strong ballistic transport for the corresponding Schrodinger operators, which, in turn, is related to transport properties of quantum spin systems. In the area of periodic operators, it is intended to study possible singularities of the Bloch varieties at the edges of spectral bands, both in 2D and 3D cases. Finally, on the more abstract side, the project aims to develop a quantitative classification of almost commuting matrices in topologically non-trivial cases, which demonstrates connections both with Cantor spectra for quasiperiodic operators and with some quantum spin systems."

In practice, the questions about solutions to these equations that we are interested in can be simple, such as what is the drag force of a boat with a given shape, or when nonlinear interference between different electro-magnetic waves becomes too serious. The answers to these simple questions can however be quite complicated, and usually depend on deep understanding of the underlying mathematical equations. These equations are nonlinear, for which our current understanding is still fundamentally incomplete. As is often the case, relatively few ``global quantities"" are already sufficient to provide satisfactory control on the most interesting aspects of the complicated solutions. It is an ultimate goal in many theoretic studies of nonlinear partial differential equations to find these quantities and the mechanism through which they control the solutions. These quantities can play an essential role in guiding practical applications of these fundamental equations, such as in the design of numerical schemes to calculate the solutions, by allowing us to focus on relatively few important parameters, while ignoring large amount of other non-essential parameters.<br/><br/>The projects on Navier Stokes focus on the following problems. 1. The regularity of axi-symmetric solutions with small initial swirl component. Since the other components can still be large, compactness arguments are not sufficient to obtain regularity and suitable dynamical control on the solution is needed.  2. The spectral assumption related to large scale invariant solutions. Such spectral assumption appears naturally in the study of large scale invariant solutions in the non-perturbative regime, and has profound applications in the uniqueness problem of Leray-Hopf weak solutions.  3. Large distance asymptotics of steady state solutions. For such problems, it is well documented that nonlinearity is important even for small solutions. The projects on energy critical nonlinear wave equations are centered around the soliton resolution conjecture for various models. For the focusing energy critical wave equation and energy critical wave map equations, the PI aims to prove the soliton resolution conjecture along a sequence of times in the non-radial case, based on recent partial results. The PI also aims to establish full soliton resolution under certain additional conditions, such as in the case of one bubble concentration, or in the radial case. Another model the PI plans to study is the defocusing energy critical wave equation with a trapping potential, in the non-radial case. In this case, basic questions such as the ``ground state conjecture"" are still open. More interestingly, it appears that one can now describe rigorously the generic and non-generic behavior of solutions in a non-perturbative regime. The PI plans to address some of these questions."

This project will make use of controlled experimental stream channels to separate how physical disturbances associated with high flows and increased contaminant exposure affect the productivity of stream ecosystems. In small streams, almost all of the productivity is associated with organisms living on the stream bed. Stream beds vary in their stability, or susceptibility to disturbance, largely due to the mixture of streambed materials including the sizes of sediments and rocks. The researchers will compare the rates of recovery and compositions of streambed communities in experimental channels following exposure to storm flows. The experimental treatments will involve different doses of common urban contaminants added to the stream water and adjusting the size of sediments within the streambed. The researchers will train a high school student from a rural community in New York in research, develop a lesson plan for high school environmental science students, and engage the public through a research website and professional meetings. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to experimentally measure the independent and interactive effects of physical (pulse) and chemical (press) disturbance on aquatic ecosystem productivity.

There is little light in the ocean at depths inhabited by these squid during daytime, and visual features such as coral and rocks are non-existent. Novel color-change behaviors in Dosidicus include repetitive whole-body ""flashing,"" used for signaling between individuals of this species, and chaotic ""flickering"" that may underlie camouflage in the open ocean. Although these dynamic behaviors contrast with the more static patterns typical of coastal species, squids of both families employ temporal and spatial patterning to varying degrees. It is therefore likely that basic mechanisms for controlling the chromatophore network are the same in most, if not all, squids. ""Vertical"" control from the brain to the chromatophore muscles is known in the coastal squids, and may account for most chromatophore-based behaviors in those species, but behaviors like flickering in deeper-water species may be more influenced by processes within the skin itself that permit changes in chromatophores to spread from one to another without directly involving the nervous system. This hypothetical pathway would define a ""horizontal"" or distributed control system in the periphery that would permit autonomous behavior within the chromatophore network. This issue is the primary significance of the project. Understanding the fundamentals of horizontal control of chromatophores has the potential of being transformative to the field, because the current paradigm is that all control is directly exerted by the brain. Horizontal control is relevant to blood delivery to local tissues by circulatory systems, gut function and nervous system micro-circuits in vertebrates. Therefore, results from this project would also influence understanding of local control more broadly. From a wider perspective, results of this project will provide insight into the interactions of distributed (horizontal) and top-down (vertical) control mechanisms, a subject relevant to the general ability of complex systems to generate non-predictable, emergent phenomena. This concept is of fundamental interest to a broad sector of society, ranging from engineering to economics to politics.<br/><br/>An integrated approach will permit testing the hypothesis that control of the chromatophore network in squid involves peripheral mechanisms that are distinct from the neuronal motor-control pathway that descends from the brain. Spontaneous chromatophore activity that is independent of canonical neural control will be isolated by experimental manipulations in coastal loliginid squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), including chronic denervation and pharmacological block of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. In addition, a comparative approach will take advantage of an oceanic ommastrephid species, Dosidicus gigas, in which spontaneous, tetrodotoxin-resistant chromatophore activity is extremely prominent. Relevant methods involve molecular transcriptomics, cellular electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy. Specific aims are: 1) identify molecular and physiological properties of relevant ion channels and receptors that control excitability in the radial muscle fibers that operate individual chromatophore organs; 2) define structural, molecular and physiological features of coupling mechanisms between muscle fibers of neighboring chromatophores that define an excitatory transmission pathway within the skin; 3) elucidate the inhibitory role in controlling spontaneous chromatophore activity played by serotonin; 4) carry out parallel experiments in Dosidicus, a member of a family of ecologically important squid in which cellular studies of chromatophores have never been carried out. This project will support undergraduate and graduate student training, and includes significant efforts to involve students from groups underrepresented in STEM."

This project contemplates the following goals and approaches: (1) implementing the first electrochemical systematic study of non-aqueous ion intercalation on well-defined graphene electrodes by controlling the number of layers and interfacial electrostatic interactions via micro- and nanofabrication, (2) using in situ neutron reflectometry, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical microscopy methods to yield new insights into the intercalation mechanisms of alkaline ions on few layer graphene and the effects of surface modifications, and (3) using density functional theory for understanding quantitatively the energetic components of the electrostatic and electronic interactions and its coupling to innovative force field terms.  The knowledge generated by this activity enables the use of simple electrostatic effects for tuning the energetics of ion insertion, potentially improving conditions for electrical energy storage, and establishing broad correlations between electrostatic effects and ionic interfacial and bulk reaction mechanisms that are extendable to other 2D-materials."

Power electronics ensure that the maximum power is drawn from the solar module even if lighting conditions change. Printing electronics from solution is an additive process that could offer cost, energy and materials savings when compared to lithographic processes. For the power electronics, printed passive components'inductors, capacitors, and resistors will be integrated with silicon chips to ensure maximum performance in a flexible form factor. The intended solar modules will be printed from water-based inks eliminating the health and environment risks posed by typical organic solvents used in printed organic electronics. This project has the potential to take the necessary steps for the field of organic electronics, specifically organic photovoltaics, to evolve from single idealized devices to a low-cost mature technology. Emerging fields such as flexible and wearable electronics require a reliable manufacturing process for power supply and this work will impact flexible power harvesting systems and their integration with a load device. The proposed activities are addressing one of the biggest challenges of organic electronics: reliable manufacturing of flexible integrated devices for a specific application. <br/>Technical:<br/>In order to accomplish such a low-cost environmentally friendly energy harvesting system, this work will focus on three tasks. The first task is ink formulation for the components of the integrated power system. The aqueous inks for the active layer in the solar module will consist of nanoparticles fabricated using a mini-emulsion method. The work will characterize the variables in the fabrication process, using a combination of size, absorption, and electrical measurements to determine the compositions of materials that provide ideal morphology for photovoltaic performance. Polymers with different functional groups have been selected to determine how functional groups, which are known to affect a polymer's solubility and surface energy, also affect nanoparticle size and stability in water. Ink formulation will also take place for power electronic components, such as capacitors. The goal is to achieve high specific capacitance while maintaining fabrication reproducibility. The second task is to develop printing methods for polymer solar cells from aqueous inks and power electronic components. Blade coating and screen printing will be used for polymer solar cells and power electronics, respectively. Printed passive components will be developed, studied and characterized for maximum power point tracking, so that the solar cells may be operated efficiently in various irradiances. The third task is to integrate the organic solar cell modules with power electronics. Monolithically integrated solar modules will be designed and fabricated by printing series-connected solar cells, and the performance of the solar modules and maximum power point tracking circuit will be characterized under realistic practical conditions. The goal is to design a photovoltaic energy harvesting system that will perform at its maximum efficiency at both indoor and outdoor light intensities, with the intent of use with loads spanning a range of sensors, in addition to portable and wearable devices. In addition to these tasks, the project will utilize environmentally friendly methods to address the challenge presented by the use of organic solvents in a manufacturing process. For the outreach program it is planned to develop science modules for use with middle school students. The project will involve two REU programs, with one designed to involve community college students in the proposed research."

These materials will initially be evaluated in courses at a four-year university (JMU) and a minority-serving two-year college (NOVA).  The community-based review, evaluation, contribution, and further testing of these modules in various types of classrooms will create a forum for sharing ideas among geoscience and STEM faculty who wish to incorporate analytical methods into courses using robust peer-reviewed online teaching resources.

These units will include gas and water plumbing, petrographic microscopes, thin sectioning equipment, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman and infrared spectroscopies.  Scientific inquiry skills will be embedded into the content modules, and will include creating and testing protocols, evaluating data quality and error, and synthesizing data.  To benefit the larger geosciences and STEM community, the modules will be published on an open educational resource (OER) courseware site.  Module structure and content will align with active, inquiry-based learning theories, and will include video mini-lectures, individual and group quizzes and assignments, expository materials in video or animation formats, video tours of equipment and laboratories, and instructor resources.  This project will improve geosciences and STEM learning by establishing effective practices for integrating open educational resources into research-based instructional units in geoscience and STEM courses involving the use of analytical equipment.  The assessment plan will include formative and summative evaluations of student learning and attitudes within required and elective courses in geosciences and STEM at JMU and NOVA, as well as module reviews by geoscience community members outside of these institutions.  Evaluation will focus on the effects of open educational resources and a blended learning course format upon student retention of analytical methods and instrumentation skills, student mastery of scientific inquiry skills, and student attitude and competencies towards conducting research with analytical equipment.  The protocol established by this study will be used to create additional modules on other analytical techniques in the future, and will be a template the STEM community may use to develop other online learning resources."

These applications also depend on a rigorous means of assessing tree inference uncertainty; the Bayesian framework provides a principled means of assessing and integrating out this uncertainty. The currently available Bayesian algorithmic tools are not capable of performing inferences on large modern data sets, which also may be continually changing as new sequencing results become available. In particular, state-of-the-art methods are almost exclusively based on random-walk Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using uniformly selected local moves, even though most of these local moves will substantially worsen even a mediocre tree. Convergence problems with this approach are well documented, and thus current methods are limited to around 1000 sequences, a number much smaller than the size of microbial and immune data sets relevant to modern biomedicine. In addition, all current methods require inference to be started from scratch each time the sequence data changes. The broader impacts of this work will extend in three directions: enabling novel applications of Bayesian phylogenetics, stimulating new areas of computer science research, and attracting new talent to the field.<br/><br/>Applications of phylogenetics, in particular Bayesian phylogenetics, are being significantly held back by computational limitations.  High-throughput sequencing technologies can return millions of sequences for studies of the human microbiome, viruses, oceanic microbes and antibody-making B Cells but theses cannot be handled with current methods.  The models also need to be more realistic, without assumptions of independent interactions.  Understanding the shape of multidimensional phylogenetic likelihood surfaces in detail might help to improve the topology.  The teams will also investigate when an optimal tree on a taxon sets contains the optimal tree on a taxon subset.  These will help to expand the approach to phylogenetic inference. These algorithmic insights will be incorporated into publicly available inference packages with a goal to provide inference on an order of magnitude more taxa than currently possible."

The industry standard and most commonly studied piezoelectric is Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT). A major concern in PZT is the lead, which puts manufacturing workers at risk and, introduces hazardous waste into the environment upon disposal of PZT-based components. The necessity for new piezoelectric materials clearly exists, but there is currently no good substitute for PZT. Many studies of PZT have led to a detailed understanding of how the crystal structure contributes to the enhanced properties, but little is known about the structures of its lead-free counter parts, slowing their development for use in applications. The aim of this study is to investigate the fundamental structure-property relationships in two key lead-free piezoelectric materials. The research provides a fundamental understanding that aids in the development of benign piezoelectric materials to improve the sustainability of electronic devices. This project is also strongly committed to expanding the opportunities available in student education and works to recruit and retain young scientists in science and engineering fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS:<br/>This research advances the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in piezoelectric ceramics. The goal of this project is to assess the local distortions from the average structure of two well-known lead-free piezoelectric materials at their morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and correlate the structural information to observations of the measured properties. Ba,Ca(Zr,Ti)O3, the most promising lead-free piezoelectric material to date, and BaTiO3-BiInO3, a system with a non-traditional MPB are being investigated. Systems are being studied both poled and unpoled to examine the structural changes under real conditions. These detailed structural studies utilize X-ray and neutron diffraction as well as EXAFS, with analysis using the Pair Distribution Function method and Reverse Monte Carlo modelling. In addition, this project aims to recruit and retain young scientists in STEM fields and train graduate students to excel in their careers. Graduate students are participating in the Lens of the Market program to learn how to translate their sustainable research ideas to innovation with the purpose of solving market problems. Freshman and sophomore undergraduates will be given the opportunity to work in the lab and gain the early research experiences that result in increased retention in the STEM fields. High school women and minority students in the Summer Experience in Science and Engineering for Youth (SESEY) summer program will participate in sustainable piezoelectric research to become engaged in the nation's science and engineering enterprise."

Focused primarily on solving polynomial equations, algebraic geometry is an ancient subject that plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and applied. It is a linchpin of modern number theory, a heavy hammer of contemporary cryptography, and a crucial input into the computer vision systems that are transforming geography, archaeology, medicine, the automotive industry, and consumer smartphones. While it continues to expand its abstract foundations in astounding new directions, algebraic geometry is also cutting new paths into data science, statistics, and machine learning. The questions under study in this project attack both ends of this spectrum. One part of the project will focus on problems related to so-called Torelli theorems, which seek to capture and quantify the essential linearity of algebro-geometric objects, and on the Brauer group, which is an object that tightly binds algebraic geometry to mathematical physics, non-commutative algebra, and number theory. A second part of the project aims to broaden the algebro-geometric foundations of computer vision, bringing new approaches to deep problems that lie at the heart of cutting-edge applications of computer vision.<br/><br/>The first part of this research project concerns Torelli theorems and focuses on Torelli-type statements for various mixtures of derived categories and Chow theory, building on the investigator's earlier work with collaborators. This is one way of trying to get Torelli theorems in a positive characteristic setting, and the underlying ideas have already paid dividends related to the Tate conjecture for surfaces over finite fields. Research on the Brauer group aims at new degeneration methods via semistable reduction of maximal orders and universality questions for rational Brauer groups of projective spaces. The goal is to gain structural insight into Brauer classes and attack several old problems, such as the cyclicity conjecture. The part of the project on computer vision will introduce functorial methods into the study of multiview reconstruction and resection, leading to new ways of compactifying the natural incidence correspondences that occur in these problems. The work aims to help lay new flexible foundations for algebraic geometry in computer vision that will advance the relationship between the subjects."

Mechanical systems achieve a state of lowest energy by giving off energy to the environment. Likewise, local disturbances in a thermodynamic system, such as temperature fluctuations in a room, tend to even out; i.e., the system relaxes towards a thermal equilibrium. However, there are instances where due to external influences, systems do not tend towards an equilibrium. A famous example is a piece of metal that is heated on one end and cooled at the other. In this case, the system does not relax into equilibrium but remains in a steady state as heat flows from the hot to the cold end. The objective of this proposal is to describe these states in terms of various mathematical models ranging from basic optimization problems to large systems of interacting agents.  We will consider optimization problems that are important in mathematics or ubiquitous in descriptions of physical phenomena, such as superconductivity. Our goal is to answer questions such as: How fast does a large system equilibrate or tend towards a steady state? What are the properties of these equilibria? If a system has some underlying symmetry, do equilibria have the same symmetry? The fascinating aspect of this research area is that problems run the gamut from ones that can be solved using standard methods to those that need considerable ingenuity for their solution. These characteristics also make it an ideal training ground for graduate students.<br/><br/>The analysis of systems out of equilibrium is still a wide open field; e.g., the interaction of a physical system with heat baths is not well understood. Such systems do not tend towards equilibrium but instead towards a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). The PI proposes to examine such phenomena within the frame work of master equations.  One of the research goals is to find Lyapunov functions that allow to control the approach towards an NESS. The investigation of such systems often leads to variational problems for the gap as well as for the entropy production, and their solution requires functional inequalities. It is important to prove these inequalities in their sharp form and to know all functions for which there is equality. One direction of research is to investigate such inequalities using flows which is the idea of  Lyapunov functions in reverse. This method has been successful in some highly non-trivial cases and it is expected that it will deliver not only sharp inequalities but also additional correction terms. The Polaron model which describes an electron interacting with the vibrations of a crystal, fits into this framework as well. This is one of the simplest examples of a quantum field theory. The strong coupling limit of the energy is well understood and it is proposed to study the more subtle problem, namely the strong coupling limit of the electron density."

He will consider the context of CR maps of a Levi nondegenerate hypersurface into a nondegenerate hyperquadric of higher dimension. This study will enhance our understanding of the CR submanifold structure of the hyperquadrics, which constitute the flat models in the theory of Levi nondegenerate hypersurfaces. The proposed work should also provide insight into how the local CR geometry of such hypersurfaces (in principle completely encoded in the CR curvature tensor) affects various properties, such as notions of nondegeneracy and rigidity, of their CR maps. Ebenfelt will also continue his study of CR maps between generic submanifolds of infinite type by investigating the prolongation of the system defining CR maps to a singular Pfaffian system on the jet bundle. He will, in particular, focus on understanding the recently discovered phenomenon that for infinite type hypersurfaces the biholomorphic, formal, and smooth CR equivalence classifications are different. He will also study a conjecture regarding finite jet determination of local automorphisms. These investigations are expected to shed new light on the nature of CR maps between infinite type manifolds, and lead to a better understanding of the Pfaffian systems arising in this context. Ebenfelt will also continue his work on normal forms for infinite type hypersurfaces in complex 2-space. Finally, Ebenfelt will study CR invariants on unit circle bundles over Khler manifolds, specifically Cartan's umbilical tensor in the 3-dimensional case and those arising in the expansions of the Bergman and Szeg kernels. He intends to develop new methods for detecting umbilical points on general 3-dimensional CR manifolds, and resolve an open problem regarding existence of umbilical points on compact CR manifolds embedded in complex 2-space."

Such data is common in genomics and neuroimaging; the new techniques will be used to identify potential genomic drug targets, to model genetic and brain networks, and for brain decoding from neuroimaging and neural recordings data. We will also use Kronecker product covariances to develop new multivariate analysis models for coupled matrix and tensor data.  These techniques will be used to find joint patterns in integrative genomics data and find patterns of brain activity indicative of behavioral or clinical covariates.

There is currently no technology that could provide this amount of energy storage with acceptable safety, lifetime, and cost. Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries are more promising than lithium-ion batteries for large-scale storage based on their earth-abundant resources and lower raw material cost. However, the lifetime of current sodium-ion technology is limited by inefficient interfaces between solid and liquid materials inside the battery. With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this project will develop better understanding of this interfacial chemistry. The results will allow researchers to design materials that last longer and to predict the lifetime of those materials much faster than traditional methods. The educational benefits of the project include graduate and undergraduate researcher training in electroanalytical chemistry, battery science, microfabrication, and reactor design. The PI has also partnered with a local high school's chapter of Girls Who Code to introduce high school students to electronics and engineering design.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Insufficient passivation from the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI), a surface film at the electrode/electrolyte interface, limits the lifetime of sodium-ion batteries. Even basic understanding of how the SEI forms, grows, and transports charges is severely lacking. This work will apply an innovative combination of microfluidic reactors, electrochemical generator-collector experiments, and redox mediator studies in order to develop methods for critical insight into the form and function of the SEI. Reducing reactor volume mimics the surface:volume ratio of a real battery while the well-defined convection field is still amenable to transport and kinetic analysis. This unconventional approach controls the residence time of the electrolyte degradation reactions and can be used to map passivation efficiency to the concentration and chain-length of solubilized oligomers. The microflow reactor also permits electrochemical generator-collector experiments to amperometrically detect reaction products. Such four-electrode measurements are not possible in a normal battery and will permit the amperometric detection of soluble degradation products and mediator studies of charge transport and reaction in the SEI. Patterned carbonaceous electrodes in model geometries will be synthesized by controlled oxidation of pyrolyzed photoresist. These electrodes will be characterized spectroscopically and microscopically in order to relate their electrochemical performance to the nature of the carbon surface. The results of the study will impact both existing and emerging materials for sodium-ion batteries by determining how carbon surface chemistry can be used to control both the catalysis of desirable SEI products and their effective precipitation into stable films."

Ions are charged atomic or molecular species that can dissolve in solvents like water or organic liquids.  Ions are important in a very broad range of natural and technological systems.  Table salt is the most common everyday example, but ions of many kinds figure prominently in electrochemistry, colloids, surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors).  Not all ions are the same; in fact, the ion identity (through its size, shape, and chemistry) can dramatically affect the properties of a given system.  The focus of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of what causes such large differences between ionic species.  This research aids in developing more accurate models for how the ions interact with solvents such as water or organic liquids (such as ethylene carbonate, the solvent in the lithium (Li)-ion batteries used in every electronic device).  Towards this end, Beck and his coworkers employ accurate models that come from the fundamental theory of nature, quantum mechanics.  Their goal is to learn about basic aspects of ion solvation and then produce reliable models that can help understand problems like atmospheric chemistry and the development of longer-lasting batteries.  The educational component of this project centers on continued development of a course on sustainable energy.  Professor Beck is currently the chair of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users. <br/> <br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental aspects of ion solvation in water and organic solvents.  Ion solvation figures prominently in surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors).  Beck and his coworkers aim to establish a fundamental energy scale for single-ion solvation.  This allows for a firmer groundwork for studying specific ion effects.  The research also leads to the development of better classical models that can be applied to much larger systems such as sea salt aerosols and improved batteries.  The behavior of ions near interfaces is an essential aspect of all of these problems.  The research has four objectives: to study ions in water, in organic solvents, and in biological channels, and to further develop a new stochastic algorithm for quantum simulations on parallel computers.  The study of ions in water leads to the accurate prediction of the effective surface potential of water, a long sought quantity in condensed phase chemistry.  This work employs ab initio quantum simulations and quasi-chemical theory to obtain quantitative estimates of the bulk and real hydration free energies.  The study of ions in organic solvents applies the same ideas to ions in ethylene carbonate, a key electrolyte in Li-ion batteries.  That research improves current models for these systems.  The study of ions in biological channels examines the interaction of protons and chloride ions in the bacterial CLC channel protein.  The development of stochastic algorithims may lead to a new forward-looking algorithm for large-scale quantum simulations. The method employs stochastic differential equations to solve for the one-particle density matrix.  Besides the scientific impacts, the research broadly impacts education through development of a course on sustainable energy and leadership of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users."

They are believed to replace traditional incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs for displays and lighting luminaires. While the brightness and stability of light-emitting diodes have greatly improved over the past decade, cost per diode still remains relatively high. This has become a bottleneck limiting their wide market penetration. This project aims to develop a revolutionary technology that can employ scalable printing processes to fabricate large area light-emitting diodes with high throughput. No existing light-emitting diodes can be printed due to the demand for a multilayer device architecture. In contrast, the proposed devices utilize an extremely simplified single-layer device structure. Such a distinctive approach opens up a novel path towards obtaining fully printed light-emitting diodes, in which every single fabrication step may be performed by printing. The project will focus on the material chemistry and process development that will eventually lead to the manufacturing of light-emitting diode displays and light panels on both rigid and flexible substrates. Such advancements will greatly reduce the cost of light-emitting diode products, while allowing for greater energy savings in multiple application fields especially where large area and diffused light are both desired such as: solid state lighting, information displays and illuminated wallpapers.<br/>Technical:<br/>The new generation light-emitting diodes are based on organometal hybrid perovskites, an emerging class of semiconducting materials that can be readily dissolved in an organic solvent and crystalized into luminescent thin films after solvent evaporation. The perovskites are mixed with a polymer to control the crystallization dynamics and morphology of the resulting light-emitting thin films. The first research task is to optimize the nucleation and growth of light-emitting perovskite crystals in polymer matrices, and obtain the optimal perovskite morphology for light-emitting applications. The optimal morphological structure will be determined by measuring the opto-electronic properties of the composite and determining the efficiency and brightness. This will allow the characterization of relationships between different structures and properties of the materials and design scientific models to describe the compositing process. Once the structure property relations between the perovskite materials and polymers have been fully determined the results will be used as a scientific basis to make LEDs of various colors; as well as improving the environmental stability of those devices. The final step of the project will be investigating the rheological behaviors of the perovskite polymer solutions and optimize the processing techniques to produce uniform, large area light-emitting thin films. The process resolution will simultaneously be investigated to allow pixel size features to be created. This work would allow for establishing a novel type of light-emitting technology on the market. In addition the work will enhance the fundamental understanding of the structure-process-property relationship of perovskite emitters. Such knowledge is crucial for the rational design and optimization of perovskite light-emitting diodes for achieving large area and low cost displays and light panels."

In its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory, and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in theoretical physics: studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is changing in space-time. One of the foci of this project is on compact moduli spaces, which give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially different from others.  The investigator is also involved in promoting mathematics to high school students; he and fellow directors of the Summer Institute for Mathematics at the University of Washington make special efforts to involve women at all levels of the program, from students through teaching assistants to instructors, to reinforce their leadership roles in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project concerns several topics in higher dimensional algebraic geometry, especially moduli theory and singularities. The overarching theme of the research is centered on compact moduli spaces of stable log varieties, an important area that is still in the developmental stage. In particular, even the correct moduli functor needs to be identified, and most of the research is motivated by understanding the basic properties of these moduli spaces. This involves understanding the singularities that can occur on stable log varieties. Important classes of singularities in this regard are that of rational singularities and other singularities of the minimal model program. The investigator will work on advancing our currently very limited understanding of these singularities in arbitrary characteristic. The project also aims to develop cohomological methods to deal with rational pairs and thrifty resolutions in arbitrary characteristic. In particular, the investigator will study logarithmic versions of Hodge cohomology and of Grothendieck's fundamental class. Also stemming from the moduli project, the investigator plans to study properties of Du Bois singularities and Du Bois pairs. The main objectives of this part of the project are to develop a definition of these singularities that makes sense in arbitrary characteristic and to prove a subadjunction theorem for rational and Du Bois pairs."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports the interdisciplinary training and research of a young scholar at the intersection of the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, and public health to explore the tradeoffs in childhood energy allocation and the impact of market economy on health. The way in which children manage energetic resources and respond to changing environmental conditions remains unclear. All of life's essential tasks -- maintenance, growth, reproduction, immune function, and physical activity -- require energy (i.e., calories), and it is often assumed that organisms allocate resources to these competing demands in a manner that maximizes fitness. This framework of energy allocation and tradeoffs has been widely applied to understand human biological variation. However, few studies have tested its validity among children. Addressing this limitation, the present project integrates methods and perspectives from multiple disciplines to investigate the nature of childhood energy use through the lens of allocation tradeoffs. It also applies this new synthesis to explore an important real world problem: the impact of market integration on child ontogeny and health. Utilizing a novel study design among the Shuar of Amazonian Ecuador, we pursue two primary research questions. (1) Do energetic tradeoffs exist between childhood growth, physical activity, and immune function as predicted by the energy allocation model? (2) Is market integration associated with changes in childhood energy allocation that promote overweight/obesity and poor cardiovascular health? Results will have significant implications for several scientific areas. They will also be used to develop effective health policy and relief aid in Ecuador and the United States. Promoting opportunity for training, this work involves numerous indigenous educational health forums and significant research experience for minority American undergraduates. Importantly, the project also provides scientific and professional training and for the Fellow, preparing him for a career as an independent researcher at the forefront of integrative biological science.<br/><br/>Despite the success of previous studies investigating human biological variation using evolutionary life history theory, important gaps in our understanding of human phenotypic plasticity and energy use remain. Few studies have investigated energetic tradeoffs among children or have explored the potentially important role of physical activity in child energy dynamics. No previous life history research has incorporated accurate measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting energy expenditure (REE) into study designs, preventing assessment of several critical assumptions of the life history tradeoff model. Directly addressing these limitations, the present project aims to test the validity of the energetic tradeoff model and apply this framework to investigate the role of tradeoffs in relationships between Shuar market integration, ontogeny, and child health. We employ a novel two-week longitudinal study design among 100 Shuar children (age 5-10 years) living in two communities differing greatly in level of market integration, lifestyle, and diet. Gold standard metabolic measures of child TEE (doubly labeled water), REE (indirect calorimetry), and physical activity energy expenditure (doubly labeled water and accelerometry), as well as robust measures of weekly linear growth (knemometry), immune activity (finger-prick blood C-reactive protein, total Immunoglobulin E, and total Immunoglobulin G), cardiovascular health (finger-prick blood glucose and lipids), and energy intake and market integration (observation and interviews) will be made from each participant, supporting between-community, between-individual, and within-individual analyses of energy use and tradeoffs. This work has the ability to address many underexplored areas of research, including the relative importance of energy intake versus energy expenditure in the etiology of overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease, the precise energetic costs of human immune activation, and, importantly, the overall validity of the life history tradeoff model."

At least 50% of participants will be expected from the underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>This three-year US-China IRES program will involve American undergraduate students in developing novel LED-based wireless visible light communication (VLC) and positioning (VLP) systems. Building upon the on-going research at the University of California Center for Ubiquitous Communications by Light (UC-Light), the IRES students will be directed to conduct the following research tasks in team with their Chinese counterparts: (1) develop an LED-based VLC testbed systems, (2) design integrated circuit (ICs) for VLC/VLP systems, (3) develop LED-based real-time tracking systems, (4) investigate broadband graphene-based optical modulators for VLC systems, and (5) design electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for high-reliable LED VLC/VLP systems. The LED VLC/VLP technologies developed is potentially a revolutionary alternative to existing RF-based wireless communication and navigation technologies, addressing its technical limitations. The participating American students will be trained to be technically competitive and globally enabled for their future careers."

They work with soil testing companies, crop consulting firms, and fertilizer and chemical retailers, but the shortage of precision agriculture educational opportunities limits the ability of businesses to hire qualified employees and forces them to use their limited resources on incumbent worker training. In addition, the gap between industry need and existing training leads to graduates having to retrain or take additional courses even though they have already earned a general agriculture degree. By offering an enhanced curriculum to high school and college students, this project at Parkland College in Illinois will educate a wide variety of agriculture workers in line with industry needs as it provides a robust education and training program to support the vital agricultural industry of Illinois and the United States. A focus of the project is on increasing the number of women in precision agriculture, which will strengthen and diversify an emerging American industry. The deliverables and best practices developed through the project will be disseminated through coordination with the ATE National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence, Clark State Community College in Springfield, OH, and agricultural education conferences.<br/><br/>Jobs in precision agriculture require a unique combination of technical and agricultural expertise that is not widely available for high school and college students. Due to the highly technical nature of precision agriculture jobs, the curriculum in the field is often outdated and does not fully prepare students for available positions. Enhancing precision agriculture curriculum for two-year colleges and connecting this curriculum with high schools and four-year colleges will dramatically improve the preparedness of technicians in a number of agricultural sectors. It will utilize the existing precision agriculture curriculum as the foundation for an enhanced program including a more comprehensive associate degree, updated articulation agreements, and the development of dual-enrollment content for area high schools. These components will create a 2+2+2 structure that will be replicable in other regions and sustainable. The project will utilize emerging technologies in conjunction with agronomy to enhance precision agriculture education and will be developed in close partnership with local and regional employers.

The NSF Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry fund this award jointly. The award supports computational research and education on the mechanical and electronic properties of black phosphorene. Black phosphorene is a material composed of elemental phosphorous that has been discovered and synthesized only recently. It is very similar to graphene, it forms a two-dimensional sheet, but it offers a significant advantage in that it behaves as a semiconductor: it exhibits a sizeable energy gap while supporting at the same time high-mobility charge carriers. In addition, it turns out that the electronic properties of black phosphorene can be readily tuned by applying mechanical stress and other methods. Therefore, just as silicon emerged as an ideal material for three-dimensional electronics, black phosphorene seems to emerge as the ideal infrastructure material for two-dimensional electronics technology. <br/><br/>The principal goal of this project is to study, understand, and eventually predict the properties of black phosphorene and its derivatives using theoretical and computational methods. Because of the way two-dimensional black phosphorene responds to mechanical stresses and to chemical perturbations, studying its properties using conventional computational methods is a highly challenging task, requiring the simulation of exceedingly large systems. Therefore, the first challenge the project will need to overcome is to build a computational tool that tackles large electronic systems containing thousands of atoms, and apply it to the study of black phosphorene. This challenge can be met by using methodologies developed by the PIs that can generally be described as stochastic computational techniques. These approaches are akin to statistical methods used in polling, and make it possible to accurately simulate material properties for much larger systems than is possible with traditional, non-stochastic approaches. Once the tools are developed, the PIs will use them to study realistic two-dimensional black-phosphorene sheets, providing a theoretical framework for fundamental understanding and for guiding future experiments on this material.<br/><br/>The theoretical tools developed and used in this project will be made available to the community, with an aim to increase access to the developed methodology.

The NSF Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry fund this award jointly. The award supports computational research and education on the mechanical and electronic properties of black phosphorene. Traditional large-scale simulations of these properties are prohibitively expensive either for accurate density functional theory with exact exchange (DFT), or for highly accurate electronic structure methods based on Green's function (GW). This project will explore hitherto inaccessible regimes using the stochastic formulations of traditional DFT and GW. The stochastic formulations replace some, or all of the multitude of summations over orbitals inherent in electronics structure methods with a stochastic sampling of combinations of these orbitals. The stochastic approaches are designed to calculate from first principles the atomic and electronic structure of systems containing 10,000 atoms or more. Sizes of that magnitude are necessary for establishing realistic environments, which enable the study of anisotropic properties. Such capability allows the construction of a theoretical framework for fundamental understanding of black phosphorene, which in turn will help in guiding experiments and synthetic efforts by pointing out possible directions to achieve desired properties. <br/><br/>The unique ability to accurately simulate large black-phosphorene systems allows the exploration of electronic structure under a variety of experimental conditions, which include temperature, strain, and optical excitation. Using a combination of stochastic DFT and Langevin dynamics, the structure and phonon dispersion curves of large, layered black-phosphorene nanoribbons and nanotubes will be investigated, with and without mechanical stress. The structure of defects and adsorbates on the surface and perimeters will be studied as well.<br/><br/>The theoretical tools developed and used in this project will be made available to the community, with an aim to increase access to the developed methodology.

Intercalation is usually a reversible process that involves the introduction of a guest species into a host electrode material. The realization that lithium is a limited resource, which potentially can result in a significant increase in the cost of lithium-ion batteries, has shifted research directions towards investigation of alternate intercalation systems, such as sodium-ion batteries. However the larger size and higher weight limits intercalation and diffusion of sodium ions through common electrode materials, compared to lithium ion. This results in significant electrode degradation (thereby resulting in capacity loss after the first cycle and reduced cycle life) and limitations in operation at high current rates. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the Division of Materials Research, this project focuses on addressing these shortcomings through chemical pre-intercalation of the specific types and amounts of inorganic ions. The proposed work has the potential to enable the development of sodium-ion battery cathodes that can be used to replace current lithium-ion batteries, providing sustainable energy storage that is cheaper, reliable, and environmentally friendly, contributing to the development of next-generation energy storage systems for transportation, grid-storage and other renewable energy applications. The project offers an excellent opportunity to engage senior undergraduate and graduate students in masters and doctoral-level research in the field of Materials Science and Engineering and its broader impact on Materials Chemistry and Electrochemistry. The principal investigator plans to integrate the results of this research in the course on materials for energy storage applications. This project enhances the dissemination of knowledge to a broad research community and general public through presentations at National/International conferences, refereed journal publications and demonstrations at science events.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Chemical pre-intercalation is a wet chemistry approach, in which the inorganic ions are inserted into the crystal structure of the electrode material in a solution followed by the formation of a gel and/or sol, or another form of a precipitate, with inorganic ions being 'trapped' in the structure of a solid material. The goal of this proposed research is to test the hypothesis that high capacity, long cycle life and high power can be achieved in Na-ion battery electrodes by introducing specific types and amounts of chemically pre-intercalated ions, which enables materials with high specific capacity, enhanced structural stability and fast ionic diffusion. Vanadium oxide, a material with rich crystal chemistry, structural flexibility and morphological architectures, is chosen as a host structure for chemical pre-intercalation. The project seeks a systematic understanding of synthesis - structure - performance relationships for chemically pre-intercalated vanadium oxide electrodes in Na-ion batteries. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic discharge/charge cycling, rate capability experiments and impedance spectroscopy measurements. The research team plans to determine how changes in the synthesis parameters affect electrochemical performance with the aim to understand fundamental phenomena related to materials chemistry and structure that may lead to larger amount of the stored charge, faster ion and electron transport, and excellent stability during reversible cycling of sodium ions."

As such, the research team argues that it is necessary to understand the origins, patterns, and amplitudes of climate variability at decadal to centennial (dec-cen) timescales. If dec-cen variations are weak, the team hypothesizes that climate change impacts on regional hydroclimate will likely unfold as a consequence of slow-varying changes in radiative forcing. If dec-cen variations are strong, however, then the team argues that the combined effects of atmospheric warming and natural variability on long timescales should be considered jointly in any understanding of climate.<br/><br/>The research team specifically seeks to quantify the amplitude of low-frequency hydroclimatic variability in models, proxies, and observations, while at the same time utilizing a new suite of last millennium numerical climate models produced by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. They will apply both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques to this ensemble, including one ultra-high (temporal) resolution control simulation run and use these results to drive forward models of tree-ring growth. <br/><br/>Further, the researchers will reprocess all tree-ring width and density measurements from the Northern Hemisphere archived by the International Tree-Ring Databank to optimize the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability.  Both of these products - the high-resolution tree-ring simulations from climate models and the new dec-cen optimized tree-ring network - will be evaluated using a robust null-hypothesis for the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability. These activities will, in turn, improve the understanding of the full magnitude dec-cen variability, its spatial footprint, and its relevance to future megadrought risk.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts involve organizing two workshops for paleoclimate researchers and statisticians to explore new methods of inference from this dataset. In addition, the comprehensive analysis of dec-cen patterns across the North American tree-ring network will address directly the ongoing debate about the origins of temporal autocorrelation in tree-ring records and the potential confounding effects of biological persistence on climate histories estimated from this proxy. Furthermore, this project will support two graduate students in the course of the research."

The investigator will develop a Cognitive Diagnostic Computerized Adaptive Testing (CD-CAT) system to support the learning of introductory statistics at the university level. The work represents a significant advance in educational testing to provide personalized assessments which in turn generate diagnostic information based on students' proficiency profiles, as opposed to an abstract overall test score. <br/><br/>The research deals specifically with difficulties such as the requirement of large samples, underdevelopment in identification of the underlying model, and possible technical complexity limiting the availability of the model-based CD-CAT to educational practitioners; especially teachers and their students in smaller instructional settings. In light of these considerations, the project first proposes an innovative general nonparametric classification (GNPC) alternative, which is a general version of the nonparametric classification (NPC) method. The GNPC method can be used to analyze not only large- but also small-scale data, such as course-based data, conforming to a broad range of cognitive diagnostic models, an advantage that makes cognitive diagnosis analysis accessible to those who are in its highest need. The development of this ready-to-use heuristic method then moves the field further toward the routine use of the nonparametric CD-CAT within educational micro-environments. The proposed algorithms will be applied to online statistics courses, where high-performance formative assessments are employed to provide useful and timely feedback on how well students perform. The proposed line of inquiry integrates research and education through the development of an online CD-CAT system to support the learning of statistics.

A new real-time mobile sensing system, which combines real-time mobile sensing and heterogeneous driving environments, is developed to address driving safety concerns. The final results will be the abiding principles of cyber-physical architecture that resolve dynamic impacts of complex environments and provide clear guidelines over Internet of Things (IoTs). Specifically, effective features are investigated from mobile sensor readings that are able to depict each type of abnormal driving behaviors. These features can thus be extracted to localize the vehicles and derive the patterns of abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., weaving, swerving, fast U-turn, and sudden breaks) with the consideration of generic driving scenarios and heterogeneous mobile devices. Techniques based on machine learning are developed to generate a classifier model that could clearly identify fine-grained abnormal driving behaviors. The classifier model will be further utilized as a foundation to devise the location-aware driving safety system, which can track users' driving behaviors and realize location-related dangerous vehicular status in real-time using low-computing-capability mobile devices."

The research will investigate how hyper-Khler manifolds degenerate, or break into simpler pieces. The investigator will first study how the known examples degenerate, to infer general patterns, and will then work to reverse the process to construct new examples. The work will make use of mirror symmetry, a remarkable correspondence between pairs of geometric spaces discovered by physicists. For hyper-Khler manifolds, mirror symmetry can be understood quite explicitly. This provides information about degenerations of hyper-Khler manifolds, for example, the combinatorial way in which the different pieces fit together.<br/><br/>This award supports research at the interface between algebraic geometry and differential geometry on hyper-Khler manifolds, which are important in geometry and theoretical physics. Only a few types of examples are known, and previous constructions have been based on classical algebraic geometry. The investigator will use new techniques coming from mirror symmetry, cluster algebras, and deformation theory to produce new examples, or alternatively, to discover tangible obstructions to their existence. In prior collaborative work, he developed a geometric interpretation of cluster algebras in terms of toric and birational geometry. These geometric spaces, called cluster varieties, are expected to form the building blocks of degenerations of hyper-Khler manifolds. In subsequent collaborative work, the investigator studied mirror symmetry for cluster varieties. This involves piecewise linear geometric structures that can be used to understand how to glue cluster varieties together to form a hyper-Khler manifold."

With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry, this research project focuses on the preparation of new types of zeolites, a class of microporous, crystalline materials consisting of silicon, aluminum and oxygen that both occur naturally and are synthesized industrially on a very large scale to satisfy the widespread demand for their use in catalysis applications. This project details the development of a new class of zeolites that contain iron instead of aluminum and silicon.  These iron-based zeolites can be utilized as catalysts for industry, as new magnetic materials for sustainable energy creation, and as new cathode materials for sodium batteries. To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting-edge techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of the art instrumentation.  The educational aspect of this research assures that highly trained men, women, and underrepresented minorities can enter the workforce and meet industry's need for scientists.<br/><br/>Using the first sodalite-type zeolite containing an all iron framework as a model, the hydroflux synthetic method developed in the zur Loye group is applied to the synthesis of new iron-based framework materials that can impact a large number of research areas ranging from simple catalytic materials, to new magnetic materials, to new sodium ion batteries for stationary power storage.  The synthetic objective is the compositional and structural expansion of the crystal chemistry of zeolites, specifically synthesis of ferrolites crystallizing in new framework structures via new synthetic routes.  The optimized reaction conditions target the formation of new iron based frameworks, specifically the zeolite A and zeolite Y type structures, that are then investigated for their magnetic behavior and for their ability to ion exchange sodium, a necessary requirement for stationary sodium battery applications.  The different frameworks are highly magnetic due to the presence of Fe-O-Fe linkages, which exert an important influence on the structure-specific magnetic behavior.  Similarly, the specific framework structure, with different sized channels, is expected to greatly impact the sodium ion mobility and, thus, that optimization is important for battery applications."

This research project studies Iwasawa theory, a branch of number theory. It relates integral and rational solutions of polynomial equations to certain analytic objects known as L-functions. The project exploits novel approaches to this study, which combine new tools from the Langlands program and algebraic geometry. The new approaches have been used to prove that a majority of elliptic curves satisfy the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, whose general truth is still a challenging open question in number theory.  This research project aims to expand the set of elliptic curves known to satisfy the conjecture.<br/><br/>More concretely, this project studies the relationships between special values of L-functions and certain arithmetic objects, namely the Selmer groups of Galois representations. For a prime number p the main problems under study are the Iwasawa main conjectures and p-adic Bloch-Kato conjectures. The project develops a new approach towards non-ordinary Iwasawa theory: first to study Greenberg type Iwasawa main conjectures that are accessible to proof due to their ordinary nature, and then to relate them to non-ordinary Iwasawa theory using explicit reciprocity laws of special cycles. The ultimate goal is to prove, for all GL(2) modular forms (of any weight and possibly with ramification at p): the p-part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula in the case when analytic rank is 1 or 0; the Iwasawa main conjecture; and that the vanishing of central critical L-value implies the corresponding Selmer group has rank at least 1. The project also aims to study these problems for higher rank motives, especially those associated to cusp forms on unitary groups."

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Texas at Austin and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Tom Juenger.<br/><br/>Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is the most consumed source of plant protein worldwide and is a particularly important source of protein in the developing world. A question of pressing importance is how important crop traits, such as protein or yield, were influenced by interaction of genes with the environment, so called GXE interactions. Common bean was domesticated to grow in a wide variety of environments and is thus an excellent candidate to explore how crop traits are determined by GXE interactions. An extensive dataset of over 500 common bean varieties grown at 36 locations across the United States over 34 years links bean traits in different environments. This research project leverages these historical datasets and will document genetic variation in common bean, thus providing an exciting opportunity to connect the traits to their genetic drivers. Undergraduate students will be trained in cutting edge genomic analysis and the public will learn about plant genomics through outreach activities with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.<br/><br/>This project combines experiments and computational analyses to determine the interactions of GXE on yield variation and other traits of common bean. New association mapping populations will be produced, and these will be directly connected to historically robust datasets containing phenotype and yield data for common bean. The genetics of yield variation will be determined through genome-wide association approaches, both for regions with genomic variation between varieties and genomic regions fixed by local adaptation between bean races. The project will test for differential expression and physiology between varieties with and without GxE in response to specific climate drivers."

The research extends Tinto's university departure model to include the career exploration process where a student leaves STEM but remains in college. The framework will be developed and tested by extensive measurement of demographic, social, academic, affective (self-efficacy, self-esteem, belonging), career exploration/aspirations and psychological variables at four longitudinal points in physics and mathematics introductory class sequences required for many STEM majors. The longitudinal measurement monitors evolution of a student's STEM career commitment and vocational identity, and determines factors that influence a decision to begin the process of STEM departure or lead to a well-investigated resolution to pursue a STEM career. The research will explore crucial questions influencing university STEM departure, including to what extent departure is preventable by modifying advising protocols, to what extent performance in these gate-keeper classes and its effect on self-efficacy influence the decision to change major, what psychological/social factors mark students beginning to explore non-STEM careers, and to what extent belonging influences retention, particularly of underrepresented women and rural students.  The research will contribute to a deeper understanding of this important phenomenon. It also will inform the national discussion of STEM retention by producing a theoretical framework of STEM departure validated across a large, economically diverse pool of students. <br/><br/>The research design will implement a multi-stage analysis and measurement with the goal of modeling the process of STEM departure and quantifying the reasons for and markers of the departure process. Researchers will investigate in depth: (1) what modifications are needed in theoretical frameworks for college departure to explain intra-university departure from STEM disciplines, (2) the minimum information required to predict STEM departure and where STEM departure originates, (3) what fraction of STEM departure could be prevented by interventions, (4) how STEM departure markers differ for underserved populations, and (5) how to identify subpopulations of students where interventions will be most effective. Researchers will use institutional class-taking and outcome data to build a set of ""survival"" probabilities for individual classes and class-taking sequences. Linear regression analysis then be used to analyze how these probabilities are affected by (1) the student's intrinsic characteristics (ability measured by ACT/SAT, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, first generation status, and personality profile), (2) the student's academic preparation (high school GPA and high school course-taking patterns), (3) the student's academic performance in his or her current class (measured by attendance patterns and assignment grades), (4) the students current social connectedness to both family and university structures and communities, and (5) the student's current affective state, his or her self-efficacy, sense of belonging, self-esteem, and STEM identity. Latent growth modeling will track changes in these factors over time. In parallel, the student's vocational identity status, his or her state of career exploration and career decision making, will be monitored. Using the four-point longitudinal measurement, transitions in the student's vocational identity state (particularly changes that indicate a renewed career exportation process and therefore the threat of STEM departure) will be correlated with previous changes in survival probabilities and with changes in the student's affective, academic, or social state. Signatures to inform advisers of at risk students and general changes to advising protocols will be developed. Campus social/academic structures that promote retention will be identified. At all levels, differential results for underrepresented students will be investigated with the goal of designing interventions that target these populations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and workforce development."

As the climate warms, changes to this carbon pool become increasingly important to understand. Carbon release from soils would increase concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, while increases in soil carbon pools would remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Higher temperatures have already trigged widespread expansion of large, woody shrubs across arctic tundra, and appear to stimulate the loss of soil carbon.  This research examines whether shrubs change the composition of microbial communities in a way that positively impacts the shrub growth. This information is critical to understanding how shrubs affect carbon pools of plants and soils in the arctic. Using arctic soils from Alaska, the investigators will establish a plant growth experiment to determine how shrubs respond to different treatments of soil microbes and nutrients. By investigating plants, soils, and microbes in one experiment, this work will improve the accuracy of models of arctic carbon dynamics. In addition, this work will train undergraduates in both field and laboratory research skills and provide hands-on scientific experience. The results of this research will also be integrated into lesson plans for elementary, middle, and high school students through a collaboration between the researchers and local Georgia teachers. <br/><br/>Previous research by these investigators demonstrates that shrubs promote a more active and less nutrient limited microbial community, which may lead to carbon loss from shrub soils. These findings suggest that shrubs stimulate soil microbial activity as a mechanism to improve nutrient availability, but it is unclear if shrub-induced changes to microbial communities benefit shrub growth.  Using arctic soils, the researchers will establish a plant growth experiment using a fully factorial design crossing soil microbial source (shrub vs non-shrub) by nitrogen (+/-) and phosphorus (+/-) with a sterile control for three species of shrubs (Alnus fruticosa, Betula nana, and Salix pulchra). Collected data will include plant biomass, quantification of root symbioses, and soil microbial biomass. These data will be used to understand the magnitude and direction of shrub-microbial relationships and if carbon loss induced by microbial activity can be counterbalance by shrub carbon gain."

So while English is often thought of as having subjects and objects that work with verbs to create sentences, linguists have shown a much larger range of ways that subjects behave, especially in terms of their relationships to the verb and the roles they play in sentences.  For example, some subjects are the agent of the action, such as ""She saw the cat,"" others are patients of the action, as in ""The ball was thrown by the boy,"" and some subjects are empty placeholders, such as the ""it"" in ""It is important that you study math.""  Languages show a wide variety of approaches for how these subject roles and object roles pattern, and some of these patterns are quite rare.  Documenting and analyzing these kinds of patterns, which linguists call ""alignment"", is important for a larger understanding of the cross-linguistic variation in human grammar.  This dissertation will add deeper insight to the less frequent type of patterns (""typology"").<br/><br/>In this dissertation project, doctoral student Adam Roth Singerman will document the grammar of Tupari, an endangered language spoken by perhaps 300 people in villages in the Rio Branco Indigenous Reserve, in the Brazilian state of Rondnia.  Working closely with the community, Singerman will first document a wide variety of interesting grammatical phenomena in Tupari. This theory-neutral description of the language's morphosyntax will serve as the basis for the first complete reference grammar of the language. It will also create a foundation for more detailed, theoretical investigation into several key topics, focusing especially on the grammatical alignment patterns (both ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative) which Tupari shows.  Alignment in Tupari behaves in ways that defy previous generalizations from the literature, so studying it in greater depth is important for typological research and for syntactic theory.  In addition to creating a comprehensive, complete description of Tupari grammar, Singerman will also collaborate with the community to develop native literacy materials. The dissertation will also facilitate comparative analysis of the Tupian family, drawing from languages of Rondnia that are historically related to Tupari, including Gavio, Mekens, and Karitina."

This project focuses on a critical challenge in STEM education: preparing novice secondary school teachers to provide effective science and mathematics instruction to the increasingly culturally and linguistically diverse secondary school population who have traditionally been underserved in STEM education and are underrepresented in STEM degrees and careers.  The study will analyze the impact of the University of California Undergraduate CalTeach program, which provides undergraduate STEM majors with STEM education coursework and field practicum, on the development of novice teachers' knowledge, beliefs and practice as they progress through their program of pre-service teacher preparation into the first year of teaching.  This will be done through a comparative study of CalTeach students to non-CalTeach students in the same teacher preparation programs. The study will also track the participants through the first year of teaching to analyze school placement, retention and teaching efficacy of the two groups.  The research will include an emphasis on the preparation of teachers to implement the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core State Standards (CSSS-Mathematics) and the related challenge of integrating the teaching of academic language and literacy into the teaching of STEM subjects for English Learners (EL). <br/><br/>The SMTRI research study will conduct three analyses to investigate: (1) the impact of undergraduate STEM Education on STEM graduates' decision to become teachers -- who they are and what they do after graduation; (2) the development of CalTeach program graduates' knowledge, beliefs and practice for teaching mathematics and science in comparison with the development of non-CalTeach graduates as they progress through teacher preparation into their first year of teaching; and (3) the impact of the form of the teacher preparation program by comparing novice teacher development in an undergraduate teacher education program at UCB with the development of novice teachers in traditional graduate programs of teacher education at UCD, UCSB, UCSC and UCSD. The STEM focus for this proposal is secondary STEM teacher education (certification areas: biology, chemistry, mathematics and biology).  The SMTRI project also will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by improving the knowledge base on preparing all teachers to work with culturally and linguistically diverse student populations. The project will develop a research and development partnership among five university teacher education programs (UCB, UCD, UCSB, UCSC, UCSD) with the possibility of scaling up to similar teacher education programs nationally.  Ultimately, SMTRI has the potential to make a significant contribution to research on STEM education, teacher education, and EL learning as it examines STEM teacher preparation and the integration of science, language and literacy teaching in the NGSS and CCSS. The findings of this study have the potential for wide scale impact in an area of professional education where many teacher education programs are weak in preparing student teachers to implement standards-based science and mathematics teaching in culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms."

The primary goal of the project is to meet emerging needs for increased energy efficiency by improving the quality of technician education in Industrial Electronics and Diesel and Heavy Equipment Mechanics. Faculty will actively recruit diverse student groups including veterans and other non-traditional groups to programs through career fairs, campus visits, and visits to military installations.  The program responds to industry demands as graduates of the Industrial Electronics program will have experience with Siemens Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are widely used in industry for their efficiency and scalability. Graduates of the Diesel and Mechanics program with preparation on natural gas engines will serve employers not only on offshore rigs, but also in the transportation industry with fleet vehicles and local and regional carriers. Diesel technicians who have experience with these engines are integral to the continued growth and evolution of the natural gas industry. By better preparing program graduates and providing instructional resources for classroom integration, the college will advance technician education in the diesel and electronics fields.<br/><br/>The college plans to meet its project goals through professional development for faculty, to include instruction in natural-gas engines and Siemens components, and through respective curriculum revisions that will ensure graduates are more fully prepared for the workforce. Students enrolled in the Industrial Electronics and Diesel and Heavy Equipment Mechanics programs will receive an enhanced curriculum taught by instructors who have participated in extensive professional development in their fields. The inclusion in the curriculum of instruction on natural gas engines will assure that the enhanced programs meet the needs of employers as these additions respond directly to industry demands. Technicians with this additional knowledge will be more flexible and better able to respond to the developments in their field. During the professional development phase of the project, faculty will participate in rigorous industry training and gain the knowledge and expertise needed to master emerging trends, expand their technical programs, and meet workforce demands. During the curriculum revision phase, faculty will collaborate with one another, the Dean of Applied Technologies, their technical advisory committees, and state-wide curriculum development committees to ensure the creation of well-developed course objectives, activities, and student learning outcomes. The programs will include additional mathematics and science courses, and more mathematics and science will be integrated into the technical courses.  Extensive assessment of student learning will ensure that students are graduating with the knowledge and skills required to be successful in their field. Articulation agreements are in place with two universities for students who wish to continue their educations."

Arithmetic geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies integer solutions of polynomial equations and has played a central role in solving many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell conjecture concerning the number of rational points on a curve. The main objects of study in this research project are Shimura varieties, which are higher dimensional analogues of modular curves that parametrize families of Riemann surfaces. The study of Shimura varieties is at the interface of algebraic geometry, number theory, and representation theory and has broad applications to a number of far-reaching and influential conjectures.<br/><br/>One of the main topics of this research project concerns the arithmetic of Shimura varieties. One part of the work aims to relate the Hasse-Weil zeta function of a certain class of Shimura varieties -- those of Hodge type -- to automorphic L-functions, establishing a conjecture of Langlands. Another aims to study the structure of special points on these varieties and to show that, in certain situations, every mod p isogeny class contains the reduction of a special point. Other directions in the project include the Grothendieck-Katz p-curvature conjecture, as well Diophantine methods for constructing algebraic cycles."

As such, the research team argues that it is necessary to understand the origins, patterns, and amplitudes of climate variability at decadal to centennial (dec-cen) timescales. If dec-cen variations are weak, the team hypothesizes that climate change impacts on regional hydroclimate will likely unfold as a consequence of slow-varying changes in radiative forcing. If dec-cen variations are strong, however, then the team argues that the combined effects of atmospheric warming and natural variability on long timescales should be considered jointly in any understanding of climate.<br/><br/>The research team specifically seeks to quantify the amplitude of low-frequency hydroclimatic variability in models, proxies, and observations, while at the same time utilizing a new suite of last millennium numerical climate models produced by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. They will apply both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques to this ensemble, including one ultra-high (temporal) resolution control simulation run and use these results to drive forward models of tree-ring growth. <br/><br/>Further, the researchers will reprocess all tree-ring width and density measurements from the Northern Hemisphere archived by the International Tree-Ring Databank to optimize the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability.  Both of these products - the high-resolution tree-ring simulations from climate models and the new dec-cen optimized tree-ring network - will be evaluated using a robust null-hypothesis for the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability. These activities will, in turn, improve the understanding of the full magnitude dec-cen variability, its spatial footprint, and its relevance to future megadrought risk.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts involve organizing two workshops for paleoclimate researchers and statisticians to explore new methods of inference from this dataset. In addition, the comprehensive analysis of dec-cen patterns across the North American tree-ring network will address directly the ongoing debate about the origins of temporal autocorrelation in tree-ring records and the potential confounding effects of biological persistence on climate histories estimated from this proxy. Furthermore, this project will support two graduate students in the course of the research."

The project aims to prepare and characterize a so far unknown class of dielectric materials based on artificial dipolar molecular rotors arranged in a 2-dimensional grid.  Such materials do not occur in nature and would be useful for signal processing and specifically for minituarization of analog components in electronic circuitry such as that found in cellular telephones.

The specifically synthesized rod-like rotor molecules carry a dipolar rotator between two triptycene units on an axle normal to the surface, and a carboxylic group at one end (the term molecular rotor is used for a molecule with a rotatable part, which is called the rotator).  Initial grazing-incidence X-ray scattering and other data demonstrate that molecules of this type self-assemble into a Langmuir monolayer on an aqueous subphase.  The structure of the assembly is characterized by an interlocking of the triptycene units into a double-decker trigonal pattern, with almost freely rotatable dipoles between the decks.  The distance between the dipoles and their magnitude are such that as long as sufficiently large 2-dimensional single-crystal domains can be prepared, in the first approximation the ground state should be ferroelectric, with a Curie temperature above ambient.  Rotator dynamics in the transferred monolayers (and multilayers) are to be studied by electric dichroism in the infrared part of the spectrum in the Michl laboratory and by dielectric spectroscopy in the Rogers laboratory.  Theory predicts the existence of ferroelectric ordering with unusually low velocity polar sound waves when long-range dipolar interactions dominate local steric barriers to rotation."

These applications also depend on a rigorous means of assessing tree inference uncertainty; the Bayesian framework provides a principled means of assessing and integrating out this uncertainty. The currently available Bayesian algorithmic tools are not capable of performing inferences on large modern data sets, which also may be continually changing as new sequencing results become available. In particular, state-of-the-art methods are almost exclusively based on random-walk Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using uniformly selected local moves, even though most of these local moves will substantially worsen even a mediocre tree. Convergence problems with this approach are well documented, and thus current methods are limited to around 1000 sequences, a number much smaller than the size of microbial and immune data sets relevant to modern biomedicine. In addition, all current methods require inference to be started from scratch each time the sequence data changes. The broader impacts of this work will extend in three directions: enabling novel applications of Bayesian phylogenetics, stimulating new areas of computer science research, and attracting new talent to the field.<br/><br/>Applications of phylogenetics, in particular Bayesian phylogenetics, are being significantly held back by computational limitations.  High-throughput sequencing technologies can return millions of sequences for studies of the human microbiome, viruses, oceanic microbes and antibody-making B Cells but theses cannot be handled with current methods.  The models also need to be more realistic, without assumptions of independent interactions.  Understanding the shape of multidimensional phylogenetic likelihood surfaces in detail might help to improve the topology.  The teams will also investigate when an optimal tree on a taxon sets contains the optimal tree on a taxon subset.  These will help to expand the approach to phylogenetic inference. These algorithmic insights will be incorporated into publicly available inference packages with a goal to provide inference on an order of magnitude more taxa than currently possible."

All work on the cellular mechanisms of chromatophore control in squid has focused on three related species that inhabit relatively shallow coastal areas that have prominent features like seaweed, rocks and coral on the ocean floor. Skin-color changes in these species are associated with camouflage, signaling between individuals of the same species and threat displays with other species. The deeper open ocean presents a radically different environment that is also inhabited by many squids, primarily of different taxonomic families from the one commonly inhabiting coastal waters. An important open-ocean family includes the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas). There is little light in the ocean at depths inhabited by these squid during daytime, and visual features such as coral and rocks are non-existent. Novel color-change behaviors in Dosidicus include repetitive whole-body ""flashing,"" used for signaling between individuals of this species, and chaotic ""flickering"" that may underlie camouflage in the open ocean. Although these dynamic behaviors contrast with the more static patterns typical of coastal species, squids of both families employ temporal and spatial patterning to varying degrees. It is therefore likely that basic mechanisms for controlling the chromatophore network are the same in most, if not all, squids. ""Vertical"" control from the brain to the chromatophore muscles is known in the coastal squids, and may account for most chromatophore-based behaviors in those species, but behaviors like flickering in deeper-water species may be more influenced by processes within the skin itself that permit changes in chromatophores to spread from one to another without directly involving the nervous system. This hypothetical pathway would define a ""horizontal"" or distributed control system in the periphery that would permit autonomous behavior within the chromatophore network. This issue is the primary significance of the project. Understanding the fundamentals of horizontal control of chromatophores has the potential of being transformative to the field, because the current paradigm is that all control is directly exerted by the brain. Horizontal control is relevant to blood delivery to local tissues by circulatory systems, gut function and nervous system micro-circuits in vertebrates. Therefore, results from this project would also influence understanding of local control more broadly. From a wider perspective, results of this project will provide insight into the interactions of distributed (horizontal) and top-down (vertical) control mechanisms, a subject relevant to the general ability of complex systems to generate non-predictable, emergent phenomena. This concept is of fundamental interest to a broad sector of society, ranging from engineering to economics to politics.<br/><br/>An integrated approach will permit testing the hypothesis that control of the chromatophore network in squid involves peripheral mechanisms that are distinct from the neuronal motor-control pathway that descends from the brain. Spontaneous chromatophore activity that is independent of canonical neural control will be isolated by experimental manipulations in coastal loliginid squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), including chronic denervation and pharmacological block of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. In addition, a comparative approach will take advantage of an oceanic ommastrephid species, Dosidicus gigas, in which spontaneous, tetrodotoxin-resistant chromatophore activity is extremely prominent. Relevant methods involve molecular transcriptomics, cellular electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy. Specific aims are: 1) identify molecular and physiological properties of relevant ion channels and receptors that control excitability in the radial muscle fibers that operate individual chromatophore organs; 2) define structural, molecular and physiological features of coupling mechanisms between muscle fibers of neighboring chromatophores that define an excitatory transmission pathway within the skin; 3) elucidate the inhibitory role in controlling spontaneous chromatophore activity played by serotonin; 4) carry out parallel experiments in Dosidicus, a member of a family of ecologically important squid in which cellular studies of chromatophores have never been carried out. This project will support undergraduate and graduate student training, and includes significant efforts to involve students from groups underrepresented in STEM."

In addition to the preparation of large number of substrates with catalyst coatings, linker systems and surface loadings, these modified implant materials will be tested against different cell cultures/media to establish the ability of these immobilized catalysts to reduce reactive oxygen before and after exposure to cells for up to two weeks. The second aim of this award is: a) to study damage to implant materials under simulated FBR conditions in vitro; and b) to visualize and quantify the production of ROS and inflammatory cytokines of macrophages reacting to catalytically active substrates.

Partial conversion of nanowires into a layered structure forces the integration of crystallographically and topologically dissimilar materials, which presents a compatibility challenge that the system needs to overcome by finding the energetically preferred or kinetically most accessible hybrid configuration. Novel membrane reactor cells - miniature analogues of tube furnaces that are widely used for materials synthesis and processing in research and in industry - are developed as platforms for in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiments at the single nanowire level that provide unprecedented insight into the atomistic reaction pathways, mass transport, and phase nucleation and growth kinetics of the targeted solid-state transformations. The primary model systems are chalcogen (S, Se, Te) induced reactions of homogeneous Ge, Si1-xGex alloy, and axially segmented Ge-AuGe nanowires and their transformations into layered Ge-chalcogenides. Generalization of the approach is used to study other hybrid systems, such as those integrating GaAs or GaN nanowires with GaS/Se layered crystals. The structure and morphology of the obtained hybrid materials is correlated with their optoelectronic properties via cathodoluminescence at resolution below the exciton radius, complemented by charge transport and electrochemical measurements, to determine the role of interfaces and defects on bandgaps, exciton binding, as well as carrier, charge and energy transfer between the different components of the hybrids. Overall, the research effort is expected to advance the fundamental understanding of the integration of dissimilar materials into hybrid nanostructures via solid-state reactions, and of the emerging optical and electronic functionalities of these complex systems."

Currently, the details of protein interactions under elevated physical stress are largely missing, therefore, preventing fundamental, molecular understanding of mechano-transduction. This research is based on an innovative biochemical strategy to identify force-induced protein interactions surrounding zyxin, a unique force-sensing protein. Using promiscuous biotin ligase to label proximal proteins and cell stretch device to exaggerate forces exerted to cell junctions, the research team will determine how the composition of proteins surrounding zyxin changes with the application of substrate stretch, then test the roles of these proteins during the force-generating events. Furthermore, the precise force-dependent protein-protein interactions will be analyzed using mutational approaches."

There is growing consensus that at least part of the problem is public distrust in the warnings themselves. This project investigates three psychological issues related to public distrust in weather warnings. The first has to do with inconsistency. Forecasts for high-impact weather events are often made days in advance to allow residents time to prepare. Subsequent forecasts for the same event may differ from earlier forecasts, giving the impression of inconsistency. Forecasters tend to assume that people distrust inconsistent forecasts and are reluctant to change forecasts even when better information becomes available, preferring to sacrifice accuracy for consistency. This project tests whether inconsistency or inaccuracy is more injurious to trust. Distrust may also arise from the fact that severe weather events are usually presented as certain because forecasters worry that admitting uncertainty signals incompetence. Most people, however, understand that weather prediction involves some level of uncertainty. Therefore too much certainty may seem implausible. This project tests whether adding an uncertainty estimate (e.g. the probability of a tornedo at your location) increases or decreases trust and compliance with warnings. Finally, distrust in warning forecasts may lead to delaying precautionary action in order to gather more information. If people wait too long, they may not have enough time to adequately protect themselves before severe weather hits. This project will determine the appropriate information to include in weather warnings to inspire trust and allow people to make timely decisions. Thus, the results of this project will influence forecast communication practices to provide people with better and more trustworthy information upon which to base critical weather related decisions, ultimately saving lives. The value of accurate weather warnings with generous lead times will be realized only if the public trusts them and acts accordingly. This research will inform ""best practices"" in warning communication procedures to promote both trust in the forecast and timely responses. As such, results of this work may well improve compliance with warnings and save lives.<br/><br/>The research team investigates these issues in experimental studies, using realistic weather-related decision tasks. Establishing the hypothesized effects on trust and decisions in a controlled laboratory environment will permit testing forecast communication methods to address them. Of particular interest is the inclusion of specific uncertainty estimates. Conveying the notion that the forecast was intended as probabilistic may reduce effects of both inconsistency and inaccuracy. Uncertainty estimates may also attenuate delay beyond optimal stopping by satisfying the need for additional information. Likelihood communication, however, may need to be simplified in dynamic, time pressured situations so color coded risk scales will also be tested. Thus, these experiments will compare identical situations in which people receive either probabilistic forecasts, color-codes or conventional warnings, to determine which method leads to greater trust and better decisions. In sum, the goal is to carve out answers to a set of specific but critical questions, using careful experimental procedures that make direct comparisons between one situation and another and one form of communication and another, holding all other factors constant to yield firm conclusions about their effects. It is a cognitive-experimental approach to what has heretofore been a problem tackled primarily with other social science tools. This work will benefit the scientific community at large by providing a unique theoretical understanding of the cognitive processes involved in interpreting, trusting and acting on complex and dynamic predictions, with implications in diverse domains."

The main goals of this research project are to use tools from linear algebra and geometry to better understand and exploit natural symmetries enjoyed by symplectic varieties known as symplectic resolutions. The work is expected to strengthen connections of the field with geometric representation theory, combinatorics, and string theory.<br/><br/>In more detail, this research project consists of four interrelated subprojects. The first subproject is to study symplectic duality between pairs of symplectic resolutions. This duality is closely related to mirror duality for 3-dimensional gauge theories. The second subproject is to prove a conjecture relating the intersection cohomology of a symplectic cone to the quantum cohomology of its symplectic resolution. The third subproject is to classify hypertoric varieties using zonotopal tilings, much in the same way that toric varieties are classified by fans.

Robinson, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at The University of Georgia.  Professor Robinson and his research team are studying the unique chemistry of low-oxidation state main group chemical compounds. The goal of this research is to exploit the unique stabilizing effects of organic bases (a class of compounds known as carbenes) on highly reactive main group molecules. For example, important molecules like disilicon (Si2) are only detectable at extremely low temperatures. In contrast, diphosphorus (P2) is typically only detectable at very high temperatures. The Robinson team has developed a means to stabilize molecules like Si2 and P2 (and many others) at room temperature, thus allowing the convenient study of the structure and reactivity of these important molecules. In particular, these researchers recently reported the first stable molecular examples of silicon oxides. This project investigates the synthesis of more ambitious silicon oxides. This chemistry has the potential for us to learn more about the silicon-oxygen interface with possible implications to computer chips and semiconductors. These researchers will also attempt to synthesize molecules containing large silicon and arsenic clusters. This project lies at the heart of main group chemistry, a field of inorganic chemistry that has traditionally received more emphasis in Europe. Outreach activities involving women and traditionally under-represented groups is central to this research. The students engaged in this work are acquiring valuable synthetic and experimental skills that make them highly valuable in the employment market.<br/><br/>An ambitious program to explore challenging areas of low-oxidation main group chemistry is underway. The Robinson laboratory has developed N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC or L:) and N-heterocyclic dicarbene (NHDC) derivatives that are being used as a unique platform from which many unusual low-oxidation state main group species can be synthetically stabilized. Major synthetic goals in this work include: (a) carbene-based multisilylenes; (b) carbene-stabilized silicon atom and clusters; (c) carbene-stabilized heteronuclear diatomic molecules [i.e., silicon carbides, diatomic III-V (13-15) species, arsenic phosphide (AsP)]. The recent report by this laboratory of carbene-stabilization of elusive silicon oxides (Nature Chem. 2015, 7, 509) has encouraged these workers to develop the long-sought molecular chemistry of SOx. Consequently, the syntheses of a series of carbene-stabilized silicon oxides (such as SiO, SiO2, Si2O, Si2O2, and Si3O6, etc.) and silicon hydrides [Si3H2 and Si2H2 (parent disilyne)] are being pursued. These carbene-stabilized silicon oxides may be further utilized to develop the corresponding transition-metal-modified derivatives and transfer silicon oxide clusters into organic or organometallic substrates. In addition, carbene-stabilized bis-silylenes are explored as potential transfer agents for the disilyne unit. The transition metal chemistry of carbene-stabilized zero-oxidation-state main group species are being examined in the work. Research findings from the Robinson laboratory have repeatedly challenged traditional theories of structure and bonding in inorganic chemistry and some of this has begun to appear in chemistry textbooks. Students engaged in this work are acquiring valuable synthetic, crystallographic, and computational skills. The Robinson laboratory has a positive record of extending the chemistry enterprise to larger segments of the human resource as a number of women and African Americans have been trained in his laboratory. In addition, Professor Robinson has developed a popular seminar course entitled ""Molecules That Changed History""."

Some physical systems are subject to external influences that vary over time; for example, the atmosphere is affected by the seasonal ocean temperatures, and the state of an electrical grid is affected by the time-varying demand for power. Physical systems are often also subject to random effects, either through measurement reading errors or noise in the system itself. This research project aims to develop a good statistical understanding of non-equilibrium and random complex systems using recent advances in probability and analysis. A better understanding of the statistical properties of non-equilibrium systems and random systems will lead to improved predictions and expand our knowledge of the statistical laws that can be expected to hold in nature. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop new techniques based on recent developments in martingale theory and analysis to investigate central limit theorems, almost sure invariance principles (a strong form of approximation by Brownian motion), large deviations, and other advanced statistics for a wide class of non-equilibrium and random dynamical systems that are used to model complex physical systems. Examples of the systems to be studied include billiard systems (polynomially and exponentially mixing), models of intermittency, Lorenz-like maps and flows, and systems arising from statistical mechanics. Statistical properties of random dynamics can be investigated by sampling over all noise realizations (annealed statistics) or along individual realizations of the noise (quenched statistics). The project will also develop our understanding of annealed and quenched statistical properties and the interplay between the two."

It will provide education and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Improved understanding of the surface layer turbulence and the ABL in general will be of importance to developing predictive models for atmospheric dispersion and diffusion, weather forecasting, atmospheric chemistry, wind energy, and land-atmosphere exchange. The modeling approach will also be important for modeling boundary layers with a strong pressure gradient (e.g., curved boundary layers) in the atmosphere and in engineering flows. Advances in these areas will benefit the environment and society."

For example, various geological records suggest that the Andes Mountains started to shorten significantly since at least 40 million years ago. However, paleo-altimetry proxy data reveal that most of the surface elevation of the Andes remained relatively low until as late as 20 or 15 million years ago, a time frame that is inconsistent with the shortening history. Furthermore, the early Cenozoic arc volcanism along the central Andes suddenly shifted more than 500 km inland around 30 million years ago and formed widespread silicic volcanic activity that continues to the present. Consequently, a clear relationship among these tectonic events is lacking. An important reason is that both the mantle structures beneath South America and their dynamic evolution remain poorly understood. In this proposal, the team plans to carry out a multidisciplinary research project to attempt to improve our knowledge about the observational records of surface tectonics, deep mantle seismic properties, and their geodynamic relationship with the temporal evolution of subduction beneath the continent. By collecting more data related to the tectonic history of South America and to the present-day mantle interior, they will build a sophisticated 4-dimentional geodynamic model using data assimilation, in order to quantitatively reproduce the past subduction history. Ultimately, the team hopes to better understand the Cenozoic evolution of the South American continent.  The team plans to achieve this goal through a collaborative research effort that involves seismology (led by PI Beck), geology (led by PI DeCelles), and geodynamics (led by PI Liu). They propose to reproduce the Cenozoic subduction history beneath South America and associated continental deformation using geodynamic models constrained by geophysical and geological observations. This project includes interdisciplinary training of several graduate students at two institutions, and also involves undergraduates at both institutions who will be involved in the research and will all students will participate in a summer field trip to western U.S. Cordillera as an analog for the South American Cordillera.   This multi-disciplinary combination will provide a unique opportunity for the students to understand orogenic systems at plate scale.<br/><br/>Multiple fundamental questions exist about the Cenozoic tectonic history of South America, including the asynchronous crustal shortening and surface uplift/subsidence history of the Andes, and the enigmatic Central Andean flare-up magmatism occurring during the late Cenozoic. None of the earlier proposed geodynamic models for the Cenozoic evolution of South America could simultaneously explain all these tectonic records and it is unclear whether these different physical processes could co-exist and interact in reality. An important reason for the existence of these alternative models is the uncertain subduction and mantle dynamics due to our imperfect knowledge of deep mantle structures beneath South America. Key observational constraints on the geodynamic and tectonic evolution include an improved present-day mantle seismic structure, especially in the lower mantle, a better identified relationship among structural deformation, surface uplift and magmatic history within western South America, and time-dependent geodynamic models that are consistent with these observational records."

It is often very hard for learners to perceive and produce the sounds in the new language when they are different from the sounds in the native language. Most adult learners will never speak like a native, instead retaining a non-native accent. New evidence suggests that sleep may have a special role to play in solidifying learning of non-native sounds. Moreover, the timing of learning with respect to sleep may be a crucial factor. This project assesses the relationship between sleep and non-native speech sound learning 1) through analysis of a large database from an industry partner specializing in language learning software and 2) by imaging and analyzing the neural systems that underlie successful learning.  A greater understanding of the optimal conditions for learning that integrates knowledge from perception, sleep, and neural processing will suggest strategies for language instruction that best help learners acquire the sounds of a new language. The research program showcases an academic/industry partnership and sharing of online tools that will be developed for perceptual testing.  In addition, outreach to middle-school students will help introduce these questions and experimental methods into STEM education.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to build a model of non-native speech sound learning, the Sleep Consolidation Model for Speech (SCMS), that integrates research from literatures on sleep, perception, and neurobiology to discover facilitating and constraining conditions on speech sound acquisition. Three linked projects test the idea that consolidation during sleep serves to protect learned speech sound information from interference and also allows learners to generalize learning to new speech sound categories. Project 1 tests predictions of the SCMS using web-based training and sleep monitoring in a standard laboratory (college student) sample. Project 2 involves the analysis of a large database from users of the Rosetta Stone language learning software, enabling the research team to extend these predictions to a more diverse and ecologically valid subject sample and new target languages (e.g. Irish, Arabic). Project 3 evaluates the neural predictions of the SCMS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the relationship between brain structure and learning, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to search for the neural locus of interference effects.  The results should help maximize conditions for learning, for example, by scheduling training in relation to sleep or by minimizing interfering stimuli and tasks between training and sleep. Results may also inform neural models of speech and learning, by elucidating the role of white matter connectivity in non-native speech learning. Although questions are couched in terms of a specific perceptual problem, learning a new language, the research also has implications for perceptual learning in other domains (e.g. novel visual category acquisition)."

Many proteins are capable of spontaneously folding from an extended chain into compact, functional machines. Once folded, proteins continue to undergo motions that are related to their stability  and function. Understanding the functional relevance of these motions remains extremely challenging because it is difficult to observe movement on the atomic scale and provide the necessary structural detail to connect these motions with a protein's function. The objectives of this project are 1) to develop powerful algorithms for simulating these protein motions, 2) apply these algorithms to understand how proteins fold, and 3) to combine these algorithms with biochemical experiments to design proteins that are more stable than their natural counterparts. Completion of this research will lay the foundation for future efforts to understand the role of protein motions in processes like cellular communications and to design proteins for applications such as the synthesis of biofuels. In concert with these research objectives, the PI will develop a python programming boot camp to teach students in biology the basic programming skills required to analyze their own data, providing a starting point for more sophisticated integration of computation and experiments and opening new job opportunities in the STEM fields. <br/><br/>This project will identify general properties of  free energy landscapes of proteins from simulation datasets created with specialized hardware and leverage them to empower similar studies with commodity hardware. This work will be guided by the hypothesis that leveraging ideas from optimization theory regarding exploration/exploitation tradeoffs will allow efficient conformational searches. Based on preliminary analyses, the PI's lab has already begun to prototype a new algorithm, referred to as fluctuation amplification of specific traits, or FAST. Further developing this algorithm, demonstrating its power, and disseminating it to the broader scientific community will lay a foundation for understanding and designing protein's conformational ensembles. Specific goals include: 1) develop the fluctuation amplification of specific traits (FAST) algorithm to efficiently explore a protein's conformational space, 2) test whether FAST can fold proteins, and 3) test whether FAST can reveal opportunities for designing stabilized proteins without perturbing their functions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Often, these parental effects prepare offspring for the parental environment. For instance, parents exposed to predators can produce offspring that are better able to survive the same predators. Offspring reproduction may also be influenced by parental experiences, but this remains an untested and important question. Parental effects are one way that organisms can respond quickly to rapid environmental change. Yet, parental effects could be bad for offspring if parent and offspring environments do not match. This project tests whether stress experienced by parents influences the mate choices made by their offspring much later, measures the costs and benefits of these effects in a changing environment, and identifies the underlying genomic mechanisms. This project will also lead to the publication of a new, active-learning case study based on this research, and use it to bring modern evolutionary research to middle school classrooms.<br/><br/>The proposed work capitalizes on an emerging model system, threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), in which both parents make substantial, distinct contributions to offspring development and females have quantifiable preferences for male traits. This proposal will reveal the relative importance of maternal, paternal, and parental experience on offspring reproductive phenotypes (Aim 1), whether transgenerational plasticity is adaptive or maladaptive when parental and offspring environments do or do not match (Aim 2), and if epigenetic states underlie changes in offspring mate choice behavior (Aim 3). No parents, mothers, fathers, or both parents will be exposed to predation and the mating decisions of their offspring tested under conditions in which parent and offspring environments do or do not match. Preliminary analyses show that paternal predator-exposure tends to shift daughters' mate preferences, while maternal predator-exposure alters daughters' interest in mating. If parental effects modify mate choice, they may facilitate rapid responses to environmental change, but whether these effects are adaptive depends on agreement between parent and offspring environments. Finally, parental effects on mate choice may be underlain by genome-wide variation in epigenetic states, specifically DNA methylation. Aim 3 uses new techniques to compare genome-wide methylation patterns of offspring from families in which no parents, mothers, fathers, or both parents were exposed to predation. This proposal will establish the role of parental effects on reproductive phenotypes for individual fitness and population dynamics in anthropogenically altered environments."

Professor Power and his group are developing new classes of compounds to demonstrate the interaction of the groups (ligands) within a metal complex.  The new compounds differ from those currently known because they are designed to display enhanced attractive London Dispersion Forces(LDFs) between molecules.  London Dispersion Forces strengthen the bonding and hence the stability of their extended structures. The London Dispersion Forces describe interactions between molecules rather than interactions between two atoms (covalent bonds).  To date, such forces have not generally been incorporated into molecular design. The project is aimed at obtaining a fundamental understanding of how such forces can be manipulated and exploited in chemical synthesis. The project lies at the interface of inorganic, organic, and organometallic chemistry. A variety of spectroscopic, structural, and computational techniques are used to characterize the new compounds obtained. Besides training in synthesis, the project exposes students to a variety of physico-chemical and theoretical methods. The research project also includes outreach activities designed to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in scientific research.<br/><br/>The basic scientific objective of the research is to design enhanced London Dispersion Forces into molecules so that their effects can be calculated, measured, and used to synthesize previously-unknown classes of molecules. The Power group plans to focus investigations on alkyl boranes with rigid hydrocarbon substituents derived from inexpensive natural products. They have already shown that the extended structures display Lewis acidic properties very different from regular alkyl boranes as a result of the attractive London Dispersion Force interactions. In addition, the Power group investigates a variety of disproportionation and dissociation reactions in both the main group and transition elements that are strongly influenced by LDF. Examples involve the synthesis of the first stable, two-coordinate copper(II) derivative. Normally, low-coordinate copper(II) compounds are unstable due to auto-reduction to copper(I) species or copper metal. Using a ligand that favors LDF interactions, the reverse reaction, auto oxidation, occurs so that a stable two-coordinate copper(II) species is obtained from a copper(I) starting material. A similar effect enables the synthesis of the first two-coordinate vanadium(II) compound. The investigations have also shown that LDF effects are important for the multiple-bonded heavier main group compounds, where such effects usually exceed the weak element-element bonding.  LDFs are responsible for the stability of numerous multiple bonded heavier main group compounds. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows are supported through this award. The knowledge gained may be fundamental to our understanding of bonding and how more complex structures are built."

At the same time, understanding how this mantle convection is actually operating is difficult and subject to large uncertainty, because it is mostly hidden from our eyes, except for its surface manifestation known as plate tectonics. One of the fundamental questions regarding mantle convection is how efficiently it can mix things up, and the efficiency of convective mixing has a number of important bearings on how mantle convection has shaped the history of the Earth and its surface environment. In this project, we will apply a state-of-the-art seismic imaging technique to the USArray data, to detect small-scale heterogeneities in the mantle surrounding the North American continent. The distribution of small-scale heterogeneities, when interpreted in the context of the tectonic history of a relevant mantle section, has a potential to elucidate the long-term mixing efficiency of mantle convection. <br/><br/>In the last few years, the PI has been developing new data processing tools to overcome various difficulties associated with the detection of small-scale mantle heterogeneities, including a powerful signal detection technique called dual bootstrap stacking (DBS) and a teleseismic migration method based on DBS. Seismic migration is an imaging technique in which seismic energy recorded at surface receivers is projected back to its origin in the subsurface. As it directly uses the entire waveform of seismic data, migration has a potential to achieve the highest spatial resolution allowed by the given data. The Transportable Array of USArray finished its eastward migration in 2013, and the time is ripe to explore the vast wealth of USArray data by DBS-based teleseismic migration in a systematic manner. Given a large number of possible source-receiver combinations and a variety of scattering mechanisms to be exploited, this project focuses on the following two objectives as the top priorities: (1) parallelization of DBS-based migration, and (2) searching for small-scale heterogeneities in the mantle around the North American continent with P-to-P scattering. The DBS-based migration is a very time-consuming processing, but with the planned code parallelization, it will become possible to process a large volume of data. The P-coda part of seismograms, bounded by the direct P arrival and the PP phase, is suitable to be searched for potential scattered phases generated by S-to-P and P-to-P scattering. Because of travel times involved, S-to-P scattering can illuminate only the vicinity of earthquakes, but P-to-P scattering can probe all along the ray path of the direct P. The use of differential travel times with respect to the direct P limits the source-receiver distance to be shorter than &#8764;100, but a number of good seismic sources (i.e., deeper than 100 km and Mw &#8805;5.0) around the Pacific will allow us to image scatterers in the mantle beneath the Northern Pacific, Central America, and possibly the Northern Atlantic."

As the key protocol that supports WWW, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been very successful. It accounts for more than half of the overall Internet traffic. Currently, the most widely deployed HTTP version is HTTP/1.1 standardized 16 years ago. Nonetheless, several new web protocols (""NWP"") such as HTTP/2, SPDY, and QUIC have been proposed recently to overcome limitations of HTTP/1.1. In particular, HTTP/2, the next version of HTTP, has been standardized in 2015 and started replacing HTTP/1.1. NWP will become prevalent in the foreseeable future. Given the importance of these web protocols, the objective of this project is to understand them, and to propose effective solutions for improving web performance by leveraging their common new features. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project identifies key dimensions of NWP that were not explored before, and includes the following research tasks. (1) The principal investigator (PI) will conduct a comprehensive user study by collecting web traffic from voluntary participants, to understand NWP's performance ""in the wild"". The measurement results not only shed light on improving the performance, energy efficiency, and mobile-friendliness of current NWP, but also provide benchmarks for evaluating future NWP. (2) The PI will investigate how to strategically leverage Server Push, a new feature of many NWP, to improve web performance. Server push allows a server to preemptively send (push) resources to the client, thus overcoming many limitations of the conventional ""request-response"" resource fetching paradigm. (3) The PI will study how to optimize NWP performance by simultaneously leveraging multiple interfaces (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular on mobile devices). A new framework promises to allow multipath to be adaptively utilized only when necessary, in order to reduce the energy consumption and cellular data usage for mobile devices. (4) The PI also explores mechanisms for improving the interaction between NWP and the underlying transport layer such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Successful completion of this research will benefit the society, due to the importance of web protocols in our everyday computing. It is known that Internet users are very sensitive to web page load time. The proposed solutions will improve web users' experience, and they can be deployed on browser and server applications to yield immediate benefits. Note the proposed solutions do not rely on a specific web protocol, and can therefore yield long-term benefits. Dissemination of the research results will be done through academic publications, code/data distribution, industrial collaborations, and standardization. The PI has included HTTP/2 in the course he taught, and will incorporate more NWP materials into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will  mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies.<br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

Alpha-synuclein forms two types of aggregates: mature fibrils and oligomers.  The mature fibrils are known to be non-toxic, but oligomers can cause the death of the neuronal cells by forming pore structure in the cell membrane.  Understanding the structure of oligomer aggregates should provide clues for the development of therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease.

In addition, a new laboratory experiment on peptide synthesis for a graduate level organic chemistry class is being developed.  <br/><br/>Various techniques have been developed to determine the structure of proteins.  Among them, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy  (FTIR) provides a fast response and has been used to evaluate various conformations (such as alpha-helix, beta-sheet, unstructured conformation) in proteins and peptides.  This method utilizes the amide I band, which arises from the stretching mode of the carbonyl group in the backbone amide bonds.  Traditional FTIR can only provide information about an overall fraction of the conformations.  To expand its capability, 13C labels can be introduced to the carbonyls in the backbone amide bonds and a new band (the 13C amide I band) can be generated to determine the conformation of specific residues.  In this project, 13C labels are introduced into the sequence of alpha-synuclein to study the conformation of the oligomers of alpha-synuclein at the residue level.  In addition, Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy is used to address the orientation of 13C labeled carbonyls.  With both conformation and orientation information, the structure of alpha-synuclein can be evaluated in phospholipid bilayer structures."

Taxi markets in places like New York City resemble a competitive market in some important ways; particularly the presence of a large number of independent participants who do not have market power. However, they also feature impediments, or frictions, to the smooth functioning of such competition. Some of these frictions are regulatory, such as the limits to entry, pricing, and ownership. Some are features of the way the products are delivered. For instance, there is an important ""matching friction"" that derives from the fact that taxi drivers have limited knowledge about the location of potential passengers, leading to wasteful search or waiting. This project develops and estimates a model that attempts to measure these frictions and discusses policies that may reduce these distortions. It also considers the effects of entrants such as Uber. The PIs study New York City because of the availability of extremely detailed data and because of some interesting features of that market. <br/><br/>The first part of the project estimates a dynamic general equilibrium model with matching frictions of the New York City taxi-cab market. The second part of the project explores questions that rely more intensively on the detailed spatial information in the data. The PIs discuss how well drivers coordinate their decisions, and how well they use available information. They propose a novel approach to deal with limitations on the potential to directly observe demand. Because the amount of time a taxi searches for passengers is observed, the PIs can recover the number of waiting customers by using the fact that search is a well-defined spatial process. On the supply-side, potential drivers make a daily entry decision and an hourly stopping decision. These must then be aggregated to be consistent with equilibrium earnings. The wait time and the number of taxis are jointly determined endogenously as part of the competitive equilibrium in this market. The PIs use data from New York City with information on every single cab trip from 2010 to 2013. They propose counterfactuals relaxing entry and ownership restrictions. They also propose a counterfactual that changes the matching technology: a centralized dispatcher who sends empty cabs to the closest passenger. They examine gains in efficiency with reductions in wait times for both passengers and taxis as a function of the fraction of the market controlled by the dispatcher. This is relevant for thinking about the effect of firms such as Uber. In the second part of the project the PIs propose to systematically explore how outcomes change under different types of centralized matching procedures to better understand the role and importance of various frictions. They can also obtain information about the (equilibrium) degree of coordination among taxis. There can be multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria with different degrees of market segmentation. The project aims to evaluate the effects of this market segmentation. This project has many potential impacts beyond the obvious policy implications for the NYC taxi market. It can allow researchers to quantify the distortions of some existing regulations, such as the inflexibility of the fare structures. With recent advances in technology, many markets are now faced with the possibility of alternative modes of organization. This structural approach allows the PIs to explore the potential for such alternative organization. These have relevance for other markets with spatial frictions and a need for rapid delivery of service."

Fish are in direct contact with water, and they must actively take up salts from freshwater and actively secrete them in seawater to be able to regulate internal salt concentrations.  To date research on the hormonal control of salt regulation has been limited to studies on advanced fish species.  This project will examine the hormonal control of salt regulation in two basal vertebrates, lamprey eel and sturgeon.  The researchers will examine how growth hormone and prolactin, two hormones secreted by the pituitary gland, and their receptors are altered by external salinity. This research will determine the effect of these hormones on the ability of lamprey and sturgeon to tolerate changes in external salinity.  The results of these studies will yield insights about the functional evolution of these hormones, which in turn could be applied to enhancing agricultural production of fish and management of invasive lamprey.  The results will be rapidly transferred to textbooks in comparative endocrinology and physiology, published in peer-reviewed journals, and shared at scientific meetings. <br/><br/>Studies supported by this award will investigate the functional evolution of osmoregulatory hormones in aquatic vertebrates. Our current understanding of the hormonal control of osmoregulation in aquatic vertebrates comes almost entirely from advanced bony fish (teleosts), and there is no information on how pituitary hormones control osmoregulation in basal vertebrates. It is now well-established that prolactin (PRL) is critical for survival of most teleosts in freshwater (FW) and that growth hormone (GH), at least in some lineages, promotes osmoregulation in seawater (SW). Lamprey, as basal vertebrates, and chondrosteans (including sturgeon), as basal bony fish, have the same osmoregulatory strategy as teleosts (namely, maintaining nearly constant levels of plasma ions irrespective of external salinity), yet there is currently no information on whether PRL or GH play a role in osmoregulation of either lamprey or chondrosteans. There is strong evidence that lamprey possess only one member of the PRL/GH family of pituitary hormones (GH), making them especially critical for these studies. Our specific aims are: 1) to determine the response of GH and GH receptor to salinity change in lamprey; 2) to determine the osmoregulatory actions of GH in lamprey; and 3) to determine the osmoregulatory roles of GH and PRL in sturgeon. For each species we will examine the time course of physiological and endocrine responses to reciprocal transfers between FW and SW.  We will utilize recombinant technology to make lamprey GH in order to develop homologous radioimmuno- and radioreceptor- assays, and determine its osmoregulatory actions in vivo and in vitro."

This new instrument will improve our understanding of the history of star formation during a poorly studied period when the universe was evolving rapidly. The planned measurements will constrain the density of star formation and establish the technique of ionized carbon detection as a new, viable way of probing the early history of the forming universe.

This will be accomplished through intensity mapping of [CII] in order to detect clustering fluctuations and test the predicted [CII] amplitudes of faint emission from the earliest dwarf galaxies. A [CII] detection with TIME-Pilot would constrain the density of EoR star formation and would make [CII] emission a viable new tool for understanding the EoR. Crites will focus on both completing the development of the TIME-Pilot instrument and conducting an analysis of the systematic effects from the foreground that will need to be accommodated in order to extract the [CII] signal. High school students in the outreach program will receive classroom visits describing the practice of science, followed by a small number of students being invited to work with the TIME-Pilot group's laboratory for hands-on experience during the summer."

The coupling interaction between these waves is believed to be a source of strong variability that is transmitted into the upper atmosphere and ionosphere as secondary wave structures that could potentially affect navigation, communications and radar tracking systems. Understanding the origins of such variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region is one of the major challenges faced in space physics. This award would focus on studying these large-scale wave interactions and the secondary waves they produce by using a year-long dataset generated by the use of a NCAR general circulation model (TIME-GCM), coupled to the use of the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) that would provide simulations of the lower atmosphere inputs into the upper atmosphere model. The broader impacts of the research effort will be realized in several different ways: (a) engagement with a diverse population of students through partnership with the Broadening Opportunity through Leadership and Diversity (BOLD) Center; (b) engaging an undergraduate student in the research through the Discovery Learning Apprentice (DLA) Program; (c) leveraging the above connections to teach graduate students how to mentor. <br/><br/>For individual cases where non-linear interactions are seen, a non-linear version of the GSWM model will be employed to perform numerical experiments, investigating factors such as how the phases of the two primary waves impact the generation of the secondary waves. The primary objectives of the work are as follows:  1) to delineate and understand the basic mechanisms underlying the interactions between PWs and tides propagating up from the lower atmosphere, 2) to quantify the variability imposed on the global atmosphere-ionosphere system by these interactions, and 3) to assess the implications for ground-based and space-based observing systems."

The traditional arithmetic Langlands program has been studied for more than fifty years, and this research has resulted in significant applications to solving classical Diophantine equations, for example, the proof of Fermat's last theorem. The geometric Langlands program, which is relatively new, is under rapid development thanks to powerful tools from algebraic geometry. This geometric formulation has led to a precise conjecture known as the global geometric Langlands conjecture that encodes deep connections between number theory and geometry. This research project is devoted to verifying a refined version of this conjecture.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project focuses on two topics in the general area of the geometric Langlands program: verifying the global geometric Langlands conjecture in the de Rham setting and duality for the Hitchin fibration. In previous work, the investigator introduced a corrected formulation of the global geometric Langlands conjecture, which led to a detailed roadmap towards the proof of the conjecture. The first goal of the project is to verify the refined conjecture.  The second part of the project studies a new approach to the duality of the Hitchin fibrations for Langlands dual groups based on the study of classical limits of the Hecke functors."

Focused primarily on varieties defined by polynomial equations, algebraic geometry is an ancient subject that plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and applied, as well as in physics. The main theme of this project is that a broad class of geometric objects, so called Calabi-Yau varieties, come with a natural system of coordinates.  Informally speaking, creatures living on a Calabi-Yau variety should be able to perceive natural, intrinsic quantities whose values determine their precise position. As these geometric objects play a fundamental role in diverse areas of mathematics, these intrinsic quantities should play a similar fundamental role in theoretical physics, particularly in superstring theory. Since string theory models suggest that extra dimensions of spacetime comprise a Calabi-Yau variety, this study suggests there are corresponding fundamental intrinsic quantities, not yet understood, in our world. This research project aims to deepen and advance knowledge in this field.<br/><br/>The main objective of the proposed research is to continue the investigator's collaborative work to generalize the classical theory of theta functions for abelian varieties to polarized Calabi-Yau varieties, both open (i.e. log) and compact. More precisely, the goal is to give a canonical basis for the vector space of global sections, and a formula for the structure constants for the multiplication rule in the coordinate ring, expressed in the canonical basis, as counts of holomorphic disks on the mirror. The existence of such generalized theta functions points to the existence of a geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space, vastly generalizing the compactificaton of polarized abelian varieties and the theory of the secondary polytope, and at the same time suggests a synthetic construction of the mirror in terms of the canonically described ring. The project includes a detailed scheme for constructing the compactification in dimension two, and the synthetic construction of the mirror in full generality, by counting rigid analytic disks."

This observation goes back to Fermat and Euler, and broadly speaking it says that, by the laws of nature, things are carried out in the most economical way. The phenomenon applies to many facets of physics, including Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, even general relativity. The abstract mathematical framework that studies such phenomena is the calculus of variations, and the principal investigator will apply this in the context of differential geometry. Namely, in differential geometry one often has a large collection of geometric objects (in this case Kahler metrics or Lagrangians) and is searching for special elements in this collection that have the nicest properties. These special elements often minimize a certain energy functional, and this is the starting point of the project. A thorough understanding of the problems at hand can lead to new insight into the shape of the universe, and it would help make exciting predictions in string theory and, more broadly, in theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This project can be split into three main subjects: characterizing existence of constant scalar curvature metrics on Kahler manifolds; convexity and curvature properties of the L^p-Finsler geometry of the space of Kahler metrics, their finite dimensional approximations, and the structure of the associated space of geodesic rays; the metric structure of the space of positive Lagrangians. As a novelty, in the proposed study we will either specifically develop or use an adequate metric geometry, in hopes of understanding the underlying variational problems better. The metric spaces that the PI plans to use arise from the path length structure of infinite dimensional Finsler manifolds, and as such have a very rich geometry themselves. In the Kahler case it is hopeful that this will allow one to connect many notions of stability, including K-stability from the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, the energy properness of Tian, and geodesic stability, all conjectured to characterize existence of constant scalar curvature metrics. In the case of Lagrangian geometry much less is known. Following a recent program proposed by Solomon, the principal investigator intends to develop the underlying metric geometry further in order to formulate and prove stability conditions characterizing existence of special Lagrangians."

The power of  combinatorics lies in its ability to illuminate and clarify the structure of representations. A basic yet guiding example of this phenomenon is the famous formula expressing a Schur polynomial as a weighted sum over semi-standard Young tableaux. In this project, the PIs will study Koornwinder polynomials, double affine Hecke algebras (DAHAs), and their large-rank stabilizations. An important theme of the project is the universality of Koornwinder polynomials. This has two facets. First, by specialization of parameters, the Koornwinder polynomials project to the Macdonald polynomials of all classical and mixed affine types. The proposed research aims to prove analogues in the Koornwinder case of celebrated results on type A Macdonald polynomials; specialization then projects such results onto classical and mixed types. An example is the integrality property of type A Macdonald polynomials, which has deep connections to combinatorics and geometry. The second facet of universality is that of large-rank stabilization.This involves applications to creation operators for the Koornwinder polynomials, specializations to deformed universal characters, duality and stabilization of torus knot polynomials, canonical bases of stable DAHA, and elliptic Kostka polynomials for classical types. The training of graduate students, through their direct involvement as research assistants, is an important component of the project. The project will also involve substantial symbolic computation. All resulting software will be made publicly available in the open-source software system Sage.<br/><br/>The PIs will develop a stable (large rank) limit of the spherical DAHA of Koornwinder type and use this study the combinatorics of Koornwinder polynomials and their lifts to symmetric functions.

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

They plan to test the novel hypothesis that some wasps are able to move onto new hosts, and that these host shifts ultimately lead to decreased genetic differences among wasp species, and thus a breakdown of species' barriers. The project will have important implications for agriculture and food production because the same processes at work in this fig-fig wasp system also determine crop-pest and crop-pollinator relationships. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training. A unique educational aspect of the project is the International Field Trip in Biology course, which will allow 12 undergraduates per year to conduct international field research in Panama. <br/><br/>The research approach is multidisciplinary, involving phylogenetics, population genetics, and volatile chemistry. Genomic sequencing will be used to: 1) obtain well-resolved evolutionary trees of genetic relatedness among Central American fig and fig wasp species, 2) identify subsets of fig species that are, unexpectedly, interbreeding (hybridizing) with each other, and 3) link hybridization of figs to changes in the floral ""perfumes"" used to attract pollinators, and which are also exploited by parasites to locate host plants.

Unlike pathogens that cause plant disease, fungal endophytes can be beneficial for their plant hosts. Due to their variety of health benefits for plants, there is currently great interest in using endophytes in sustainable agriculture and biological control. Although recent research has begun characterizing endophyte communities and their functions in agricultural crops and other plants, we lack basic knowledge of how endophytes benefit the plants in which they live. Just as we understand the mechanisms by which drugs promote human health, understanding the mechanisms by which endophytes interact with plant physiology and the immune system is imperative for using these fungi in restoration ecology and sustainable agriculture. This research will work to uncover these mechanisms, improving knowledge of how and why plants and fungal endophytes form and maintain their beneficial relationships. Additionally, this research will train undergraduate students, as well as high school students.<br/><br/>This research will use Theobroma cacao, the cacao tree, as a host species for studying assembly, maintenance, and function of the plant-endophyte interaction. First, the researchers will use total RNA sequencing to understand how changes in plant and fungal gene expression underlie increased plant pathogen resistance following application of leaf litter to conspecific seedlings. The researchers expect that exposure to leaf litter, a source of endophytic inoculum, will not only alter baseline gene expression in plants, but will also change how plants respond genetically to pathogen infection. Second, this project will use stable-isotope techniques to track the nutrient exchange between plants and endophytes, and determine if plants ""pay"" endophytes to mount an immune response against their enemies. The researchers hypothesize that plants can direct nutrients toward more beneficial endophytic fungi."

Many ocean-dwelling animal species have a free-living larval stage, which is generally one of two major types. They are either long-lived, feeding larvae that develop over the course of months to years, or short-lived, non-feeding larvae that develop in a matter of hours to days. Larval type (feeding or non-feeding) has many important ecological and evolutionary ramifications, as it influences the size of species' ranges, connections between populations, and the potential for speciation and extinction. Although evolutionary transitions from feeding to non-feeding larvae occur frequently, we know little about the genetic changes that underlie these transitions. This project will test the hypothesis that larval development type depends upon certain maternal effects: messenger RNA (mRNA) in the eggs. The researchers will collect mRNA sequencing data from eggs of sand dollar and sea biscuit species to determine if differing developmental types are associated with different maternal mRNA. In addition, the project will support the training of minority undergraduate researchers and the creation of a public exhibit at a nature center.<br/><br/>Preliminary research on two closely related species of echinoderm sea biscuits, which exhibit different larval developmental modes, demonstrated that larval developmental patterns are strongly driven by maternal factors. Although such maternal effects also drive the developmental patterns of larvae in several other systems, the underlying cause of this maternal effect remains unclear. This project will test the novel hypothesis that the strong maternal effect on development is due to differences in maternally deposited mRNA. The researchers will sequence the maternally deposited mRNA from unfertilized eggs of several closely related species pairs of sand dollars and sea biscuits that have alternate larval types. These data will also be used to create a time-calibrated phylogeny to correct for phylogenetic signal. Using these data, the project will determine how maternally deposited mRNA differs in eggs of feeding and non-feeding echinoderm larvae, and how those differences influence the evolution of alternate developmental pathways."

The adaptive growing rod is important because of its potential to reduce the high incidence of implant loosening and failure, which are the primary sources of complications in the treatment of severe early-onset scoliosis in children and often necessitate costly and painful revision surgeries.  The project will result in a working prototype of an adaptive growing rod and demonstrate its feasibility in a standardized biomechanics model. This device has the unique features of simultaneous high strength and ultra-low stiffness matching that of human bone, and the ability to vary its stiffness depending on location.   When compared to the leading competing growing rods based on the Harrington rods system in this market, these features reduce the number of revision procedures required by reducing a leading source of complications, facilitating healthy development of the spine from better load sharing, and improving the overall efficacy for treatment of severe scoliosis in children.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: there is a current lack of quantitative understanding of how stress at the bone-screw interface is affected by implant stiffness in growing rod constructs.  This is important because high stress at the bone-screw interface is believed to be responsible for implant loosening and pull-outs.  Furthermore, it is not known how location-dependent implant stiffness modifies such stress.  The project seeks to bridge these gaps by quantitatively monitoring how stress at the bone-screw interface is affected by variations in the implant stiffness introduced by microstructural engineering and thermo-mechanical training in a Ti-Nb alloy.  Experiments are performed using a modified ASTM standard model that accounts for the changing stiffness of the growing spine.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a Ph.D. level graduate student and undergraduate researchers, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through direct involvement in the customer development process.  Students will participate in all conversations with surgeons, hospital officials, regulatory personnel, and medical devices manufacturers.  Students will be asked to make customer contacts independently, and receive training of the lean-startup strategy central to the NSF I-Corps program.    <br/><br/>The project engages pediatric orthopedic surgeons and a medical devices manufacturer to ensure a clear and current understanding of clinical needs and challenges, as well as regulatory and reimbursement hurdles of this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

The classical theory of these operators was designed to work on smooth functions. However, nature often provides us with very irregular media with which to engage. This creates the need for a very low-regularity form of the theory of singular integrals, which the principal investigators on this project have constructed. A consequence of the low-regularity theory is that through the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a Euclidean space of a very high dimension, one can sometimes conclude that the set itself is of a much lower dimension than the ambient space, an important piece of information from the perspective of data science. To refine this approach to data analysis is one of the main goals of this project. <br/><br/>This project considers several problems in nonhomogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme uniting the problems is the behavior of singular operators with very good (Calderon-Zygmund) kernels in very bad environments (e.g., on sets with no a priori structure, in spaces with matrix weights). Specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) the David-Semmes problem to characterize the rectifiability of sets and measures in high-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the boundedness of the corresponding Riesz transforms; (2) the geometry of reflection-less measures; (3) the geometric characterization of higher-dimensional analogues of positive analytic capacity; (4) two-weight estimates for very simple singular operators in the non-Hilbert setting; and (5) sharp estimates for classical operators with matrix weights. Singular integral operators with respect to bad measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the reasons for their increasing interest in recent years has been the study of analytic capacity. While the theory for the two-dimensional case (i.e., the Cauchy transform on the complex plane) and the theory of analytic capacity that emerged as its by-product are now very well understood, the analogous theory in higher dimensions has not been fully developed. The main roadblock here is the lack of geometric tools in higher dimensions. Additionally, in higher dimensions, nonhomogeneous situations arise more often than in the plane and more often one might expect. For example, boundary value problems in (otherwise smooth) domains with cusps lead to nonhomogeneous problems, because, unlike what happens in the two-dimensional setting, surface measure on the boundary of such a domain is non-doubling. This becomes an even more vexing problem if one wants to consider harmonic measure estimates for domains on whose boundaries ""surface measure"" is practically arbitrary. This is an important issue that the project seeks to confront."

In more complex animals, such as vertebrates, hormones and the receptors to which they bind are critical signaling molecules involved in regulation of salt and water transport.  Fish are in direct contact with water, and they must actively take up salts from freshwater and actively secrete them in seawater to be able to regulate internal salt concentrations.  To date research on the hormonal control of salt regulation has been limited to studies on advanced fish species.  This project will examine the hormonal control of salt regulation in two basal vertebrates, lamprey eel and sturgeon.  The researchers will examine how growth hormone and prolactin, two hormones secreted by the pituitary gland, and their receptors are altered by external salinity. This research will determine the effect of these hormones on the ability of lamprey and sturgeon to tolerate changes in external salinity.  The results of these studies will yield insights about the functional evolution of these hormones, which in turn could be applied to enhancing agricultural production of fish and management of invasive lamprey.  The results will be rapidly transferred to textbooks in comparative endocrinology and physiology, published in peer-reviewed journals, and shared at scientific meetings. <br/><br/>Studies supported by this award will investigate the functional evolution of osmoregulatory hormones in aquatic vertebrates. Our current understanding of the hormonal control of osmoregulation in aquatic vertebrates comes almost entirely from advanced bony fish (teleosts), and there is no information on how pituitary hormones control osmoregulation in basal vertebrates. It is now well-established that prolactin (PRL) is critical for survival of most teleosts in freshwater (FW) and that growth hormone (GH), at least in some lineages, promotes osmoregulation in seawater (SW). Lamprey, as basal vertebrates, and chondrosteans (including sturgeon), as basal bony fish, have the same osmoregulatory strategy as teleosts (namely, maintaining nearly constant levels of plasma ions irrespective of external salinity), yet there is currently no information on whether PRL or GH play a role in osmoregulation of either lamprey or chondrosteans. There is strong evidence that lamprey possess only one member of the PRL/GH family of pituitary hormones (GH), making them especially critical for these studies. Our specific aims are: 1) to determine the response of GH and GH receptor to salinity change in lamprey; 2) to determine the osmoregulatory actions of GH in lamprey; and 3) to determine the osmoregulatory roles of GH and PRL in sturgeon. For each species we will examine the time course of physiological and endocrine responses to reciprocal transfers between FW and SW.  We will utilize recombinant technology to make lamprey GH in order to develop homologous radioimmuno- and radioreceptor- assays, and determine its osmoregulatory actions in vivo and in vitro."

For example, various geological records suggest that the Andes Mountains started to shorten significantly since at least 40 million years ago. However, paleo-altimetry proxy data reveal that most of the surface elevation of the Andes remained relatively low until as late as 20 or 15 million years ago, a time frame that is inconsistent with the shortening history. Furthermore, the early Cenozoic arc volcanism along the central Andes suddenly shifted more than 500 km inland around 30 million years ago and formed widespread silicic volcanic activity that continues to the present. Consequently, a clear relationship among these tectonic events is lacking. An important reason is that both the mantle structures beneath South America and their dynamic evolution remain poorly understood. In this proposal, the team plans to carry out a multidisciplinary research project to attempt to improve our knowledge about the observational records of surface tectonics, deep mantle seismic properties, and their geodynamic relationship with the temporal evolution of subduction beneath the continent. By collecting more data related to the tectonic history of South America and to the present-day mantle interior, they will build a sophisticated 4-dimentional geodynamic model using data assimilation, in order to quantitatively reproduce the past subduction history. Ultimately, the team hopes to better understand the Cenozoic evolution of the South American continent.  The team plans to achieve this goal through a collaborative research effort that involves seismology (led by PI Beck), geology (led by PI DeCelles), and geodynamics (led by PI Liu). They propose to reproduce the Cenozoic subduction history beneath South America and associated continental deformation using geodynamic models constrained by geophysical and geological observations. This project includes interdisciplinary training of several graduate students at two institutions, and also involves undergraduates at both institutions who will be involved in the research and will all students will participate in a summer field trip to western U.S. Cordillera as an analog for the South American Cordillera.   This multi-disciplinary combination will provide a unique opportunity for the students to understand orogenic systems at plate scale.<br/><br/>Multiple fundamental questions exist about the Cenozoic tectonic history of South America, including the asynchronous crustal shortening and surface uplift/subsidence history of the Andes, and the enigmatic Central Andean flare-up magmatism occurring during the late Cenozoic. None of the earlier proposed geodynamic models for the Cenozoic evolution of South America could simultaneously explain all these tectonic records and it is unclear whether these different physical processes could co-exist and interact in reality. An important reason for the existence of these alternative models is the uncertain subduction and mantle dynamics due to our imperfect knowledge of deep mantle structures beneath South America. Key observational constraints on the geodynamic and tectonic evolution include an improved present-day mantle seismic structure, especially in the lower mantle, a better identified relationship among structural deformation, surface uplift and magmatic history within western South America, and time-dependent geodynamic models that are consistent with these observational records."

Transformation of the sheet into a useful component typically occurs in multiple steps, with the part transferred from one forming die to the next, progressively obtaining a more complex shape. While these multi-step processes enable the creation of complex components, they also increase the cost due to the number of dies and presses needed. Also, from a scientific point of view, the multiple steps cause repeated loading and unloading of the materials, which is very challenging to model in a computationally-efficient way. This research aims to create a material model suitable for repeated loading and unloading, to enable science-based process and die design, minimize the number of necessary steps, reduce waste and thus enhance the competitiveness of American manufacturing. Since the automotive industry is one of the major users of multi-step sheet forming, this research will also enable the use of modern, difficult-to-form steels and aluminum alloys in auto-bodies, yielding safer and environmentally friendlier cars. The work will be performed in collaboration with 2 Korean universities (whose work is funded by the Korean National Research Foundation), and this collaboration will allow access to equipment and expertise not otherwise available in the US.

Understanding how new species originate from existing ones is a major goal in biology. After new species are formed, both ecological and genetic forces may act to preserve species boundaries, prevent hybridization, and maintain biodiversity.  It is unclear if these forces act similarly at population, species, and higher taxonomic levels. A comprehensive understanding of how biodiversity is generated and maintained in a single group of plants will inform basic models of the maintenance of Earth's biodiversity. It will also guide important conservation and management decisions for small, isolated, or fragmented populations.  This research will provide training of a graduate student and several undergraduate research assistants. It will also provide citizens with a richer context for understanding plant biodiversity through public outreach efforts on California's plant biodiversity.  <br/><br/>Previous research at the middle and late stages of speciation in the plant clade Streptanthus suggests that both genetic incompatibilities and divergent ecology contribute to the maintenance of species-level diversity.  Experimental hybridizations show that genetic incompatibility increases with species divergence times. Some recently diverged species pairs can, however, still produce viable hybrid offspring in the greenhouse.  Field research shows that ecological differences in such species, including microhabitat affinity, pollinator preferences and constancy, and phenology may play a role in maintaining potential interbreeders as distinct species in nature.  It is unclear whether the same ecological and evolutionary forces act at different stages of the speciation continuum, or if distinct genetic and ecological forces are characteristic of each stage of speciation.  This research delves deeper into the early stages of speciation in Streptanthus, by focusing on population divergence and early reproductive isolation at the population level.  Experimental hybridizations and Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing will be used to examine patterns of genetic relatedness among multiple geographically and environmentally divergent populations of S. breweri. The same techniques will also be used to analyze the influence of genetic, geographic, and environmental distance, on reproductive isolation at the population level.  This research complements previous work in Streptanthus, providing new data on population-level processes, which will illuminate patterns of reproductive isolation observed at the species level, and provide a comprehensive view of the speciation process within a single study system."

The generality of obtaining new oxidation states with coordination environments that allow higher-lying orbitals to be populated is being explored synthetically.  Because new oxidation states expand opportunities to do redox chemistry, Professor Evans is examining the reaction chemistry and photochemistry of these complexes.  The mixed electron configuration of these compounds may lead to an unusual combination of transition metal and rare earth chemistry.  The influence of the mixed configuration on physical properties of the compounds is also being studied, because the Ho2+ complex has the highest magnetic susceptibility, 11.4 mu-B, ever observed for a monometallic complex.

The classical theory of these operators was designed to work on smooth functions. However, nature often provides us with very irregular media with which to engage. This creates the need for a very low-regularity form of the theory of singular integrals, which the principal investigators on this project have constructed. A consequence of the low-regularity theory is that through the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a Euclidean space of a very high dimension, one can sometimes conclude that the set itself is of a much lower dimension than the ambient space, an important piece of information from the perspective of data science. To refine this approach to data analysis is one of the main goals of this project. <br/><br/>This project considers several problems in nonhomogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme uniting the problems is the behavior of singular operators with very good (Calderon-Zygmund) kernels in very bad environments (e.g., on sets with no a priori structure, in spaces with matrix weights). Specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) the David-Semmes problem to characterize the rectifiability of sets and measures in high-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the boundedness of the corresponding Riesz transforms; (2) the geometry of reflection-less measures; (3) the geometric characterization of higher-dimensional analogues of positive analytic capacity; (4) two-weight estimates for very simple singular operators in the non-Hilbert setting; and (5) sharp estimates for classical operators with matrix weights. Singular integral operators with respect to bad measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the reasons for their increasing interest in recent years has been the study of analytic capacity. While the theory for the two-dimensional case (i.e., the Cauchy transform on the complex plane) and the theory of analytic capacity that emerged as its by-product are now very well understood, the analogous theory in higher dimensions has not been fully developed. The main roadblock here is the lack of geometric tools in higher dimensions. Additionally, in higher dimensions, nonhomogeneous situations arise more often than in the plane and more often one might expect. For example, boundary value problems in (otherwise smooth) domains with cusps lead to nonhomogeneous problems, because, unlike what happens in the two-dimensional setting, surface measure on the boundary of such a domain is non-doubling. This becomes an even more vexing problem if one wants to consider harmonic measure estimates for domains on whose boundaries ""surface measure"" is practically arbitrary. This is an important issue that the project seeks to confront."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Danelle Seymour is ""Exploring the causes and consequences of rapid transposon evolution in grass genomes"" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Irvine and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Brandon Gaut.<br/><br/>The most economically important crop species, including rice, maize, wheat, and barley are members of the grass family. The genomes of these species are extremely variable in size, and this is largely the result of rapid proliferation of mobile genetic elements, or transposons. While the genomic distribution of transposons in each species has been reported, the evolutionary forces that shape rapid, global changes in their distributions are unknown. This project aims to characterize the evolutionary forces that drive large changes in genome structure in eight grass species and whether such changes also have functional consequences. This project will provide the fellow with an evolutionary perspective important for connecting basic genomics research to plant phenotype, as well as the opportunity to provide long-term mentoring to undergraduates interested in genomics research.<br/><br/>Transposons are insertional mutagens and host genomes have evolved mechanisms to mitigate their spread. Transposon silencing can reduce transcription of flanking endogenous genes, but the duration of these changes is unclear due to the rapid evolution of inserted sequences. Exploring the interplay between these two forces, transposon proliferation and host silencing of transposition, is central to understanding how plant genomes evolve. This research aims to characterize the extent that transposon proliferation impacts the evolution of host genomes and ultimately the host phenotype using a comparative phylogenetic approach focusing on eight grass species. First, a unified framework for transposon identification and annotation in all eight species will be developed which will serve as an important community resource. Next, this resource will be used to characterize the role of transposons in the evolution of gene expression. Using a phylogenetic approach, it is possible to characterize the duration of transposon-induced phenotypic changes, in this case gene expression, and the extent that such changes shape the evolution of gene expression networks in this important plant family."

One of the fundamental issues when converting an analog (continuous) signal to a digital (discrete) one is the following question: Can the original signals be recovered from the samples, and if so, how accurately? The answer, of course, depends heavily on the nature of the signals that are being processed. For example, signals that are more complex (oscillatory) in nature require more samples for accurate reconstruction. The precise mathematical relationship between the rate of oscillation and the required rate of sampling is surprisingly delicate, especially when the samples are non-uniform. This project is centered on the problem of understanding precisely this relationship, including several other mathematical questions that arise naturally from it. <br/><br/>Analytic function spaces have always played an important role in the mathematical theory of signal processing. One natural class of such spaces that is particularly useful when studying non-uniform sampling is the class of de Branges spaces. Introduced in the sixties, the theory of de Branges spaces encompassed a great deal of mathematical analysis knowledge at that time, and it continues to play an important role in modern mathematics, providing a setting for the interplay of various areas of mathematics, including Fourier analysis, spectral theory, operator theory, random matrix theory, analytic number theory, and mathematical physics. The main research objective of this project is to conduct a deeper analysis of de Branges function spaces, and use the resulting findings to attack and resolve several long-standing open problems. Many of these problems are much more general in nature and go far beyond the setting of de Branges spaces. The reason that de Branges spaces serve as a model rests on the fact that this class of spaces already exhibits most of the key difficulties confronting signal processors. Another important goal of this project is to develop a theory that will unify the theory of classical function spaces, and use this unification as a guideline for developing new methods for resolving the remaining open questions about these spaces."

This convection drives plate tectonics, generating major societal hazards (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, etc.) and controls the compositional and thermal evolution of the planet. Since the early 1960s, quantifying the deformation properties of mantle rocks has been a major goal in experimental Earth Sciences. Advancement has been limited by technology, owing to serious difficulties in conducting experiments involving deformation of minerals at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth's deep interior.  The upper-mantle (top 410 km) consists of peridotites, rocks comprised dominantly of olivine, i.e., the semi-precious gem known as peridot. In the transition zone (410-670 km depth) at pressure in excess of 140,000 atm, olivine is no longer stable and transforms into high-pressure minerals, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, which have comparable compositions but denser structures.  Decades of experimental work have provided strong constraints on olivine plasticity, yet little is known about the viscosity of minerals in the transition-zone. The aim of the present project is to provide accurate computational models for the viscosity of Earth's transition zone, which will integrate new experimental data on wadsleyite and ringwoodite obtained in state-of-the art high-pressure deformation devices set at synchrotron facilities. These experiments, involving newly developed devices and analytical techniques, are at the forefront of research on the mechanical behavior of materials at high pressure. Besides advancing our understanding of mantle convection, this program will provide support and training in modern experimental science to one graduate student as well as undergraduate students. All the new experimental and analytical tools will become available to other scientists, advancing our general knowledge in high-pressure research. The team's results will find direct applications in Geophysics and Seismology, and broader applications in Materials Science. <br/><br/>Flow laws for Earth materials provide vital constraints on mantle dynamics, while knowledge of deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale provides insights into crucial observables such as seismic anisotropy. The complexity of the stress field within deforming rocks, which varies from grain to grain as plastic properties are anisotropic, can now be observed in situ using new high-pressure devices coupled with X-ray synchrotron radiation, and addressed by self-consistent mean-field modeling. In this project, the investigators will take advantage of these recent developments to address the plasticity of the transition zone. Specifically, they will study the flow properties of wadsleyite and ringwoodite as a function of iron and water contents, and constrain strength contrasts with olivine, using the Deformation-DIA apparatus and the newly developed D-TCup and DT-25.  In situ X-ray radiography and diffraction will be used to measure strain, stress and texture (i.e., lattice preferred orientation).  The new flow laws will be integrated into models for the effective viscosity and seismic anisotropy of the transition-zone. Modeling efforts will benefit from the second-order (SO) method, a recent improvement in mean-field schemes which describes accurately highly non-Newtonian materials, such as silicates. The models will account for stress-field heterogeneities due to crystal orientations, complex deformations mechanisms (dislocation glide and diffusion), incorporate several minerals, and improve confidence for extrapolation of results to geologic strain rates. The model construction will be flexible, allowing integration of additional phases and flow law parameters as they become available in the future. The outcome will give crucial insights on transition-zone viscosity, and the crystal preferred orientations that produce seismic anisotropy."

Initially, a single cell divides multiple times to generate an aggregate of 10-20 similar cells. Soon after, the progeny of these precursor cells differentiate and self-organize to form other structures. The remarkable feature of this process is its high level of reproducibility despite a number of sources of stochastic variation. In recent years, experimental interrogation has suggested multiple theories for what might be responsible for this process. It is still unclear, however, what drives organization, and in particular, what is responsible for its robustness. This project takes a joint experimental and modeling approach to address this issue. On the modeling side, a novel computational modeling platform will be developed that incorporates known and hypothesized physical and genetic processes to test their influence individually and jointly on development. On the experimental side, imaging and image analysis will be performed on mouse embryos to inform this model and test its predictions. This framework will be initially developed in relation to mouse development and later extended to determine how known differences between early mouse and human cells influence organization, which evidence suggests is less robust in developing human embryos.<br/><br/>This project will shed new light into how mammalian pre-implantation forms from a single cell. The research will also establish new principles for how the interplay between physical and biochemical regulatory processes leads to development of tissues an organisms of exquisite complexity.

In addition, this project will develop new training activities involving graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with an emphasis on promoting quantitative thinking and developing modeling and simulation skills. This training will equip students with computational and system-level approaches needed to investigate complex systems.

However, lake-dwelling cyanobacteria and their toxins, cyanotoxins, are of increasing concern, threatening the health of aquatic food webs and the safe uses of freshwaters. Most studies of cyanotoxins have focused on temperate and tropical systems with conspicuous surface blooms of planktonic cyanobacteria. However, not all toxin-producing cyanobacteria form surface blooms, both bottom-dwelling cyanobacteria and very small single cells in the water column, can produce toxins, and the abundance, impacts on organisms that consume the cyanobacteria, and the potential for toxins to move from lakes to the lands surrounding them is poorly understood, especially in polar regions. To date, very few studies have examined whether polar freshwater cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins and the extent to which cyanotoxins move through polar aquatic food webs or into terrestrial ecosystems remains largely unknown. This project will expand our understanding of the types of ecosystems that support toxic cyanobacteria and contribute to the evaluation of which systems are currently at risk or may become at risk in the future.  Studies of the cyanotoxins produced by both bottom-dwelling cyanobacteria and very small single cells in the water column will take place in lakes and ponds in Greenland. To complement ongoing studies of the most common class of cyanotoxin, the researchers will evaluate the production of four additional toxins and their transfer through aquatic food webs and into terrestrial ecosystems. As such, this project will expand the knowledge on the geographic and taxonomic range and ecological distribution of cyanotoxins relevant in both the scientific and public health communities.<br/><br/>The research funded by this grant will use samples previously collected from 19 lakes and ponds in southwestern Greenland to (1) quantify the abundance of four additional classes of cyanotoxins (anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, cylindrospermosins, and BMAA) within the aquatic ecosystem and (2) estimate cyanotoxin transfer to terrestrial ecosystems in order to obtain a more complete picture of within- and across-ecosystem movement of biotoxins in Arctic lakes and nearby terrestrial habitats. Preliminary data suggest that hepatoxic microcystins are produced and released by benthic colonial cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc and are also found in pelagic non-blooming phytoplankton. Moreover, microcystins are being transferred into zooplankton and invertebrate larvae. This research will extend these microcystin analyses into the terrestrial environment and investigate the presence of four additional cyanotoxins within the food web. The researchers will investigate toxin production, the transfer of cyanotoxins to other organisms in the lake, and several mechanisms (i.e., emerging insects, aerosols) that may influence the movement of toxins from the aquatic to terrestrial ecosystem. The already-documented presence and movement of cyanotoxins in these lakes demonstrate that high-latitude lakes can support toxigenic cyanobacteria, and that we may be underestimating the potential for these systems to develop high levels of toxicity in the future."

Multicomponent alloys, homogeneous mixtures of two or more metals, are used as catalysts in these reactions because they are more effective than any of the pure metal components by itself.  The relative metal compositions are variable over a wide range, which presents a challenge in designing alloy catalysts in finding the optimal relative amounts of each metal component for maximum catalyst efficiency. This can become a tedious and time-consuming research activity because it requires the preparation, characterization and catalytic evaluation of hundreds of different alloy catalysts, each with a different composition. Dr. Gellman has invented a rapid, high-throughput method to accelerate the study of three-component (ternary) alloy catalysts over a wide range of possible compositions.  Dr. Gellman fabricates a single material in which the composition of the alloy is varied continuously along the material surface.  He then uses a number of state-of-the-art spatially-resolved analytical tools.  Each measurement probes a catalyst alloy with a different composition.  This methods allows 100 catalyst compositions to be prepared at once, then characterized and studied in a fraction of the time that sequential preparation of each composition would allow.  Dr. Gellman is using his high-throughput method to understand how the composition of alloy catalysts influences the kinetics and selectivity of acetylene (HCCH) hydrogenation to ethylene (H2CCH2), an important chemical process in polymer production. Ultimately, Dr. Gellman's work may lead to improvement of alloy catalysts for numerous applications and may contribute to clean energy technologies for its relevance to hydrocarbon conversion.  In addition to his advancement of the field of catalysis, Dr. Gellman is making broader impacts in his work with students.

With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division and the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environment and Transport Systems Division, Dr. Andrew Gellman of Carnegie Mellon University addresses this challenge by using a unique set of high-throughput methods developed in his lab.  The analysis employs an alloy film containing all possible compositions of alloys in a process called Composition Spread Alloy Films (CSAF).  Ternary alloys, CuxAuyPd1-x-y, CuxAgyPd(1-x-y), and AgxAuyPd(1-x-y), are fabricated with x and y varied over the entire compositional range within an approximately 1 cm2 area sample size.  Spatially resolved surface analysis tools are used to map alloy characteristics, including bulk composition, surface composition and valence electronic structure, as a function of composition space.  A unique, 100 channel microreactor array is then used to make parallel measurements of the kinetics and selectivities of several catalytic processes, HD exchange, ethylene hydrogenation and acetylene hydrogenation, at 100 different alloy compositions.  Microkinetic analysis is used to extract the fundamental reaction parameters for elementary mechanistic steps. These measurements establish correlations among kinetic parameters and alloy characteristics and yield insight into rate dependence of individual elementary steps with alloy composition.

Frequent eruptions of tall ash clouds by Aleutian volcanoes present a significant hazard to local communities and to travelers flying from North America, Europe, and Asia. In order to mitigate this hazard, Alaskan volcanoes are extensively monitored by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), using seismic data, geodetic data and satellite imagery. These techniques are largely successful in enabling the prediction of volcanic eruptions; however, the links between precursor signals of an eruption (as inferred from seismic and geodetic data) and eruptive style are poorly understood. Factors that are thought to play a role in controlling the vigor of a volcanic eruption include the volatile content of the magma, the ascent rate of the magma in the volcanic conduit, and the temperature of the magma. These parameters are difficult to measure directly, but they can be inferred a posteriori from the analysis of erupted materials. The goal of the proposed work is to measure gradients of water and other chemical species in erupted crystals and glasses from three Aleutian arc volcanoes. These chemical gradients are signatures of magma ascent, degassing, and cooling. Recently developed techniques for interpreting such chemical gradients will be used to constrain ascent rates and temperatures of magmas in the minutes to hours prior to their eruption. Such measurements will further our understanding of processes operating in the volcanic conduit in the build-up to an eruption, and will provide a physical framework in which to place real-time volcano monitoring data.<br/><br/>The proposed study integrates recently developed petrologic methods for determining the ascent rates and syneruptive thermal histories of magmas erupted at three Aleutian arc volcanoes (Okmok, Seguam, and Pavlof) with contrasting explosivities (Volcanic Explosivity Index, VEI, of 1 ? 3). Magma ascent rates for each of the three eruptions will be calculated using three independent techniques: (1) water loss from olivine-hosted melt inclusions of different sizes; (2) water zonation in olivine; and (3) water zonation in clinopyroxene. Magma cooling histories during ascent and eruption will be calculated using MgO concentration gradients inside olivine-hosted melt inclusions. Integration of these techniques on samples from volcanoes with different eruptive styles will allow identification of relationships between magma volatile concentrations, ascent rate, thermal history, and eruptive style. The proposed analyses will enhance our understanding of the behavior of water and other volatile elements in olivine-hosted melt inclusions and in arc volcanoes more broadly, and they will enable more reliable and accurate determination of pre-eruptive volatile concentrations from olivine-hosted melt inclusions."

This process accounts for a significant fraction of aerosol particles in the atmosphere.  The underlying mechanisms governing aerosol particle formation are not well understood, leading to uncertainty about their impact on climate change. Due to the sub-nanometer size of newly formed particles, it is difficult to study them using conventional measurements. New techniques to create these particles are combined with recently developed laser spectroscopy methods to investigate the chemistry driving the formation of these particles. The results aid the refinement of models of new particle formation that can be used to improve weather and climate models. In the course of performing this work, young researchers from high school through graduate school are involved in the design, construction, and modification of sophisticated instrumentation and analysis tools.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of a new understanding of acid-base chemistry with minimal or no solvent. Though acid-base chemistry in solvents is well understood, new particle formation occurs largely via acid-base chemistry in air, and the role of water vapor in particle formation has not been well established. Clusters of a few acid and base molecules, chosen from those expected to play a role in new particle formation, are generated in a mass spectrometer and studied one specific composition at a time. In ion traps, clusters are exposed to atmospheric trace vapors and their growth is determined by mass spectrometry. Each cluster composition is characterized structurally using vibrational spectroscopy and energetically using temperature-controlled ion traps. These results reveal the energetic factors driving growth, how molecules arrange in the particle, the role of proton transfer between the acids and bases, and whether atmospheric vapors integrate into the acid-base salt structure or bind to its surface.  The results aid the refinement of models of new particle formation that can be used to improve weather and climate models."

Already, for many users, mobile phones are the only 'computer' they own. As a result, mobile Web pages are fast becoming the primary portal for content. However, loading a Web page on the mobile phone is exceedingly slow. There have been several optimizations designed to speed up Web pages, but there is no silver bullet: an optimization that speeds up one page can, and often does, slow down another page. One of the goals of this project is to shed light on why Web pages load slower on the phone as compared to a desktop. The project will use this bottleneck analysis to design algorithms, techniques, and tools, to accurately estimate if any given optimization will help or further slow down the page load time. The end goal of the project is a comprehensive analysis framework called ProfX that will help Web developers, network providers, browser vendors, and researchers design and choose the right set of optimizations to significantly speed up the mobile Web.<br/><br/>The problem is that the mobile Web ecosystem is fairly complex. This makes understanding the page load bottlenecks and analyzing optimizations challenging. Second, the time it takes to load a page depends on various factors. Isolating the effect of an optimization under such variability is non-trivial. To address these challenges, the project proposes two key ideas: (1) Piecemeal analysis: Web page loading is not an atomic activity. The page load process is made up of several smaller activities that form a complex dependency structure. The project proposes to decompose the Web page process and analyze each sub activity to identify the bottlenecks. Further, the effect of an optimization will be studied on each of these sub activities. This piecemeal analysis addresses the complexity challenge in the Web ecosystem, and (2) Isolation: The project proposes to develop techniques and experimental tools to control the variability of the page load process. The goal is to isolate the effect of a given optimization by forcing the effect of other unrelated parameters to be a near constant. The techniques developed in this project will be more broadly applicable to studying other mobile applications such as video."

This convection drives plate tectonics, generating major societal hazards (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, etc.) and controls the compositional and thermal evolution of the planet. Since the early 1960s, quantifying the deformation properties of mantle rocks has been a major goal in experimental Earth Sciences. Advancement has been limited by technology, owing to serious difficulties in conducting experiments involving deformation of minerals at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth's deep interior.  The upper-mantle (top 410 km) consists of peridotites, rocks comprised dominantly of olivine, i.e., the semi-precious gem known as peridot. In the transition zone (410-670 km depth) at pressure in excess of 140,000 atm, olivine is no longer stable and transforms into high-pressure minerals, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, which have comparable compositions but denser structures.  Decades of experimental work have provided strong constraints on olivine plasticity, yet little is known about the viscosity of minerals in the transition-zone. The aim of the present project is to provide accurate computational models for the viscosity of Earth's transition zone, which will integrate new experimental data on wadsleyite and ringwoodite obtained in state-of-the art high-pressure deformation devices set at synchrotron facilities. These experiments, involving newly developed devices and analytical techniques, are at the forefront of research on the mechanical behavior of materials at high pressure. Besides advancing our understanding of mantle convection, this program will provide support and training in modern experimental science to one graduate student as well as undergraduate students. All the new experimental and analytical tools will become available to other scientists, advancing our general knowledge in high-pressure research. The team's results will find direct applications in Geophysics and Seismology, and broader applications in Materials Science. <br/><br/>Flow laws for Earth materials provide vital constraints on mantle dynamics, while knowledge of deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale provides insights into crucial observables such as seismic anisotropy. The complexity of the stress field within deforming rocks, which varies from grain to grain as plastic properties are anisotropic, can now be observed in situ using new high-pressure devices coupled with X-ray synchrotron radiation, and addressed by self-consistent mean-field modeling. In this project, the investigators will take advantage of these recent developments to address the plasticity of the transition zone. Specifically, they will study the flow properties of wadsleyite and ringwoodite as a function of iron and water contents, and constrain strength contrasts with olivine, using the Deformation-DIA apparatus and the newly developed D-TCup and DT-25.  In situ X-ray radiography and diffraction will be used to measure strain, stress and texture (i.e., lattice preferred orientation).  The new flow laws will be integrated into models for the effective viscosity and seismic anisotropy of the transition-zone. Modeling efforts will benefit from the second-order (SO) method, a recent improvement in mean-field schemes which describes accurately highly non-Newtonian materials, such as silicates. The models will account for stress-field heterogeneities due to crystal orientations, complex deformations mechanisms (dislocation glide and diffusion), incorporate several minerals, and improve confidence for extrapolation of results to geologic strain rates. The model construction will be flexible, allowing integration of additional phases and flow law parameters as they become available in the future. The outcome will give crucial insights on transition-zone viscosity, and the crystal preferred orientations that produce seismic anisotropy."

The investigators will use experiments encompassing current and projected temperature and carbon-dioxide conditions, will determine the roles of each variable and their interaction on traits that affect the fitness of both copepod species. They will also determine which life stages are most sensitive to individual or simultaneous stress conditions. Through multigenerational selection experiments, the investigators will identify and characterize the mechanisms of copepod evolutionary adaptation. Finally, they will measure genomic changes across the generations under all four experimental conditions to quantify the relative contributions of genetic and maternally-induced change in the physiological and life history traits of copepods in response to near-future climate conditions."

In this project, the research team combines advanced growth and characterization techniques with first-principles calculations to investigate FMSs based on transition-metal chalcogenides. The goal is to elucidate the mechanism by which charge carriers mediate or induce coupling between localized magnetic substructures embedded in the same crystal lattice in order to achieve exotic combinations of properties such as large magnetic moments, large coercivity, high Curie temperature and high electrical conductivity within a single material. Such a result would significantly advance our knowledge about the nature of coupling between electronic properties and magnetism, which is of tremendous importance to further expansion of research on spintronic materials."

Ecological theory predicts that the superior competitor should drive inferior competitors to local extinction (i.e. the best fighter wins!)  Yet, plant communities contain many species with varying competitive abilities, so a central question in ecology is: How do competing species coexist in nature?  For example, co-occurring plant species differ dramatically in seed size, and larger seeded species are often better competitors and also sometimes better at tolerating stressful conditions than smaller seeded species.  Given these inequalities, how is seed size variation maintained? A leading theory is that small-seeded species have better dispersal abilities than large-seeded species, enabling them to reach local sites where large-seeded species are absent.  This theory, however, ignores the fact that large-seeded species often have substantially more of their seeds eaten by rodents than do small-seeded species.  Thus, this research will experimentally test the novel idea that large and small-seeded species coexist because rodent seed predators preferentially feed on large seeded species, thereby countering the imbalance in competitive ability among these species based on their seed size.  This research will generate a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that promote coexistence and a fuller appreciation for the ecological forces that determine the relative abundance and diversity of species in communities.  This work will also be used to increase public understanding of grassland ecology and enhance knowledge of how plant communities are organized, which is essential for effectively managing these habitats. <br/><br/>Seed size and number have long been considered central to coexistence strategies, yet empirical evidence showing how these traits are shaped by specific coexistence mechanisms remains scarce. Within sites, seeds of 18 co-occurring forb species (9 small-seeded, 9 large-seeded) will be added to plots with and without resident bunchgrass competitors to test how species vary in competitive tolerance.  Across 12 sites that vary in productivity and other abiotic factors, seeds of the same focal species will be added to plots at different densities where competition from resident dominant bunchgrasses and rodent seed predation are manipulated. This will allow an evaluation of how competition, seed predation, and ability to handle stressful abiotic conditions influences recruitment functions of species with different seed sizes.  It will also enable an exploration of whether seed size is part of a suite of correlated traits that form ""syndromes"" that predict demographic performance under distinct biotic and/or abiotic conditions."

Some evidence suggests that the balance among these processes may have been fundamentally altered by high acid deposition (""acid rain"") in the eastern United States during the post-Industrial Revolution period.  During this period it is hypothesized that acid deposition decreased nutrients in the soil such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. This may have required trees to pump more water from the soil through their systems to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients, causing a subsequent loss of water flowing in streams.  With the decline in acid deposition over the last 20-30 years, forests soils are able to retain more nutrients. This may reduce the amount of water that trees need to pump through their systems. Thus while maintaining the same rate of growth, trees may release less water to the atmosphere, improving their water use efficiency and leaving more water to feed into streams.

Earlier studies of culture contact, migration, and political expansion have exaggerated the diffusion of cultural practices from a dominant core polity to its peripheral settlements. However, this emphasis on the core overlooks the experiences of local communities in culture contact situations, and the implications these interactions have on identity and everyday life. Dr. Gregory D. Wilson and Christina M. Friberg of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) will conduct archaeological research to evaluate how and why the complex Mississippian society of Cahokia (A.D. 1050-1375) extended its influence over the North American midcontinent and how the process of ""Mississippianization"" unfolded in the Lower Illinois River Valley (LIRV) of west-central Illinois. This research will highlight the complex process of culture contact whereby local peoples do not passively adopt the practices of a more powerful core polity, but engage, or resist engagement, in reference to their own identities. The project will also provide educational opportunities, and hands-on experience in both fieldwork and lab work, to undergraduate students, training them in the practical skills necessary to pursue a career in archaeology. Results will be shared with the scientific community through publication, and with local communities through public talks addressing the prehistory of their hometowns while stressing the importance of context and the scientific method in archaeology, as a means to discourage the widespread practice of looting.<br/><br/>Cahokia, near modern-day St. Louis, Missouri, was the largest PreColumbian city in North America and its inhabitants spread aspects of Mississippian culture as far north as northwest Wisconsin. However, little is understood about how Cahokians initiated these distant interactions, and how and why local groups participated in them. Settlements in Cahokia's American Bottom region of southwestern Illinois show evidence of direct political and economic ties with the paramount center of Cahokia. Archaeological research farther north has also shown that the inhabitants of frontier settlements selectively adopted certain aspects of a Mississippian way of life, while maintaining a number of their existing traditions. An analysis of craft production and exchange, subsistence patterns, and community organization at the Audrey North Site in the LIRV will add valuable insight to archaeologists' understanding of the Mississippian phenomenon in Cahokia's immediate periphery. The proximity of the LIRV to Cahokia likely facilitated regular interaction between the two regions, enabling certain social, political, and economic interactions with American Bottom groups that did not transpire with more distant groups. Using magnetic gradiometry data as a starting point, excavation should reveal evidence of the production and exchange of economically important Cahokian crafts. Bayesian statistical analysis of Radiocarbon assays will establish a timeline for the Mississippianization process in the LIRV. Finally, additional analysis of everyday practices such as food processing and storage and community organization will shed light on the degree to which local LIRV people incorporated Cahokian practices and/or maintained traditions with reference to their existing understanding of world order."

The classical theory of these operators was designed to work on smooth functions. However, nature often provides us with very irregular media with which to engage. This creates the need for a very low-regularity form of the theory of singular integrals, which the principal investigators on this project have constructed. A consequence of the low-regularity theory is that through the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a Euclidean space of a very high dimension, one can sometimes conclude that the set itself is of a much lower dimension than the ambient space, an important piece of information from the perspective of data science. To refine this approach to data analysis is one of the main goals of this project. <br/><br/>This project considers several problems in nonhomogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme uniting the problems is the behavior of singular operators with very good (Calderon-Zygmund) kernels in very bad environments (e.g., on sets with no a priori structure, in spaces with matrix weights). Specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) the David-Semmes problem to characterize the rectifiability of sets and measures in high-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the boundedness of the corresponding Riesz transforms; (2) the geometry of reflection-less measures; (3) the geometric characterization of higher-dimensional analogues of positive analytic capacity; (4) two-weight estimates for very simple singular operators in the non-Hilbert setting; and (5) sharp estimates for classical operators with matrix weights. Singular integral operators with respect to bad measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the reasons for their increasing interest in recent years has been the study of analytic capacity. While the theory for the two-dimensional case (i.e., the Cauchy transform on the complex plane) and the theory of analytic capacity that emerged as its by-product are now very well understood, the analogous theory in higher dimensions has not been fully developed. The main roadblock here is the lack of geometric tools in higher dimensions. Additionally, in higher dimensions, nonhomogeneous situations arise more often than in the plane and more often one might expect. For example, boundary value problems in (otherwise smooth) domains with cusps lead to nonhomogeneous problems, because, unlike what happens in the two-dimensional setting, surface measure on the boundary of such a domain is non-doubling. This becomes an even more vexing problem if one wants to consider harmonic measure estimates for domains on whose boundaries ""surface measure"" is practically arbitrary. This is an important issue that the project seeks to confront."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

The simplicity and intrinsic beauty of these problems, and the disproportionate depth and effort of their resolution, has inspired their study since ancient Greece. The central questions that arise naturally stratify as follows: Qualitative questions: Does there exist a solution?  Do there exist infinitely many solutions? Does the set of solutions have some extra structure (e.g. geometric)? Quantitative questions: How many solutions are there? How large is the smallest solution? How can we explicitly and with certainty find all solutions? Implicit questions: Why do equations have (or fail to have) solutions?  Why do some have many and some have none?

Linguists do this by comparing a set of languages along various dimensions, such as words or language structures that may have a common origin.  Documentation of a language plays a key role in how scholars reconstruct the family relationships between languages, but when the documentation exists in archives, in ""analog"" forms, like handwritten field notes or cassette recordings, this creates challenges in doing  reconstruction of family relationships.  This project will address this challenge focusing on three underdocumented languages, whose archival materials have received little attention in the linguistic literature. The research team will digitize materials, and then process and analyze them by creating a database of the three languages.  This research infrastructure will create digital access to the materials and will create a lexicon of use to both linguistic science and to learners.  Tututni, Coquille and Galice, the focus of this project, are three severely endangered Native American languages of the Oregon Coast. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the lexicon to Native communities and the scholarly community, and the education and training of three budding Native social scientists, broadening participation in the linguistics by underrepresented groups. <br/><br/><br/>The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages.  The Athabaskan language family includes many languages and has an expansive geographic distribution, ranging from Alaska and the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada and to the southwest including Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma. Southwest Oregon Athabaskan language communities were extremely fragmented following the forced relocation of members to reservations during the 1850s-60s, termination of tribes in the 1950s and boarding school language policies. However, Tututni, Coquille and Galice have extensive documentation, most of which neither easily accessible nor linguistically analyzed, a gap in the scientific understanding of an important branch of Athabaskan languages. By digitizing and databasing this archival documentation, this project will increase the linguistic understanding of relationships in the Athabaskan family. Methods include the linguistic analysis of verbs, notoriously complex in this language family, and transcription of legacy recordings.  These materials, collected between the 1880s and 1980s, will be analyzed and synthesized into a single database. Scientific hypotheses can be tested against the large bodies of research to yield new discoveries and explanations for Athabaskan languages and their family relationships, especially those of the Pacific Coast branch. Results will also promote language use in Oregon Athabaskan communities and advance education of diverse groups, as these Native citizen scientists engage with the lexicon and the disseminated resources in a host of initiatives, including language and cultural revitalization."

Animal form is marvelously varied. This study addresses the question: what are the developmental mechanisms that produce such diversity? Snails have long been a model system for studying biological form. They have diverse shapes but are easy to measure due to their mathematically regular coiling and have been a major study group since Charles Darwin's famous voyage around the world. Darwin's approach to the study of animal form included investigations of patterns of change in the snail-rich fossil record (paleontology). Modern developmental biology uses molecular tools to understand how genes determine snail form. This project will determine the genetic and environmental interactions that may underlie a conspicuous pattern in paleontology, the repeated evolution of non-coiled shells from coiled ancestors. The researchers will combine computer imaging technology, genetic manipulation and paleontology to provide unparalleled precision in determining how both genes and their environment shape an organism through time. Broader societal impacts will result from this work due in part to the design and implementation of a workshop on visual literacy. This workshop will improve the ability of the researchers and the scientific community to understand and convey complex visual information to the public. The workshop materials will be posted online for increased access. <br/><br/>This project investigates the developmental basis of snail shell morphology and the transition from coiled to non-coiled shells in the emerging model system, the Common Slipper Shell (Crepidula fornicata). Specifically, it evaluates the hypothesis that simple modification in signaling patterns in a protein named decapentaplegic could be the basis for a pattern of non-coiled shell evolution. Other shell developmental genes also will be evaluated for the ability to affect shell patterning more generally. Genetic pathways influenced by changes in shell coiling will be manipulated in developing animals to isolate their individual effects on morphology. Detailed morphological data is required for this work. Scanning electron microscopy will be used to visualize the process of torsion and to assess morphological changes across the entire embryo in response to genetic perturbations. Computed tomography (CT scanning) will enable the use of 3-dimensional shape analysis of embryo and shell form with enhanced precision. The use of these computer-assisted technologies combined with molecular techniques will allow new insight into how paleontological patterns are formed."

The second thrust is using ultrafast X-ray absorption and Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to directly monitor the charge distribution around the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms.  The equilibrium X-ray experiments are being conducted at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and the ultrafast RIXS experiments are conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).

This idea is being tested by investigating the catalytic properties of the complexes in the electrophilic activation of alkynes.  Altogether, this research program helps to validate the notion that ligands combining a phosphine with an antimony center can be used for the construction of novel redox-responsive catalysts.  In addition to contributing to the education of a diverse group of students, this project allows the principle investigator to maintain his involvement in various service and outreach activities involving K-6 students.<br/><br/>A series of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic ligands containing phosphines as &#963;-donors and an antimony atom as a &#963;-acceptor are investigated with the ultimate goal of understanding whether the redox state of the antimony atom can be used to modulate the Lewis acidity and catalytic properties of the gold center.  This idea is being tested by studying gold complexes featuring mono(phosphino)antimony and bis(phosphino)antimony ligands.  For both type of complexes, oxidation of the antimony atom from the +III to the +V state is expected to activate the gold center and enhance its affinity for Lewis basic substrates including alkynes. The mono(phosphino)antimony derivatives is designed such that activation occurs by abstraction of a gold-bound halide ligand by the neighboring Lewis acidic antimony center.  Activation of the complexes featuring a bis(phosphino)antimony ligand is expected to occur through formation of a direct Au&#8594;Sb interaction.  For both families of complexes, the extent of activation experienced by the gold center is derived from an experimental determination of its Lewis acidity, as well as from its ability to catalyze reactions involving alkynes.  At the heart of this project lies the fundamental notion that the redox state of antimony ligands can be manipulated as a means to adjust the reactivity of a transition metal center held in proximity by ancillary ligands. These fundamental advances may prove transformative in the area of redox-responsive ligands, with applications in sensing and catalysis. Another important outcome of this project is the involvement and education of a diverse group of students.  The educational plan also includes outreach to students enrolled in Spanish/English K-6 dual language classes at local elementary and intermediate schools."

Unfortunately, synthetic approaches to create large scale materials that encompass both the complexity and hierarchical features found in natural materials are still lacking. The objective of this award is to develop the fundamental understanding necessary for the creation of a method to fabricate multiscale colloidal nanomaterials.

The development of assembly processes to produce colloidal nanomaterials is useful for any application that aims to manipulate electromagnetic radiation, for example, sensors and solar cells, and more exotic emerging applications like optical computing and optical cloaking. Outreach efforts include engagement and participation of high school and undergraduate students in the laboratory. Students participating in the project will be encouraged to present at conferences and be involved with additional outreach efforts at local elementary schools.<br/><br/>The hierarchical colloidal materials nanomanufacturing project is based on combining strong and weak interactions towards a processing method that continuously assembles nanoparticle structures over a large area. This approach relies on coupling hydrodynamics and capillary interactions for rapid transport and organization of nanoparticle-loaded droplets on predefined patterned surfaces, balancing bulk convection and local diffusion-mediated assembly of nanoparticle microstructures via field-mediated interactions, and rapidly arresting or immobilizing structures through polymerizable media to quench nanoparticle configurations. Individually, these steps can be met with existing technologies, but combining them brings significant engineering and scientific challenges. For example, it is necessary to orchestrate the disparate time- and length-scales associated with diffusive, capillary, and hydrodynamic transport to enable multiscale structure formation in a single step. Given the imperfect separation between the scales at which these processes operate, understanding of how to control interactions in regimes where they compete and/or are coupled will be accomplished via optical microscopy, and simulations."

Micrometeorological measurements suggest that forest WUE has dramatically increased over the last two decades, in excess of what would be expected from increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Coinciding with observed trends in forest WUE have been marked decreases in acid deposition throughout much of North America and Europe. There is evidence that acid deposition may impact forest WUE, either by altering the availability of nutrients in forest soils or by directly affecting foliar physiology.  Changes in WUE could also lead to changes in stream discharge from forested catchments.  The hypothesized response of forests to changing levels of acid deposition is not currently considered in the land surface components of global climate models (GCMs). Since carbon dioxide and water vapor are the two most important greenhouse gases, it is vital to accurately model their land-atmosphere exchange.<br/> <br/>The proposed research uses a catchment-based approach to investigate the effects of changing acid deposition on forest WUE. Tree ring carbon isotopes will be used to reconstruct historical WUE time series within six catchments that have been differentially impacted by acid deposition due to distinctions between their underlying bedrock mineralogy and geological histories. The research will also capitalize on experimental treatments that have altered soil biogeochemistry in paired catchment designs (Bear Brook, ME; Hubbard Brook, NH; and Fernow Experimental Forest, WV). Stream discharge analysis and model-based approaches will be applied to detect the impact of acid deposition on forest WUE. <br/><br/>The project will support a Ph.D. student, who will receive training in a wide range of field, laboratory, and modeling techniques, and at least eight undergraduate students.

Real world and engineering networks often have tens of thousands of components. Theory, developed by the principal investigator, allows one to compress networks of any type into much smaller networks while preserving important information about the initial large network.  In the proposed project, this theory will be further developed.  And, in collaboration with Center for Disease Control (CDC) researchers, applied to an analysis of transmission and cross-immunoreactivity networks for Hepatitis C.  Cross-immunoreactivity means that antibodies produced by the immune system to fight some specific type of viruses sometimes fights other types of viruses as well.  Cross-immunoreactivity is found for Hepatitis C, influenza, dengue, and is a basis for a mathematical model developed by the author with CDC colleagues.  Traditional views on evolution of systems with complex dynamics suggest that only long term predictions for such systems are possible, since one should wait until the system stabilizes.  A new approach, proposed by the principal investigator, allows one to make short term predictions on the evolution of chaotic systems.  It will be possible to answer questions such as, ""which state of the system is most likely?"".  This research will extend this approach to a larger class of systems with complex dynamics and also address problem of recurrence.  Understanding of a fundamental mechanism of chaos, called defocusing, will be essentially extended. Discovery of this mechanism by the principal investigator has already found numerous applications in theoretical and experimental physics. New visual models of systems with various types of chaotic behavior can be included into basic and advanced courses on complex systems and chaos.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses some long standing and technically challenging, as well as new natural problems, in the theory of dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. A new area of finite time qualitative properties of dynamical and stochastic systems, pioneered by the principal investigator, will be further developed.  This will make use of combinations of methods and ideas of symbolic dynamics, discrete mathematics and probability.  The theory of isospectral transformation of networks will be further developed with a special emphasis on analysis of attractors of sequences of such transformations in the space of networks.  Understanding the mechanism of defocusing, a fundamental mechanism of hyperbolicity (chaos), will be advanced.  This uses new classes of chaotic billiards where focusing components are not forced to be far from each other.   Classical Ehrenfests' gas will be shown to have unexpected properties thanks to a new observation that billiards with a point and with a finite size particle can have quite different dynamics."

Typically, the analysis of such data sets begins by modeling the data as a high dimensional system, and so an understanding of the behavior of such systems (and techniques for dealing with them) has become equally important. This award supports a mathematical investigation of the behavior of such systems using techniques introduced by the researcher in previous work with collaborators. These techniques have led to the resolution of a number of open problems across various mathematical fields, including the Kadison-Singer problem and the existence of Ramanujan graphs of all sizes and degrees. This project aims to further develop substantial connections with research across numerous fields of science, including convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, functional analysis, combinatorics, and probability. The award also supports plans to focus interdisciplinary activities of particular benefit to students associated with the project.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the project focuses on two areas of research: (A) to develop a theory of ''finite free probability,'' a collection of ideas lying in the intersection of random matrix theory, convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, and polynomial geometry, and (B) to generalize the previously mentioned techniques so as to widen their potential application. This includes extending the ideas to bivariate polynomials as well as a non-Hermitian setting. In the direction of (B), the project aims to address some of the obstacles that hinder the application of the current techniques (for example, the need for real rootedness of associated polynomials) by investigating analogous behaviors in more general settings. This would be a necessary part of extending (A) to non-Hermitian settings, for example, as such objects no longer satisfy the conditions necessary to apply the current techniques. Extensions in this direction would also open the possibility of application to new areas such as quantitative geometry."

Much is known about the effects of illness on worker absenteeism and disability, but little is known about the effects of disease vulnerability on decision making, which can play a key role in quality of life and the nation's economic growth. This research examines the link between disease vulnerability due to immunological functioning or the environmental context and decision making with a series of studies. This research is based in a novel integration of theory and methods from several fields including psychoneuroimmunology, experimental social psychology, and evolutionary biology. It is easy to imagine that given a disease vulnerability one would engage in self-protective decisions and behaviors. However, by combining these theories the scientists arrive at an innovative and counterintuitive prediction. That is, instead of moving us toward safe decisions, vulnerability to disease that stems from environmental and immunological sources may actually lead to risky decisions. The findings of this research could be used to promote the physical health of our citizens, benefiting their well-being and our nation's economy.<br/>      <br/>The proposed research will test the hypothesis that greater vulnerability to pathogens and disease increase risky decision making. The research tests decision making in the context of biologically derived, immune-based vulnerabilities or perceived changes in the external pathogen load. To test the link between vulnerability and risky decisions, Dr. Sarah Hill, from Texas Christian University, and her colleagues, propose a multi-disciplinary correlational study that measures the relationship between multiple facets of peripheral blood-based immune function and decision-making. This first-of-its kind study will provide important new insights into whether key measures of immunological function predict risk-taking and its attitudinal and cognitive antecedents. Next, the researchers propose seven laboratory experiments in which they use an established priming procedure to experimentally induce perceived vulnerability to disease, and measure subsequent psychological and behavioral changes known to promote risky decision-making. The proposed research promises to offer important new theoretical advances to numerous fields including social, health, evolutionary, clinical, and personality psychology, decision making science, and psychoneuroimmunology. This research will yield important new insights into factors that promote a variety of risky decisions that lead to risk-taking behaviors among those people who are most vulnerable to the ill effects of these behaviors."

Their biggest liability is the toxicity that comes from the presence of lead.  With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the proposed research aims to discover and develop halide double perovskites, an emerging class of semiconductors that possess many of the favorable characteristics of the lead halide perovskites, but without the presence of toxic elements like lead.  In this way the research aims to dramatically increase the feasibility and sustainability of halide perovskites for technological applications.     <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>New materials will be found via computationally guided exploratory synthesis.

Growth of single crystals and thin films will provide a fundamental understanding of the carrier mobilities, lifetimes, and diffusion lengths in this class of materials. By finding materials with appropriate band gaps materials will be developed that can compete with the lead halide perovskites for use in solar cells and other applications including quantum dots, scintillators, and transparent conductors."

It happens to be useful and natural to make ""time"" itself more abstract and replace it with any other discrete system of symmetries, say of some object (such symmetries form what is a called a discrete group). In the case of a very chaotic physical system, one cannot effectively predict its future state. This fact gives rise to an important quantity, the entropy of the system, that measures how unpredictable it is. Entropy was originally defined directly within an information theoretic context, but it turns out that, if one views it instead from the perspective of a statistical mechanics formalism, the scope of entropy theory is increased to encompass a very large class of groups known as ""sofic groups."" Seen through this new lens, entropy becomes a measurement of how many finitary approximations the physical system has. The general question of how well an infinitary process can be approximated by a finitary one is a fundamental question of scientific inquiry, and the class of sofic groups includes many natural examples coming from geometry and number theory. This project also sheds light on the connection to physics that is inherent in its statistical mechanical and information theoretic origins. Moreover, the subject has proven to have interesting links to diverse areas of mathematics, including the following: functional analysis, ergodic theory, combinatorics, and operator algebras. Many of the links are direct consequences of the principal investigator's research.  The project is part of ongoing activity to strengthen and understand such connections.<br/><br/>This project revolves around three main problems. The first is to understand the orbit equivalence consequences of positive or complete positive entropy for actions of nonamenable groups. For example, the principal investigator has shown that actions with complete positive entropy are strongly ergodic and that positive entropy actions are not weakly compact. He seeks to prove that actions with compete positive entropy are solidly ergodic, as defined by Chifan and Ioana, which will give further indication of the Bernoulli-like behavior that these actions exhibit. Part of the interest in this objective is that it places the theory of entropy for actions of nonamenable groups in stark contrast to the study of entropy for actions of amenable groups, where it is impossible to derive any orbit equivalence consequences of entropy. These consequences of complete positive entropy apply to algebraic actions (i.e., actions on compact groups by automorphisms), for the principal investigator can already demonstrate that algebraic actions related to invertible convolution operators have complete positive entropy. A second problem is concerned with investigating the entropy theory of algebraic actions of equivalence relations, which is joint work with Lewis Bowen and Dylan Airey. One aim of this part of the project is to generalize the principal investigator's results on entropy and Fuglede-Kadison determinants from the group case to the equivalence relation case. Lastly, the principal investigator will further the connections between dynamics and operator algebras by defining sofic entropy for actions on operator algebras."

Plant-sap feeding insects form close partnerships, or symbioses, with bacteria. These partnerships allow the insects to feed on nutrient-poor plant-sap by supplementing their diets. This association is beneficial for both partners and it comes with consequences. One consequence is that the bacteria typically evolve to have extremely small genomes. In many groups of insects these bacterial partnerships are stable over millions of years. This study will test if the genome size of a bacteria is determined by how long the insect and bacteria have coevolved, or if it requires a more complicated explanation involving the host's diet type.  The study will broaden our general understanding of bacterial-insect associations in nature, a topic that may impact agriculture and conservation.  Additionally, this project includes efforts to encourage Native American students to pursue education in the sciences by providing them with hands-on laboratory experiences.<br/><br/>Previous studies have revealed the extreme reductions in the genomes of symbiotic bacteria and the loss of functions in critical nutrient-provisioning pathways. While recent studies have begun to examine the details of mode and tempo of genome degradation in symbionts, important questions remain. How important is selection in driving smaller genome size? How important is the age of the symbiotic associations? Do the particular metabolic or ecological roles of the symbionts influence the change in genome size? Progress has been made, but studies have been constrained by the fact that these factors are hard to disentangle. This research introduces a novel system that removes several confounding factors to allow a clearer view of what causes decreased genome size in symbionts. The genomes of symbionts will be compared in closely related lineages of adelgid insects that share a common symbiont but differ in the nutrients available through host diet. This will allow the influence of host diet nutrient content to be examined while controlling for the age of the symbiosis. A number of symbiont genomes from within and across adelgid lineages will also be sequenced for a more general survey of the causes of symbiont genome decay. Gene deletions in all core metabolic categories, particularly nutritional provisioning will be quantified. Patterns of genome decay will then be analyzed to detect correlation between decay and age of the association, nutritional role and other factors."

Students will develop strong research skills as well as become effective communicators, both orally and in writing.  Summer activities will include renowned guest speakers and other programming on a wide variety of topics to enhance students' professional development and curiosity.

Further, the faculty themselves will be mentored by previous REU advisors, with a particular focus on the faculty who have limited experience in leading undergraduate research; this mentoring will run year-round. Thus, both students and faculty will grow through the REU, and they will return to their home institutions energized by the experience and ready to continue conducting research.  <br/><br/>A diverse selection of research projects will be offered, appropriate for a combination of rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors each year and targeting a wide range of prior mathematical and statistical training. Students early in their mathematical education can engage in research on roughly half of the projects, including those focusing on permutation patterns and statistics, geometric network optimization, and block coloring problems. Other projects include research on symmetries in affine geometry, infinite groups and cube complexes, and the Kelly Criterion for investments.

This research project investigates the interrelations between the commutative and noncommutative settings, and the possible ways to study the latter via geometry and combinatorics.

One direction of this program is the description of the automorphism groups and invariants, such as discriminants, of noncommutative algebras via Poisson geometry and cluster algebras. Another direction targets the study of the properties of Nichols algebras and quantum groups by realizing them as cluster algebras. The geometric and combinatorial approaches will be merged in the investigation of the topology of the spectra of quantum function algebras. Noncommutative projective spaces and Calabi-Yau algebras will be studied using techniques from cluster algebras. In the reverse direction, these connections will be used to investigate homological and Poisson geometric properties of cluster algebras."

Electron transfer reactions are the simplest chemical reactions but have central roles in biological systems and in human-engineered devices that seek to harness solar energy as alternative sources.  The initial stages of plant photosynthesis are exquisitely engineered to transfer electrons across large distances, wasting as little energy as possible, in order to make high-energy molecules for later use.   The mitochondria in the cells of animals use an analogous ""reverse"" electron transfer pathway to synthesize molecules that allow muscle movement from high-energy precursors.   As we seek to mimic the effectiveness of plants in harnessing solar energy it is critical to understand electron transfer processes at a detailed level.  The rate of electron transfer depends on many quantities, but the factor that controls the distance- and orientation-dependence of the rate is called the ""electronic coupling element"", a quantity that has the potential to yield unprecedented control of rates if we can understand it at a fundamental level.  Cave and his coworkers   develop new methods for the calculation of the electronic coupling that are more accurate than existing approaches.  The new methods and results are used to better design new synthetic solar energy conversion devices and understand mechanisms of biological electron transfer.  The work is carried out Harvey Mudd College, an undergraduate institution.  The work provides an excellent educational opportunity for students likely to pursue graduate work in chemistry and also supports the annual presentation of a theoretical chemistry workshop to the Society of Women Engineers? On-Campus Day for high school women, where 100-150 high school women are introduced to opportunities in science, engineering and mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>Great strides have been made over the past two decades in developing diabatization techniques for extracting the electronic coupling from standard quantum chemical approaches.  However, because of the poor scaling of correlated quantum chemistry methods with system size one is often faced with the choice between accuracy and tractability, especially for large electron transfer systems.  Given the success of these diabatization methods, it is imperative to turn attention to developing new electronic structure theory approaches, tailored to the electron transfer problem, which are accurate and able to treat considerably larger systems.  This work addresses this challenge by developing a series of approximate methods that include correlation in a balanced fashion for all of the zeroth-order states relevant to the electron transfer process.  These approaches greatly extend the size of electron transfer systems for which the coupling can be obtained accurately and thus provide useful guidance about the suitability of more approximate methods.   In particular a family of correlated methods is developed to calculate the electronic coupling element based on approximations to the Equation of Motion Coupled Cluster approach.   The methods scale no worse than MP2/MBPT2, giving access to dramatically larger systems than available to CI or CCSD.  Use of PT-based coefficients in place of CCSD coefficients in the similarity transformed Hamiltonian, coupled with truncated excitation spaces tailored to electron transfer systems, lead to the increased scope and speed.  Tests of these new methods include a series of model systems where high-accuracy calculations can also be performed, application to calculate the electronic coupling in near-degenerate donor/acceptor and bridge systems, and the study of through-solvent electron transfer.  Both of the latter two computational targets have been studied experimentally."

Of particular interest is the application of measurement science to polymer-based additive manufacturing. Invited speakers will make presentations regarding the current state of polymer-based AM and existing roadmapping efforts. Breakout sessions will then take place to extract the research needs and future directions of polymer-based additive manufacturing from the participants. The objectives of the workshop are to: (1) review the state-of-the-art in basic research and the existing roadmap in polymer-based additive manufacturing; (2) examine future prospects of polymer-based additive manufacturing and sharing of perspectives on basic research needs; (3) identify  needs, gaps, and challenges, especially as relates to basic research and metrology; and (4) formulate recommendations for basic research initiatives."

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Joseph Kieber.<br/><br/>Cytokinins are plant hormones that are known to regulate various aspects of growth and development and other physiological processes in plants. The overarching goal of the project is to gain a deeper understanding into how cytokinin regulates these processes by using an integrative transcriptomic and genomic approach to build a dynamic model of the cytokinin response in rice. These new insights may provide new effective strategies to engineer this signaling pathway to modify various agronomical traits in rice needed to meet the future food supply and demand. The broader impacts of the project consist of training undergraduate and graduate students, assisting the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center with a series of workshops designed for UNC graduate students, and participating in the North Carolina DNA Day, which is an annual event where North Carolina researchers from various institutions advocate careers in science and biotechnology and give biology lessons to high schools throughout North Carolina. Training objectives include acquiring expertise with new transcriptomic and genomics methods, and bioinformatics tools.<br/><br/>This project seeks to: 1) kinetically characterize the transcriptional and open chromatin profiles using RNA-Seq and formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), respectively, in response to cytokinins in shoots and roots in rice; 2) integrate these datasets, build dynamic models for the cytokinin response, and identify cis-acting regulatory elements by utilizing a variety of bioinformatics tools; and 3) adapt assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) for use in rice and then use this method in conjunction with RNA-Seq to build dynamic tissue-specific cytokinin response models in the shoot and root meristems in rice. These models will be tested and validated in future studies by altering different modules and components to ascertain their specific function in the cytokinin signaling pathway and effects on agronomical traits in rice. The collected sequencing datasets will be made available at the Sequence Read Archive at NCBI."

In this group of mosquitos the number of different species has traditionally been underestimated because, while indistinguishable in appearance, the group is actually comprised of multiple genetically distinct species. Despite their importance to humans little is known about how these species arose. This project addresses three questions in mosquito genetics. First what genes are responsible for reproductive isolation between the species? Second, how do those genes diverge across time leading to speciation? And third is the pattern of change between two species consistent across different pairs of species? Several of these species are the major vectors of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to helping us understand the genetic process that creates biological diversity, this project therefore has additional societal benefits as it may help in the development and implementation of novel genetic vector control measures by, identifying genes causing sterility in mosquitoes.<br/><br/>The name Anopheles gambiae is actually associated with a species complex of eight genetically distinct but recently diverged species that cannot be identified based on morphology. The complex is an important study system for the field of speciation genetics because species in the complex exhibit a wide range of genetic divergence, including partially isolated sub-species. Therefore this species complex allows these researchers to study speciation as it unfolds. When different species of the complex hybridize, the male offspring are sterile and females are fertile. If a hybrid female mates with a male of either parental species, the resulting second-generation hybrids exhibit varying levels of sterility due to genetic incompatibility. This allows genomic mapping of the causes of sterility through sequencing of many backcross offspring. This study will thereby map regions of the genome that cause male and female sterility in backcross hybrids between two species (An. gambiae and An. quadriannulatus). Combined with existing data on male and female sterility in backcross hybrids between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis this data will determine if the same genomic regions cause sterility across different species pairs. By comparing the patterns of divergence and their causes across multiple species pairs the research will increase our understanding of the factors driving speciation in an important group of animals."

One goal of this research is to elucidate feasible mechanistic pathways that explain experimental results.

The work also aims to clarify structure-reactivity relationships, for example, by evaluating how the degree of curvature influences the different mechanisms for Stone-Wales rearrangement. At lower temperatures, pi-bond shifting in annulenes is known to be facile, and the research explores the contribution of quantum mechanical tunneling. The possibility that large numbers of carbon atoms are tunneling simultaneously are explored by comparing classical and quantum tunneling rates. The work addresses the scope of tunneling in organic reactions.

For example, 4He atoms are apparently able to flow though solid 4He as they do through a liquid. Prior work suggested that this behavior indicated a ""supersolid"" state of matter analogous to superfluidity and superconductivity.  This is no longer believed to be the case but the mechanism allowing atoms to flow through the solid remains a mystery.  In this project a different approach to study the flow of atoms will be used. A pressure difference will be applied across the solid by a unique technique that does not employ pushing on the crystal sides.  Using this technique we will study the properties of this fascinating system as a function of flow rate and 3He concentration.  Participating undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate (postdocs) students will gain experience in fundamental physics and cutting-edge technology and be prepared for future work in research, teaching or industrial settings. These investigations may lead to advances in materials science that could have significant technological implications, for example in metallurgy.<br/><br/>****Technical Abstract****<br/><br/>This project is centered on an investigation of a fundamental and important question in Condensed Matter Physics: What is the mechanism by which 4He atoms are apparently able to flow through a sample cell that is filled with solid 4He? Prior work by others initially suggested that there may be a bulk ""supersolid"" state of matter that may exist in solid 4He at very low temperatures. This is an issue that aroused intense interest in the Condensed Matter community, stimulated a number of experiments and theoretical works, and resulted in a number of possible explanations and some substantial paradoxes. The theoretical debate insists that perfect crystals of solid helium cannot be a ""supersolid"", and that any mass flux through the solid must be carried by defects. The experimental approach used in this research is to impose a chemical potential gradient on the solid: for example, by application of a pressure difference to liquid helium that interfaces the solid instead of applying mechanical pressure directly to the 4He crystal lattice; or, the application of a temperature difference to utilize the superfluid Fountain Effect to drive the flow. The approach employs the known behavior of 4He to remain a liquid at elevated pressure in the porous material Vycor (a porous glass), at pressures at which bulk 4He would be a solid. Studies as a function of temperature and pressure (and 3He impurity concentration) provided further evidence for flow of the liquid-solid melting curve. The specific mechanism for this flow will be explored including an exploration of the mechanism by which the presence of 3He dramatically suppresses the flow at a concentration-dependent temperature.  One approach will be to understand how the flow responds when the solid is subjected to calibrated applied stress that deforms the solid.  Another approach will be to increase the sensitivity and explore questions about the possibility of a critical flux and a possible onset of measurable dissipation.  Yet another approach will be to explore the extent to which pressure suppresses mass injection and the growth of the solid in the presence of flow under various conditions.   The students (undergraduate, graduate) and post-graduate (postdocs) involved in these studies will gain experience in fundamental physics and cutting-edge technology. Personnel who leave the group will be poised to contribute to scientific research and technological development in industrial, national laboratory, or academic settings."

Just a year earlier, in 1914, the Indian mathematical genius and autodidact Ramanujan had arrived in England to work with Cambridge mathematician G. H. Hardy. The observations and insights he shared then continue to fascinate the mathematical world, and his personal story has captured the public imagination. In recent years evidence has emerged that the work of Einstein and the work of Ramanujan are related. This research project aims to develop the theory underlying this connection and lay important groundwork for future applications. <br/><br/>The project is dedicated to the development of the theory of harmonic Maass forms and the application of this theory to topics in number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics. Harmonic Maass forms generalize modular forms, and are now recognized as furnishing a theoretical framework for Ramanujan's mock theta functions. Freeman Dyson anticipated a role for the mock theta functions in string theory in 1987, and the currently-developing umbral moonshine theory is producing strong evidence in support of this vision. Building on their earlier work in these areas, the investigators aim to develop algebraic, analytic, and combinatorial tools for harmonic Maass forms that will shed light upon problems such as ranks of elliptic curves, the relationship between monstrous and umbral moonshine, and the consequences of this relationship for physics."

Initially, a single cell divides multiple times to generate an aggregate of 10-20 similar cells. Soon after, the progeny of these precursor cells differentiate and self-organize to form other structures. The remarkable feature of this process is its high level of reproducibility despite a number of sources of stochastic variation. In recent years, experimental interrogation has suggested multiple theories for what might be responsible for this process. It is still unclear, however, what drives organization, and in particular, what is responsible for its robustness. This project takes a joint experimental and modeling approach to address this issue. On the modeling side, a novel computational modeling platform will be developed that incorporates known and hypothesized physical and genetic processes to test their influence individually and jointly on development. On the experimental side, imaging and image analysis will be performed on mouse embryos to inform this model and test its predictions. This framework will be initially developed in relation to mouse development and later extended to determine how known differences between early mouse and human cells influence organization, which evidence suggests is less robust in developing human embryos.<br/><br/>This project will shed new light into how mammalian pre-implantation forms from a single cell. The research will also establish new principles for how the interplay between physical and biochemical regulatory processes leads to development of tissues an organisms of exquisite complexity. A multi-scale and stochastic computational framework to study both mouse and human early embryo development will be developed. In addition, this project will develop new training activities involving graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with an emphasis on promoting quantitative thinking and developing modeling and simulation skills. This training will equip students with computational and system-level approaches needed to investigate complex systems. The activities will take advantage of the strengths of the undergraduate and graduate training programs in computational systems biology at the University of California, Irvine and the strong interdisciplinary training programs and ties with minority serving institutions at Vanderbilt University.

Micrometeorological measurements suggest that forest WUE has dramatically increased over the last two decades, in excess of what would be expected from increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Coinciding with observed trends in forest WUE have been marked decreases in acid deposition throughout much of North America and Europe. There is evidence that acid deposition may impact forest WUE, either by altering the availability of nutrients in forest soils or by directly affecting foliar physiology.  Changes in WUE could also lead to changes in stream discharge from forested catchments.  The hypothesized response of forests to changing levels of acid deposition is not currently considered in the land surface components of global climate models (GCMs). Since carbon dioxide and water vapor are the two most important greenhouse gases, it is vital to accurately model their land-atmosphere exchange.<br/> <br/>The proposed research uses a catchment-based approach to investigate the effects of changing acid deposition on forest WUE. Tree ring carbon isotopes will be used to reconstruct historical WUE time series within six catchments that have been differentially impacted by acid deposition due to distinctions between their underlying bedrock mineralogy and geological histories. The research will also capitalize on experimental treatments that have altered soil biogeochemistry in paired catchment designs (Bear Brook, ME; Hubbard Brook, NH; and Fernow Experimental Forest, WV). Stream discharge analysis and model-based approaches will be applied to detect the impact of acid deposition on forest WUE. <br/><br/>The project will support a Ph.D. student, who will receive training in a wide range of field, laboratory, and modeling techniques, and at least eight undergraduate students.

During the Holocene, forced changes in the TRB have been invoked to explain many observed failures and increases in tropical rainfall. However, the physical processes driving changes in TRB dynamics and their relationship to climate forcings remain unclear.<br/><br/>This award generally aims to evaluate the drivers of Holocene TRB variations by utilizing a wide network of tropical paleo-hydroclimate records and new isotope-enabled model simulations.  This project aims to: (1) evaluate the response of the TRB's distinct components (convergence over ocean and land, and seasonal monsoons) to Holocene climate forcing functions and feedbacks, including biogeophysical feedbacks and interactions with ENSO; and (2) translate changes in the TRB into changes in proxy recorders, including those based on precipitation isotope ratios.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of this project will be achieved through a synthesis of climate proxy records of TRB position and intensity and a series of model experiments with NCAR's isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model (CESM).  Time slices at different stages of the Holocene will provide a climate dynamical context for the synthesized data product. A set of sensitivity experiments will help determine the degree to which biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks and ENSO/TRB (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) interactions influence both isotopic and non-isotopic proxies. A toolkit of emerging proxy system models will be integrated into CESM to compare directly with the network of proxy records. It is expected that this project will help evaluate the forced changes in the TRB projected for the 21st century.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts include upgrading and maintaining the isotopic version of the CESM, enabling the development of a post-doctoral scholar community at the institution, developing discovery-based undergraduate educational experiences, and adding new scientific data and analyses to help improve the understanding of natural climate variability."

Professor Gangli Wang and his group members at Georgia State University develop new analytical methods providing knowledge of early-stage nucleation and subsequent crystal growth at greater time and spatial resolutions than is otherwise possible. High quality single crystals display chemical, physical, and mechanical properties, and have superb performance in practical applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and materials industries. Lack of capable methods to measure and to actively control the crystallization process has been a limit on the advance of fundamental research as well as practical applications. The capability to measure the dynamic process in-situ and thus to actively control crystal formation is expected to establish much-needed high throughput and high efficiency crystallization technology. The broader impacts are demonstrated in that the proposed aims advance the paradigm of crystallization. Students from underrepresented groups and from disadvantageous backgrounds in metro Atlanta gain first-hand knowledge and experiences through the grant activities. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish an electroanalytical methodology combined with optical imaging that enables in-situ monitoring and active controls of single nucleus formation and single crystal growth. Analytical platforms are being developed with optimized nanostructures and surface functionalities to spatially confine the formation and growth of a single nucleus at the earliest stage (molecular assembly) one at a time. The kinetics of a single crystal nucleus formation and growth, governed by local transport of the target molecules around the nucleus, are controlled externally via a programmed potential waveform. Active control of mass transport is another superior advantage over the passive diffusion mechanism adopted in conventional crystallization methods. Because the transport and assembly processes are associated with changes in ionic current signals as well as optical properties, in-situ monitoring and adjustments are performed to tailor the nucleation and growth kinetics of individual events."

Latent heat storage is an approach which can be accomplished using certain kinds of materials, including those known as Phase Change Materials, which have the ability to store energy at near constant temperature. However, most Phase Change Materials have unacceptably low thermal conductivities, and therefore their applications for high power, transient, and large-scale renewable energy systems are significantly limited. This award supports the study of a manufacturing process to synthesize and embed a nanoscale metallic network into phase change materials, taking advantage of the high thermal conductivity of the metallic network, to significantly improve thermal performance of Phase Change Material-based energy storage systems. This new type of Phase Change Materials would impact the renewable energy storage industry and diverse applications such as flexible electronics, electronic cooling, and smart textiles. The knowledge acquired from this project will also contribute to other industries such as medical, automobile, food processing and semiconductor packaging. The integration of fundamental research together with the educational efforts will advance engineering education and promote this new and exciting field of science at the high school senior and college freshmen levels.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to synthesize and study interrelationship among structures, processing and thermal properties of a novel phase change material embedded with a soldered metallic nanowire network. The major issues in nanoparticle-dispersed phase change materials include the settlement during melting-solidification cycling, and high interfacial thermal resistance of particles. The research is focused on fundamental issues in exploiting the new phase change material, such as soldering of nanowire-to-nanowire, nanowire-to-sidewall surface, and interactions between magnetic field and nanowires in phase change material fluids. A combined approach involving both modeling and theoretical analysis, and well-designed sets of experiments will be adopted to understand the relationships between network structure, processing parameters such as magnetic field strength, nanowire loading, spacing and size of magnetic pads, soldering temperature, and the resulting thermal properties of the new phase change material."

The interface between an electrode and an ionic solution is a crucial part of batteries, supercapacitors and other devices. Surrounding ions affect the physical properties of membranes and modify the behavior of proteins and DNA. Understanding the structure and properties of ions at interfaces is crucial to extracting them from water, whether for desalinization, removal of lead, arsenic or radioactive elements from groundwater or wastewater, or increasing the supply or rare earth materials for modern electronics. All these systems and processes would benefit from a better nanoscale view of how ions actually arrange themselves near wet surfaces.  This project uses synchrotron X-rays to look directly at how ions are arranged near wet surfaces, while varying the surface, the ion, the concentration, the temperature, etc. What is learned from this research will help verify or refute theoretical predictions, and may also ultimately help design systems with specific properties for practical applications. This project trains graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment and gives them experience in the use of synchrotron facilities.

For example, charged interfaces sometimes attract more counterions than simple electrostatics would predict (""charge inversion"").  Though hydrophobic (nonpolar) surfaces repel water, they are thought to attract certain ions towards the interface. The effects of ions at interfaces and around macromolecules can be strongly ion-specific, e.g. different lanthanides behave very differently. Such effects are exploited, for example, in liquid-liquid separations processes used to extract lanthanides and actinides from solution, but the origins are not understood. These anomalous behaviors are likely to have structural origins.  X-ray scattering studies of interfaces, where one side of the interface is a solution containing ions, are performed in this project. The goal is to characterize the distributions normal to the interfaces, and also to understand whether and under what conditions the ions order laterally to form condensed interfacial phases with modified properties.

Professor Nataro is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Lafayette College. He is developing new compounds containing phosphine ligands having a metallocene backbone that have interesting catalytic properties. These ligands have received considerable attention in catalytic applications, which are important in the pharmaceutical industry. The goal of this research is to examine how subtle alterations to these ligands impacts the reactivity of compounds containing the ligands. Of particular interest is the metal atom at the center of the metallocene backbone. This metal atom can be altered in a variety of ways that are anticipated to increase the reactivity of the compound. The project is well suited for the education of scientists at the undergraduate level.  Professor Nataro's group has been successful at producing high-quality scientific papers and many of these students go on to obtain advanced degrees in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry.  <br/><br/>Bis(phosphino)metallocenes are ligands that are commonly employed in a variety of catalytic reactions. Compounds of these ligands often behave as significantly superior catalysts and this has been attributed to both the ability of the metallocene backbone to undergo redox reactions and the unique steric constraints imposed upon the ligand by the metallocene backbone. In this project, making changes to both of these aspects of these ligands are being examined further. Oxidation of the metal in the backbone is one method of altering bis(phosphino)metallocene ligands. By removing an electron from the metal of the backbone, the ligand become less electron-donating to a second metal center. In addition, oxidation also causes the distance between the metal of the backbone and the C5 rings to increase, which causes the steric bulk of the ligand to increase. The impact of the changes caused by oxidation of the ligands on the reactivity of compounds containing these ligands is being examined. A second method of altering bis(phosphino)metallocene ligands is to force the metal of the backbone to interact with a second metal center. This interaction is very weak, which should greatly enhance the reactivity of the second metal center. In addition, the interaction greatly distorts the bis(phosphino)metallocene ligand, which increasse the steric needs of the ligand. This project is ideal for training undergraduate students in scientific practices and procedures, which benefit the students in preparing for chemical industry the pursuit of advanced degrees in chemistry."

Programming these multicore processors is a challenging task due to bugs resulting from concurrency and synchronization.  This project is developing new synchronization mechanisms that address three aspects of concurrent systems --- programmability, scalability and fault-tolerance. Programmability refers to the ease of developing concurrent applications. Scalability refers to the performance of the program when the number of threads in the system increase. Fault-tolerance refers to the ability of the system to cope with failure of a thread holding a lock.<br/><br/>Currently, the most prevalent synchronization mechanism is based on monitors with condition variables.  Monitors or lock based systems are hard to use for multi object operations, usually have poor scalability and low tolerance for faults. Lock-free mechanisms may have good scalability and fault-tolerance, but are notoriously hard to write and debug. Software Transactional Memory systems hold most promise for programmability. However, it is difficult to get efficient conditional synchronization in current transactional memory systems. This project is developing new synchronization techniques that address global conditional synchronization aspects of monitor or transactional memory systems. In particular, it is developing scalable mechanisms to detect global or multi object conditions and automatically notify threads  waiting on these conditions.  The only way to simulate this mechanism in current systems is by using a global lock or busy wait which results in a large number of context switches and slower performance. The mechanisms developed in this project will result in more concise and faster programs.<br/><br/>For scalability and fault-tolerance, the project is developing methods that enable asynchronous and parallel execution of certain object methods. Asynchronous execution is carried out by keeping a monitor thread that can execute methods on behalf of threads that make the monitor call. This technique improves cache locality and concurrency. For objects with high-contention, the project is studying methods that enable parallel execution of read operations by keeping read-only copies of objects. However, maintaining copies of every monitor object or creating an additional thread for asynchronous execution is inefficient. The project is developing efficient techniques to determine which objects to replicate at runtime.<br/><br/>The project will result in improving programmer productivity and reducing concurrency errors in development of multicore programs. It will also lead to better understanding of how global conditions in a multithreaded program can be evaluated efficiently. As a result, the concurrent programming systems will become more reliable and faster. In addition, the graduate students supported by the project will be trained in fundamentals of multicore computing."

The work is done by creating small clusters of two or three molecules and studying their physical properties. By grouping only a few molecules at a time, the simplification needed to fully understand the attractive forces is achieved. This work identifies prototypical systems that provide the most useful basic information.

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

The Markoff Diophantine equation arose in Markoff's fundamental work (in 1879) characterizing those irrationals that are badly approximable. The equation arises in several fields of mathematics. Its integer solutions have a tree structure, and investigation of the arithmetic properties of these Markoff numbers (the first of which is associated with the golden ratio, in a sense the most badly approximable irrational number) leads to important questions in graph theory.  This research project investigates the connectivity of graphs related to the Markoff tree.  In addition to its importance for number theory, this investigation has deep connections and applications to, among other topics, the product replacement algorithm (the most prevalent but still poorly understood tool in computational group theory) and expander graphs in computer science.<br/><br/>Investigation of the arithmetic properties of Markoff numbers leads to the question of whether the graphs obtained by the modular reduction of the Markoff tree are connected (strong approximation). Superstrong approximation is the assertion that these graphs are in fact highly connected, that is to say form a family of expanders. The past decade saw a remarkable explosion of activity in the area of superstrong approximation for thin groups (Zariski dense subgroups of infinite index). Much of the research was driven by development of the affine sieve. In the case of thin groups with Levi factor of its Zariski closure semisimple, the strong and superstrong approximation and their applications in affine sieve are by now well-understood. On the other hand, the tori pose particularly difficult problems, both in terms of sparsity of elements in an orbit and their Diophantine properties as well as in terms of strong approximation, which in this case amounts to Artin's primitive root conjecture. This research project will investigate strong and superstrong approximation in a setting that is intermediate in level of difficulty between that of tori and that of thin linear groups, namely, that of nonlinear actions on a surface defined by the Markoff equation as well as in the context of other surfaces of Markoff type. Superstrong approximation results for thin linear groups will play an important role in this investigation, as will techniques and methods related to progress on Lang's conjecture and to the classification of algebraic Painlev VI equations."

In the well-established practice, metallic dental implants, the artificial tooth roots, are directly screwed into the jawbone to support the restorations that resemble a tooth or a group of teeth to replace the missing ones.  Because of its superior corrosion resistance, biocompatibility and osseointegration, commercially pure titanium (Ti) or Ti alloy is mainly used for current dental implants. With proper modifications of the implant surface, a high success rate (90-95%) has been achieved to form the initial connection between bone and implant surface, important to keep the implant in place. However, this connection is not permanent and often fails due to the degradation of surrounding bone and the development of bone cracks as a result of the lack of mechanism to absorb the shock. Clearly, there is a great need to improve the dental implants that can yield better and long-lasting bone integration and keep the surrounding bone healthy. In this regard, this I-Corps team proposes a novel design of Ti alloy dental implants, that will not only yield a better integration with surrounding bone but also encourage the regeneration of vascular and nerve networks to vitalize the bone with sensing capability. This design will serve as a great bridge between pure metallic implants and the future biological tooth by forming the desired tissue/metal hybrid structure.<br/><br/>The team's long-term goal is to develop next-generation dental implants that have the capability of facilitating the recruitment of dental progenitor cells into the implant and stimulating the formation of bone and periodontal tissue in the implants. The immediate goal for this I-Corps Teams project is to identify the unmet clinical needs with current dental implants and understand the potentials of the proposed new segmented-implants that are capable of improving tissue ingrowth throughout the implants with better fixation. To address this, the team's efforts are to: (1) better understand the unmet clinical needs in dental implantation and evaluate the potentials of segmented implants with better tissue fixation and prolonged life, and (2) optimize the fabrication procedures and develop the prototype of novel Ti alloy based-dental implants. It is anticipated that this innovative design of next-generation dental implants can greatly satisfy the clinical need with a large market segment. Meanwhile, this design can also be similarly applied to orthopedic and transcutaneous implants."

Professor Theopold is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Delaware.  He is extending the organometallic chemistry of chromium in previously unexplored directions.  One part of this project aims to explore the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of simple hydrocarbons.  The activation and functionalization of carbon (C)-hydrogen (H) bonds is a significant challenge and offers opportunities for the synthesis of useful organic molecules.  The other part of this project explores the reactivity of chromium alkylidenes in the highest possible oxidation state (VI) of that metal.  Such molecules are rare and their potential for catalytic transformation were unknown prior to this work. Accordingly, the research project is uncovering new catalytic reaction pathways that aid modern synthetic organic chemistry.  The work lies at the interface of inorganic and organic chemistry. Its broad reach is designed to train synthetic chemists at all levels.  Professor Theopold's outreach activities include service as judge for a high school science fair, volunteer work for the Franklin Institute, a science museum in Philadelphia, PA, and the publication of a textbook for General Chemistry courses for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics majors. <br/> <br/>Previous work in the Theopold laboratory has led to the discovery of several unusually stable dinuclear chromium alkyl hydrides of the type LCr(mu-R)(mu-H)CrL, which may be seen as products of the C-H activation of hydrocarbons, and which in turn engage in C-H activation reactions of simple hydrocarbons. One part of the project is to identify synthetic routes for the preparation and structural characterization of a wider range of such compounds.  This study facilitates an examination of their relative stability and reactivity.  The program also includes investigations of the mechanism of their reaction with hydrocarbons, leading to alkyl group exchange. In another extension of chromium chemistry, a rare chromium alkylidene has been prepared and its structure determined.  This project involves the synthesis of alkylidenes of the type (ArN)2Cr(VI)=CHR.  The reactivity of these unusually high-valent compounds has not previously been explored in any detail.  Potential catalytic applications involve olefin metathesis and polymerization.  The synthetic work is augmented by relevant DFT calculations.  Prof. Theopold's research group is diverse and offers educational opportunities to students underrepresented in science fields and students with disabilities."

For centuries, biomechanics research has provided a foundation for developing and testing hypotheses ranging from general governing principles of terrestrial locomotion to specific relationships between form and function of limbs and muscles. However, the vast majority of these studies have been conducted in laboratories on treadmills and tracks that bear little resemblance to the environments in which animals actually live. To truly understand the relationship between an animal's muscular and skeletal anatomy and locomotor performance, it is necessary to understand the mechanical demands of the tasks performed in the animal's natural environment. Understanding these relationships in natural habitats remains an important challenge. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the relationships between anatomy and locomotor performance through a series of experiments aimed at understanding in detail how different muscles contribute to movement tasks. Experiments will reveal how specific features of muscles and skeletons impact the function of particular muscles during locomotion in mechanically challenging natural environments. The outcomes of this research will advance knowledge about the functional roles of individual muscles, a topic that is rare in comparative biomechanics studies, and lay the groundwork for a better understanding of how mechanical energy is transferred through complex musculoskeletal systems. Application of this knowledge can lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other human locomotor enhancement devices.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to elucidate the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and bipedal hopping dynamics in desert environments using desert kangaroo rats (D. deserti) as an animal model. It is generally believed that bipedal hopping has evolved because it provides a locomotor performance advantage (e.g., faster top speed, higher endurance, acceleration capacity) related to exaggerated hind limb morphology; however a specific advantage has not been identified for all hopping species. To achieve the proposed objectives, this study will incorporate analyses of habitat use in the field, gait dynamics in the lab, in-vivo muscle dynamics and detailed computer modeling and simulations. This will be the first study to combine all of these methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and performance. This powerful, integrated approach will be used to pursue two specific research objectives: 1) Quantify the mechanical demands of bipedal hopping on substrates and terrain utilized by D. deserti in their natural environment and, 2) Elucidate the relationship between musculoskeletal morphology and habitat use. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish direct links between locomotor performance under natural conditions and musculoskeletal morphology and muscle function in a way that has not been previously possible. An enhanced understanding of how and why animals hop will advance the fields of evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, and biomechanics, and lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other locomotor enhancement devices. This proposal supports an Educational Plan to develop a field course to provide an opportunity for students to integrate what they have learned about ecology and evolution through research-driven, field-based analyses of habitat use, functional morphology, and behavior. Data for behavior and habitat use from multiple years of this course will provide a broader context for interpreting morphological and biomechanical results."

It will integrate laboratory tests of protein to DNA binding with computer analysis of molecular evolution. Broader impacts include training of a graduate student in the integration of computer and experimental approaches to molecular evolution. Dissemination of techniques in statistical programming through software boot camps and science outreach presentations will also increase the representation of women in inter-disciplinary science.<br/><br/>Transcription is the first step in the expression of any gene and hence is thought by many to be the fundamental step in regulation of the genome. Proper regulation of an organism's genes depends on the correct pairing of thousands of different proteins, called transcription factors, with their respective genes. Understanding how new control pairing occurs without loss of original functions is central to regulation in complex genomes.  Steroid receptors are biologically important transcription factors. They are also an excellent model system for the study of transcriptional control since they consist of two related but functionally divergent groups that differ in the way they bind to specific genes. One group predominantly binds to a major groove of the DNA molecule; the other group binds to both major and minor grooves of DNA. To understand the evolution of DNA binding and recognition in these two groups this research utilizes ancestral sequence reconstruction, along with functional laboratory assays. Computational analysis of receptor function and evolution will be combined with laboratory protein binding assays to explore the hypothesis that the shape of the DNA minor groove as well as the DNA sequence was important in the evolution of novel specificity. The proposed experiments will delineate the genetic and physical mechanisms by which different modes of DNA recognition diversified in this group of molecules."

The research aims to use sophisticated modern methods in algebraic geometry and number theory to produce general bounds on the number of solutions to certain Diophantine equations.  The study of Diophantine equations involves finding whole number solutions to polynomial equalities, such as when the sum of two fifth powers is again a fifth power. The study of such equations dates back almost 2,000 years and is among the most difficult problems in all of mathematics, as evidenced by the fact that it was established only 45 years ago that it is not possible to devise a general process with a finite number of operations that can decide whether a Diophantine equation has a solution.  The bounds under development in this research project, which depend only on the degree of the equation (i.e., the size of the exponents), will advance knowledge in this fundamental area of mathematics. The project also involves a middle- and high-school enrichment program, in addition to support for undergraduate and graduate education. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigator seeks to use p-adic analysis and the Chabauty-Coleman method, along with ideas from tropical and non-Archimedean geometry, to give uniform bounds (in terms of the genus) on the number of rational points on hyperbolic curves satisfying certain conditions, refining earlier results. These conditions generally involve a constraint on the Mordell-Weil rank. Using related methods, he will also attempt to prove the uniform Manin--Mumford conjecture, which gives a uniform bound (again in terms of the genus) on the size of a torsion packet on a hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Ideally this result would be unconditional; as a first step, the principal investigator will treat Mumford curves and curves with compact-type reduction."

However, research indicates instead that mathematics ability is malleable, that it can be improved with effort and persistence, a belief system known as ""growth mindset"". There has been much attention to enhancing children's mathematics learning in the classroom. Although this is critical, it does not take into account that children spend a large proportion of their time outside of school, frequently with at least one of their parents. Consequently, parents are an important but underutilized resource in the effort to improve children's mathematics learning. It is clear that parents' practices play a role in the development of children's mathematics skills, but little is known about how to optimize parenting practices. This research project will study how growth mindsets about mathematics ability can lead to parenting practices that enhance children's mathematics learning. A central endeavor of the project will be to test the efficacy of helping parents to hold a growth mindset. Along with the research findings, the project will also translate to a cost- and time-efficient intervention that can be implement in a variety of settings.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the impact of the intervention on parents' mindsets, their ensuing parenting practices related to mathematics learning, and the impact of those practices on children's motivation and achievement in mathematics. The project will employ an experimental intervention in which parents and children are followed over time using a variety of assessments (e.g., observations, daily reports, and standardized tests). The research will test the extent to which exposing parents to information that mathematics ability is malleable leads to a growth mindset, thereby optimizing parenting practices around mathematics with enduring benefits for children's mathematics learning. Given demographic disparities in children's mathematics achievement, a socioeconomically diverse group of European American and African American families will be recruited. This design will permit study of the extent to which the growth mindset induction along with the scaffolding activities can reduce socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. A major innovation of the project is that it will examine whether scaffolding activities (e.g., mathematics games and books) support parents in implementing their growth mindsets in a variety of situations in which they interact with children around mathematics on a daily basis."

A great deal of research has been done to understand how the open ocean is influenced by OA, but coastal systems have received little attention.  In the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) shelf region, pH in bottom waters can measure up to 0.45 units less than the pH of the pre-industrial surface ocean, in comparison to the 0.1 overall pH decrease across the entire ocean. Carbonate chemistry in the ocean is greatly influenced by even small changes in pH, so these seemingly minor changes lead to much greater impacts on the biology and chemistry of the ocean. The researchers plan to study coastal OA in the nGOM, a region subject to high inputs of nutrients from the Mississippi River.  These inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen mostly derived from fertilizers leads to increased respiration rates which decreases oxygen concentrations in the water column to the point of hypoxia in the summer.  This study will inform us how OA in coastal waters subject to eutrophication and hypoxia will impact the chemistry and biology of the region.  The researchers are dedicated to outreach programs in the Gulf and east coast regions, interacting with K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate/graduate student training, and various outreach efforts (family workshops on OA, lectures for the public and federal, state, and local representatives).  Also, a project website will be created to disseminate the research results to a wider audience. <br/><br/>Increased uptakes of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by the ocean has led to a 0.1 unit decrease in seawater pH and carbonate mineral saturation state, a process known as Ocean Acidification (OA), which threatens the heath of marine organisms, alters marine ecosystems, and biogeochemical processes. Considerable attention has been focused on understanding the impact of OA on the open ocean but less attention has been given to coastal regions.  Recent studies indicate that pH in bottom waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) shelf can be as much as 0.45 units lower relative to pre-industrial values. This occurs because the acidification resulting from increased CO2 inputs (both atmospheric inputs and in-situ respiration) decreases the buffering capacity of seawater.  This interactive effect will increase with time, decreasing summertime nGOM bottom-water pH by an estimated 0.85 units and driving carbonate minerals to undersaturation by the end of this century.  Researchers from the University of Delaware and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will carry out a combined field, laboratory, and modeling program to address the following questions. (1) What are the physical, chemical, and biological controls on acidification in coastal waters impacted by the large, nutrient-laden Mississippi River?; (2) What is the link between coastal-water acidification, eutrophication, and hypoxia; (3) How do low pH and high CO2 concentrations in bottom waters affect CO2 out-gassing during fall and winter and storm periods when the water column is mixed?; and (4) What are the influences of changing river inputs under anthropogenic forcing on coastal water acidification?<br/>Results from this research aim to further our understanding of the processes influencing ocean acidification in coastal waters subject to eutrophication and hypoxia both in the GOM and river-dominated shelf ecosystems globally."

Despite the importance of insects, only a minimal understanding of many aspects of their basic physiology still exists. Blood and air flow are critical for the transport of nutrients, hormones, and gases within an insect's body, but a comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical processes that drive fluid flow is lacking. This project tests a new hypothesis that some insects use an abdominal pump linked functionally to a ""gut piston"" to generate the principal forces driving air and blood flow. This research is motivated by three questions: 1) How does the abdominal pump help to create airflow and mixing in the insect gas exchange and transport system? 2) How are pressure differences created within the main body cavity? 3) How important is the abdominal pump for circulation? A variety of experimental and computational methods will be used to test for linkages between these systems. This research will clarify how insects pump fluids, and contribute to a broader understanding of mechanically coupled systems, with potential applications in vertebrate (including human) physiology and mechanical engineering. Mechanically-coupled physiological systems have been relatively well-studied in vertebrates, but rarely at the small sizes of insects. This research will provide, therefore, new insights into the physical basis of flow production in the most diverse group of animals on the planet. This project also includes initiatives to involve individuals from diverse backgrounds in research, and to share this research with the local and broader public. This effort includes a new program that will bring Chicago Public School students to Argonne National Laboratory to experience how synchrotron X-rays are used to image insects.<br/><br/><br/>This project proposes that the tenebrionid beetle Zophobas morio, and perhaps many insect species, utilizes a linked abdominal pump and ""gut piston"" to drive the majority of air and blood flow. A new hypothesis posits that 1) the abdominal pump raises hemolymph pressure and displaces a large amount of body volume, inducing airflows and hemolymph flows, and 2) a synchronous ""gut piston"" pressurizes the thoracic and head compartments, compressing tracheae within them, and thereby further augments pressures that drive air and blood flow within these regions. To test these hypotheses, a combination of newly developed and established techniques to measure abdominal pump volume, cardiac output, hemolymph pressures, hemolymph mixing, and tracheal airflow will be used. Specifically, this project will determine the following: how hemolymph pressures induce compression and airflow in the tracheal system; how differential pressures are created within the coelom and dorsal vessel; and how these components integrate to produce blood flows in the body. To test for linkages between abdominal pumping, hemolymph pressures, gut piston function, hemolymph mixing, and tracheal collapse, correlational approaches will be combined with experimental procedures to directly test the effects of changes in heart and abdominal pump function on airflow and blood circulation. An adaptive and parallelized immersed boundary method will also be used to solve for the flows and mixing patterns generated by the deformations of elastic and/or poroelastic models of the heart, tracheal tubes, and abdomen. Experimental measurements from the beetle will be used to validate the model, and the model will be used to address hypotheses that are difficult to probe experimentally."

In signal processing, so-called one-bit sensing replaces the usual linear measurements of a signal by incorporating the sign of the measurement. There are two motivations for this.  First, the sign function is a basic type of nonlinearity, so results about it can represent a first step towards relaxing linearity in a number of significant settings. Second, in an important technological development, one-bit measurements can be done very frequently. Surprising experiments are using new methods that need theoretical justification, and in this context one-bit measurements have proven to be just as effective as linear ones.  <br/><br/>Topics in compressive sensing have an intimate relationship to questions in discrepancy theory, with one-bit sensing being the easiest place to uncover this relationship.  This raises a new set of questions in discrepancy theory, and brings to compressive sensing new techniques.  In particular, there are new tools to study lower bounds in the subject, which can reveal how effective the current random techniques are. Also, it can provide new approaches to sampling, such as the semi-random jittered sampling.  In analysis and number theory, the project will study discrete variants of maximal oscillatory singular integrals. The latter, in the continuous case, are already fascinating objects.  Passing to the discrete variants entails many additional complications that arise from subtle arithmetic structures.  The results established in the project will be the first of this type, hence will require novel techniques.  The new approach is a synthesis of breakthrough results of Bourgain and elemental methods in phase-plane analysis."

M. oryzae is also emerging as a major pathogen of wheat. During rice infection, dome-shaped fungal cells called appressoria form on the surface of the rice leaf and access the underlying epidermal cells. Remarkably, fungal growth in living rice cells, called biotrophy, occurs for the first days of infection without activating the robust plant defenses that normally work to keep the host plant disease-free. Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this biotrophic growth stage to crop health, little is known about how plant defense suppression and fungal growth is integrated in host cells. To address these knowledge gaps, this proposal asks: How do fungal cells thrive in rice cells? To answer this, research will be directed towards characterizing mutants of M. oryzae that are impaired in their ability to colonize rice cells in order to unlock the fundamental cellular, biochemical, and genetic regulatory mechanisms that govern the rice-fungus interaction. This work could point to much needed robust and sustainable mitigation strategies and shed light on fundamental growth processes in fungi. The proposed work will foster the molecular training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through active participation in tackling the real-world problem of rice blast disease.<br/><br/>By addressing the fundamental question ""What molecular mechanisms coordinate sustained fungal growth and plant defense suppression in the host cell?"" This project aims to resolve substantial issues in plant pathology regarding the processes by which fungal pathogens thrive in plant cells. The stated objectives will use forward and reverse genetics, genome-wide proteomic and metabolic approaches, and live-cell imaging to define key exploitable differences in the metabolism of M. oryzae compared to host rice cells. This could lead to the development of novel crop protection strategies targeting molecular pathways that are critical for the biotrophic growth of the fungus but are not required for the normal function of the host cell, and could shed new light on the basic principles of cell growth. The educational objective will expand scientific education by stimulating undergraduates' science learning, preparing graduate students for scientific life beyond the university, and inspiring scientific interest in minority high school students."

Such structured and hierarchical divisions within human society are neither an essential nor inevitable condition of collective life, but develop under specific historical circumstances. Archaeology is uniquely poised to study how such ""complex societies"" come about, as it allows researchers to trace changes in social organization over the span of millennia through the material remains of human action. Such understanding helps one to better recognize both the opportunities and tradeoffs that come with different approaches to political life. Ms. Eilis Monahan of Cornell University will undertake research that investigates the early formation of complex societies, through a particular focus on landscapes and the built environment. Specifically, the research seeks to explain the roles played by defensive structures, such as fortifications, in creating the kinds of social and political boundaries that we take for granted today as basic features of modern societies. In many parts of the world, fortifications and other dramatic alterations to the landscape occur during times of transition to increased complexity. This research is therefore of broad social scientific relevance, contributing to wider debates on the relationships among power, society, and defense. Ms. Monahan's study is undertaken in collaboration with the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus and will foster collegial intellectual and professional relationships between U.S., E.U. and Cypriot students and scholars. This project will also document threatened sites of cultural and historical significance, which will aid in the development of future heritage management planning in the region.<br/><br/>Ms. Monahan will investigate how the construction of fortifications creates a ""disciplinary landscape"" that alters how people experience and perceive space, and the impacts this has on the development and reinforcement of inequality. This project focuses on a cluster of four Middle Bronze Age fortresses in the Ayios Sozomenos region in central Cyprus. Located near vital copper sources, and situated at crossroads of communication and trade across the island, these massive fortified sites appear during the dramatic transformation of Cyprus from an insular and egalitarian village-based society to a socially-stratified urban society, engaged in diplomatic relations and trade with the great polities of the Eastern Mediterranean. Combining excavation, survey, and museum study, the research will investigate how these fortresses were constructed and used in conjunction with the location and chronology of other sites in the region. By evaluating how fortresses alter the ways that people can move, see, and act, and by analyzing shifting patterns of settlement, this research will reveal how fortifications change the ways in which people interact with each other and how, in turn, this contributes to the transformation of society."

The capacity to adjust physiological traits may be especially important for amphibians because they are one of the most threatened groups of animals on the planet. Amphibians use both terrestrial and aquatic environments and thus are particularly sensitive to environmental degradation due to climate change. Unfortunately, despite increased interest in response to climate change, we know very little about how salamander populations will fare under changing conditions. The goal of this project is to identify genes that may contribute to a salamander's ability to accommodate environmental change. This study will help determine if salamander populations can evolve an increased capacity to deal with variable environments. The study will also provide underrepresented college students the opportunity to develop independent, inquiry-based projects in amphibian biology. <br/><br/>In response to climate change, organisms must adapt, acclimate, migrate, or potentially face extinction. Adaptation is a heritable evolutionary change of a population over generations. Acclimation is change that happens within the lifetime of an individual animal. If individuals vary in their capacity to acclimate, increased acclimation ability might itself evolve due to natural selection creating an adaptation of acclimation. The study will determine the capacity of individual Southern grey-cheeked salamander (Plethodon metcalfi) to adjust rates of water loss in response to temperature and humidity. Using a time-course experimental design, the study will identify differences in gene expression between individuals that acclimate and individuals that do not acclimate and identify the genes that the salamanders use to reduce rates of water loss as temperature changes. Upon identifying these genes, the study will link the activity of those genes to specific physiological responses that alter water loss. The result will be an increased understanding of the genetic basis of acclimation and adaptation to environmental cues."

A great deal of research has been done to understand how the open ocean is influenced by OA, but coastal systems have received little attention.  In the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) shelf region, pH in bottom waters can measure up to 0.45 units less than the pH of the pre-industrial surface ocean, in comparison to the 0.1 overall pH decrease across the entire ocean. Carbonate chemistry in the ocean is greatly influenced by even small changes in pH, so these seemingly minor changes lead to much greater impacts on the biology and chemistry of the ocean. The researchers plan to study coastal OA in the nGOM, a region subject to high inputs of nutrients from the Mississippi River.  These inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen mostly derived from fertilizers leads to increased respiration rates which decreases oxygen concentrations in the water column to the point of hypoxia in the summer.  This study will inform us how OA in coastal waters subject to eutrophication and hypoxia will impact the chemistry and biology of the region.  The researchers are dedicated to outreach programs in the Gulf and east coast regions, interacting with K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate/graduate student training, and various outreach efforts (family workshops on OA, lectures for the public and federal, state, and local representatives).  Also, a project website will be created to disseminate the research results to a wider audience. <br/><br/>Increased uptakes of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by the ocean has led to a 0.1 unit decrease in seawater pH and carbonate mineral saturation state, a process known as Ocean Acidification (OA), which threatens the heath of marine organisms, alters marine ecosystems, and biogeochemical processes. Considerable attention has been focused on understanding the impact of OA on the open ocean but less attention has been given to coastal regions.  Recent studies indicate that pH in bottom waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) shelf can be as much as 0.45 units lower relative to pre-industrial values. This occurs because the acidification resulting from increased CO2 inputs (both atmospheric inputs and in-situ respiration) decreases the buffering capacity of seawater.  This interactive effect will increase with time, decreasing summertime nGOM bottom-water pH by an estimated 0.85 units and driving carbonate minerals to undersaturation by the end of this century.  Researchers from the University of Delaware and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will carry out a combined field, laboratory, and modeling program to address the following questions. (1) What are the physical, chemical, and biological controls on acidification in coastal waters impacted by the large, nutrient-laden Mississippi River?; (2) What is the link between coastal-water acidification, eutrophication, and hypoxia; (3) How do low pH and high CO2 concentrations in bottom waters affect CO2 out-gassing during fall and winter and storm periods when the water column is mixed?; and (4) What are the influences of changing river inputs under anthropogenic forcing on coastal water acidification?  Results from this research aim to further our understanding of the processes influencing ocean acidification in coastal waters subject to eutrophication and hypoxia both in the GOM and river-dominated shelf ecosystems globally."

To make modern devices more suitable for use in close proximity to humans and for work in natural environments it is important that we find new ways to build machines that are biologically compatible, biodegradable, environmentally safe and able to interface with tissues. A major challenge for making such biologically compatible machines is that there are no suitable motors (actuators) to make them move. Attempts to use muscle cells derived from animals such as frogs and mice have had limited success because vertebrate tissues require an intricate blood system and they are easily damaged by changing environmental conditions. It is also hard to replicate the conditions found in a vertebrate embryo that make muscles grow appropriately. This research introduces a new biological approach to making such actuators by growing them from insect cells produced during metamorphosis. Adult insect tissues (such as flight muscles) form directly on existing larval tissues and their growth can be controlled using simple manipulations of insect hormones. Preliminary studies show that insect muscles can be grown in culture at room temperature and that they will survive for many months. This research will identify the conditions needed to generate powerful insect muscles and develop methods to grow them for use in living machines. Successful completion of this work will lead to the production of an engineered muscle that can be sustained for several months and that can generate forces ten times greater than current muscle actuators grown in culture. The work will have wider implications in revealing some of the processes (genetic, biochemical and hormonal) that lead to the re-programming of cells that must occur as part of insect metamorphosis. This is expected to stimulate new experimental approaches to studies of tissue specification, growth and repair.<br/> <br/>These studies will test the hypothesis that fully formed tissues can be grown ex-vivo from metamorphic cells of the tobacco hawk moth Manduca sexta. Using the dorsal longitudinal (flight) muscles (DFM) as a target tissue the experiments will focus on four main goals: 1) To characterize the physiological and molecular changes that accompany DFM formation during metamorphosis and in culture. Measurements will be made of in vivo changes in electrical characteristics and the contractile properties using isometric/isotonic tests and dynamic work loops. The gene expression profile (transcriptome) of developing muscles and growing explants will be compared at different stages to help identify gene networks associated with Manduca muscle formation. 2) To characterize the roles of local (cell-cell, mechanical) and systemic (circulating) factors in muscle specification, differentiation and growth. This will involve tissue excision and cross stage transplant methods that are well established for insects. 3) To recapitulate the normal formation of adult dorsal flight muscles from larval precursors in culture by engineering the hormonal and substrate conditions. The transcriptomes of the in-vitro muscles will be compared with both native larval and adult DFMs to look for changes in key developmental and physiological gene networks. 4) To grow and maintain muscle constructs in-vitro for practical actuator applications. The goal is to engineer a muscle that can be sustained for several months and that can generate stress an order of magnitude better than current in-vitro muscle actuators by maximizing survival, cell proliferation and eventual differentiation. It is expected that this process will produce densely packed muscle fibers that can be used for high-stress actuators. The unified contraction of these fibers will be controlled by growing them on micro-electrode arrays or though the expression of light-sensitive channels such as ChR2. This research will engage graduate students in cross-disciplinary research in soft robotics."

While most crops rely on nitrogen fertilizer, much of it chemically synthesized, legumes have the remarkable ability to provide their own nitrogen nutrition by entering a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, converting otherwise inert nitrogen gas in the air into ammonia. Because synthesizing chemical nitrogen fertilizers consumes massive amounts of fossil fuel and fertilizer runoff causes environmental degradation, harnessing the full potential of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis can contribute to a sustainable future. This project aims to understand at the molecular level how legumes have the capacity, absent in other crops, to engage nitrogen-fixing bacteria in a productive symbiosis. It will identify the function of key plant genes necessary to allow the bacteria to work in concert with the host. Discovering the mechanism of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis will have broad beneficial impacts on the society, which will be communicated at multiple levels to a scientifically literate public. <br/><br/>Plants and animals engage in complex and elaborate interactions with microbial partners, some detrimental and others beneficial to the host. During the symbiosis between legume and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, individual bacteria are ingested by the host and converted to membrane-bound nitrogen-fixing organelles. Recent advances in the field showed that this intracellular compartment is sustained by a specialized protein secretory system from the host, which delivers key proteins to modulate the host- microbe interface. This research project centers on understanding the mechanisms by which host secretory proteins interact with the microbe to ensure the survival of the bacteria during the intracellular stage of the symbiosis. The findings will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular dialog between hosts and their microbial partners."

These 'fungal endophytes' (endo, inside; phyte, plant) can be important in enhancing plant health under stressful conditions. However, the factors that shape the diverse communities of endophytes found in different plant species are not well understood. This project's overall goal is to integrate fungal endophytes into our understanding of tropical plant ecology, with a special focus on the relationships among leaf traits, plant productivity, and the ability of plants to defend against insects and pathogens that attack leaves.  Improving our understanding of fungal endophytes is important since they influence plant productivity and resistance to environmental stresses such as drought and disease, including for plants of economic importance. Results will facilitate use of endophytes in mitigating plant responses to a rapidly changing world, with potential applications in sustainable agriculture and forest management.  This project will also support the training of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research, including students of under-represented groups, provide mentored research experiences for K-12 teachers and for high school students, and contribute to public outreach.<br/><br/>In the context of tropical forests, where leaf traits and endophytes are highly diverse, this project will test the hypotheses that (1) endophyte communities in leaves vary in relation to leaf traits associated with growth vs. persistence strategies; (2) endophytes will influence leaf and plant functions; (3) contribution of endophytes to plant defense will vary as a function of leaf traits; and (4) understanding growth vs. persistence strategies of plants can be informed greatly by integration of these foliar symbionts. The research approach involves field observations and experiments as well as bioassays. A field experiment is planned where endophyte communities are manipulated in 12 focal species. Additionally, leaves from these same 12 species will be introduced to leaf cutter ants to test whether longer lifespan species are less attractive to leaf cutter ants, and whether this will be mediated by endophyte load. Furthermore, pathogens will be introduced to the 12 focal species to assay if damage will be lower in leaves with high endophyte loads."

Understanding how the interaction between an individual's genes and the environment during early development create the variation seen in nature is an important question in Biology. This research will leverage a well-established study system for evolutionary and behavioral research to determine how the developmental environment shapes the expression of a trait that is critical to reproductive success later in life. Specifically, this study will manipulate nest parasites, an important component of the environment, during early development to determine how parasite infections and the immune responses they generate interact with the genes that underlie plumage color in birds. Plumage color, here a brownish-red melanin coloration, is an important signal used in communication between the sexes and it is impacted by early life conditions, and therefore the reproductive success of an individual. Genes expressed in tissues where feathers are grown will be measured to allow for the identification of specific genes whose expression is influenced by environmental conditions. Results from this work will be broadly informative as melanin is a common pigment underlying appearance and coloration in various groups of animals. However, it is not well understood how the environment interacts with genes to influence the development of melanin coloration. Broader impacts include training undergraduates and middle-school teachers in scientific research, and the creation of lesson plans that will be implemented in public middle schools and shared broadly with teachers at science-teaching workshops.<br/><br/>Female preferences for male coloration are thought to be adaptive because of the potential information advertised by these male traits. Melanin-based color traits are traditionally thought to be under strict genetic control. However, condition-dependence for some melanin traits may occur during early development. If so, trait variation may provide information about an individual's developmental history. Previous work has shown that variation in melanin-based color in barn swallows is due almost entirely (70%) to differences in early environment, and that plumage color provides information about ectoparasite loads in a male's territory. Mites affect nestling survival, growth, immunity, and melanin-based plumage color. This project will identify gene expression differences associated with color variation by cross-fostering eggs and manipulating mites to tease apart the roles of genes and environmental quality. Developing feathers will be collected and RNA expression will be quantified to understand how early environment interacts with genes in the melanin pathway to influence the life-long expression of a melanin-based signal. The research will have important implications for understanding the gene by environment interactions during the early developmental period for melanin-based ornamental traits, and thus, information that females gain by using these traits. Results from this work will provide a clearer picture of how melanin-based traits interact with the environment during development at many levels: from the detailed gene expression, to lifelong trait expression, to variation within a population and how this relates to the parasite community, and finally to divergent morphological traits across populations that are involved in reproductive isolation."

These autonomous systems will be tasked with missions such as search, rescue, surveillance, reconnaissance, mapping, farming, fire fighting, and transportation. Future autonomous systems will operate in unfamiliar areas with minimal or no human interaction for prolonged periods of time. The luxury of building prior detailed maps of these environments could be (1) prohibitive (e.g., disaster areas), (2) impractical (e.g., signal landscapes and congested downtowns), or (3) economically not viable (e.g., hospital buildings and national forests). With no human-in-the-loop before or during operation, one expects future autonomous systems to (1) possess full situational awareness and (2) gather sufficient information about their environment. These two tasks need to seamlessly integrate into the overall mission of the autonomous system. Current autonomous systems are far from possessing these capabilities, and the current analytical tools are insufficient to deal with this emerging class of problems.<br/><br/>This project will develop a coherent analytical foundation and a suite of algorithms and tools for autonomous systems deployed in unknown, dynamic stochastic environments to optimally gather sufficient information to successfully accomplish their mission. The research specifically considers autonomous systems with limited sensing, computation, actuation, and communication capabilities. This research will study a new class of information optimization measures, which possess desirable convexity properties (enabling real-time execution) and separability properties (enabling near-lossless distributed implementation among agents). This research aims to establish fundamental relationships between performance and computational complexity in the presence of varying degrees of environmental uncertainty. These relationships will enable principled navigation of these complex trade-offs, leading to autonomous identification and adoption of the optimal information gathering strategy. <br/><br/>This project has a vertically-integrated education plan spanning K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. The project will also train in-service and pre-service K-12 teachers to apply Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) - a set of science standards that integrate rigorous content and application, reflecting how STEM is practiced in the real world. This research has far-reaching impact - it will evolve autonomous systems from sensing the environment to making sense of the environment, bringing new capabilities in environments where direct human control is physically or economically not possible."

The meeting will be held in Nantes, France from July 24-29, 2016.  SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth's Deep  Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical and dynamical state of the Earth's deep interior and of the effect of that the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The ""deep interior"" is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but interest often extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs.<br/><br/>This workshop will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and beginning researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep earth and other planetary interiors."

The translated technology offers reliable pressure recordings in real-time for patients suffering from chronic, often life-long medical conditions for which elevated pressure is a risk factor or indicator, and removes the need for bulky exterior diagnostic tools. The microbubble pressure sensor has the following unique features: biocompatible construction, small footprint (less than 0.1 sq. mm.), wireless control and power, and a microbubble transduction mechanism. The microbubble transduction mechanism circumvents failures modes such as mechanical fatigue and biofouling, which plague sensors that rely on deflection in elastic membranes. These features provide for an unobtrusive, reliable implant, with greater application to chronic in vivo monitoring compared to current state-of-the-art in physiological pressure monitoring. The project will result in a working prototype pressure sensor and critical data to de-risk on-going development. <br/><br/>This project addresses current technology gaps by integrating wireless circuitry for power and telemetry into the existing prototype microbubble transducer and by generating critical characterization data on long term accuracy, precision and repeatability, as necessary steps for translating the technology toward commercial deployment. Graduate and undergraduate researchers will work to finalize device electronics and packaging and calibrate the prototype pressure sensor with thorough benchtop testing. In addition, all personnel involved in this project, will benefit from translational education programs offered by our I-Corps node and Coulter workshop series that will expose them to customer discovery, customer interviews, Lean Startup methodology, medical device commercialization, and regulatory and reimbursement strategy. <br/><br/>The team is collaborating with neurosurgeons at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles; they will provide guidance in design and deployment of biomedical technologies for hydrocephalus.  The team will also leverage industry connections and technology commercialization programs for guidance and training on commercialization, manufacturing, and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology into a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic and societal impact of this project include greater US competitiveness in biomedical sensing technology, and the improvements in healthcare quality and reductions in healthcare cost realized by new clinical pressure sensors, that offer data driven diagnostics and timely medical interventions for chronically suffering patients."

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."

A key enabler of any engineering solution for the above is deployment of (low cost) hardware in conjunction with appropriate networking and storage resources and a software infrastructure that allows for persistent monitoring of spectrum usage.  This pilot project will produce the first calibrated large-scale data sets (over frequency, time and region) of spectrum usage archived for post-processing. Such a database will be a unique national resource for any future spectrum engineering efforts; its impact will extend well beyond the academic community. The data-driven research that it enables will provide valuable inputs for spectrum policymakers charged with formulation of new spectrum sharing rules.<br/><br/>This project significantly extends the state-of-the art in spectrum monitoring: first and foremost, it will result in the first wide-area, persistent and taskable spectrum monitoring and data collection infrastructure without using expensive high-end sensors, but still capable of gathering unprecedented amount of good quality spectrum data that will be stored and made publicly available for further investigations by research community. Further, the design will constitute the first step towards future networked monitoring infrastructure that can allow for distributed experimentation by researchers who will have the ability to task desired sensor sub-sets simultaneously for data acquisition in desired spectrum bands. This will enable data mining of spectrum usage patterns as a function of both space and time, which is currently not possible."

This project explicitly addresses the practice of expert judgment in a major domain of contemporary scientific activity. It will also provide suggestions to improve the assessment and decision process. Assessments are expensive in terms of time, money, and scientific human capital, and it important for the scientific community re-assess the commitment that has been made to them. The researchers will produce policy-relevant and scientist-relevant papers to convey project findings to the IPCC and involved scientist assessors.

For example, governments committed to large pension payments may have difficulty in meeting debt obligations. The results can be serious: for example, in the United States cities such as San Bernardino and Detroit have defaulted on their debts. Understanding the interplay between the incentive to accumulate debt and to promise entitlements is of crucial importance for understanding these actual and possible future episodes. In this project, the investigators use economic theory to analyze the political determinants of debt and entitlements and the relationship between these two components of governmental, fiscal obligations. <br/><br/>Despite a large literature on the political economy of debt and many papers on pensions, there is almost no work that studies the political economy of the interaction between debt and entitlements. This project aims at developing a new framework to fill this important gap. This research contrasts debt and entitlements in resource allocations: debt transfers resources across periods, whereas entitlements directly target the future allocation of resources. The investigators introduce the study of entitlements into a dynamic political economy models, and analyze the impact of entitlements on debt. The research also examines how the levels of debt and entitlements change as the persistence of political power changes, or as the political system becomes more unstable. The project further investigates the determinants and the consequences of the joint growth in government debt and entitlements since the 1970s.

In addition the workshop activities will include an oral history project with high school students and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>This workshop will gather post-doctoral scholars, junior faculty and more senior scholars in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine (HSTM) to re-frame the historical study of people historically marginalized in STEM disciplines and in the historical records of those fields. The workshop will provide an opportunity to inquire into the nature of perceptions of individual capacity, epistemic commitment, and institutional aims historically circulating throughout both STEM and HSTM disciplines.  The goal of the workshop is to recast the possible function of biography as social critique by considering the perpetually low representation of persons of minority background in organizations such as the History of Science Society, the Society for the History of Technology, and the American Association for the History of Medicine.  By probing the relational character of history/history-writing the workshop will identify exclusionary patterns, the routine marginalization of STEM aspirants, historical subjects and HSTM scholars of minority identity in order to increase participation and awareness of under-represented groups in the production of histories of science, technology and medicine. The results will contribute to an enhanced critical pedagogy and the testing of the critical potential of biography in confronting inequitable social relations that will be disseminated at professional societies serving the STS community."

Colostrum proteins have both beneficial health and growth properties that may drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics. Unfortunately, there is a limited supply of colostrum. Algae provide an affordable and scalable system for the production of the valuable proteins found in colostrum. Recently, it was demonstrated that the use of antibiotics in livestock animals caused the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Colostrum proteins naturally stimulate the animal's immune system and allows them to improve their own ability to fight off infections and ultimately increase their rate of weight gain. The production of colostrum proteins at a large scale in an untapped market that has the potential to gain market share from the multi-billion dollar antibiotic industry. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing colostrum proteins in algae using biomanufacturing. Some of the problems associated with having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost and feasibility. To accomplish the goal of decreasing antibiotic use, this project will first focus on optimizing the production process to drive the cost of producing colostrum proteins in algae down. Next, work will be done on developing optimal formulations of colostrum proteins and testing them in mice models before moving to larger livestock animals. Once an optimal formulation is established, trials will be done in pig models. In the pig models, colostrum proteins produced in algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain. Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects."

Current gold isolation methods involve the consumption of vast quantities of sodium cyanide, where cyanide is contained in large tailing dams, posing an environmental threat as exemplified by documented breaches. In the United States there are gold deposits which have not been exploited because of technology limitations and environmental concerns. The technology being developed in this project will improve the profitability of existing mines, as it can be employed with only minor changes in plant design. It will also  but will also lead to new jobs. Another opportunity is to extract gold from copper tailings dams. The proposed technology will potentially make cleanup of these sites profitable and can be applied worldwide. In the longer term, the process could be adopted in third world countries which still rely on mercury which pollutes, not only the environment, but also the food chain.<br/><br/>The objectives of this Phase II research project are to (i) scale up the extraction of gold using both the heap and vat leach processes, (ii) optimize the crystallization of Au(III) in the presence of the natural product -cyclodextrin, and (iii) isolate the gold. For heap leaching, it is proposed to operate at the 400-MT level, concentrate the gold salt and crystallize the gold-cyclodextrin complex. Scale-up will require designing the process to utilize existing equipment (built originally for the sodium cyanide process) and introducing new chemicals. For vat leaching, a small pilot system will be built to accept crushed ore as the feed, and the resulting gold-containing extract will be taken through the crystallization process. Optimization of the leaching agent, mass transfer, kinetics and materials consumption will be ongoing.  Regulatory approval for vat leaching, once secured, can be applied on-site globally to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of the process. This technology has the potential to significantly make existing and new mining operations more environmentally sustainable."

Cave minerals are capable of recording these processes because as they grow they record the chemistry of groundwater seeping into the cave through time. Carbon isotope ratios in cave minerals have the potential to provide essential clues as to how Earth's carbon cycle responded to past climate changes. However, though carbon isotope ratios in cave minerals are easily measured, they can be difficult to interpret given the number of factors that influence cave systems. The goal of this research is to use observations of water chemistry variability from the surface through the soil and into a Tennessee cave system to construct and verify a computer model that simulates the transport and reaction of carbon in the Earth's surface. This software can be used to question the environmental factors that are most important for controlling carbon isotopes in cave systems. Through this research, a new and versatile computational capability will emerge to help determine how climate is recorded in cave minerals. This will provide a deeper understanding of carbon cycle response to past climate changes and thus help to make critical predictions for the future. This project is led by two early career female scientists and will involve the training of two new Ph.D. students and at least two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Carbon isotope records of speleothem hold great potential for reconstructing past changes in the Earth's surface response to climate change, such as transient vegetation, soil respiration, carbon stabilization in deep soils, and/or chemical weathering in the epikarst. Yet, because of their inherent complexity, these data often go unpublished and un-interpreted, despite being regularly collected during more common oxygen isotope investigations. By sampling waters from soils and drip sites within a cave on a multi-year timescale, it is possible to observe how seasonal environmental signals are translated and modified along heterogeneous flow paths in the soil and epikarst. However, interpreting time-averaged speleothem records representing climate changes occurring over years to centuries requires integration of observational data and simulation studies that provide a temporal bridge between long and short-term processes. The current research tackles this problem through the development of a carbon isotope enabled reactive transport model that is calibrated and tested in a karst system, providing a novel tool for the investigation and interpretation of speleothem carbon isotope records. This will be accomplished through modification of the reactive transport model CrunchTope to accommodate three-isotope systems to simulate stable and radioactive carbon isotope fractionation and decay within a multicomponent reaction network. Validation of the model for karst settings will be accomplished using data from an ongoing environmental monitoring program at Blue Spring Cave in Tennessee. Once functionality of the CrunchTope model has been demonstrated for the Blue Spring karst environment, this approach can be expanded to investigate carbon isotope systematics and speleothem carbon isotope records from a variety of cave settings and climate regimes. Looking beyond carbon, this model will provide a versatile tool for evaluating the partitioning and resultant distribution of numerous isotope systems in karst settings (e.g. Calcium, Magnesium, Strontium, Uranium), and thus the model will facilitate development and interpretation of a variety of cutting-edge paleoclimate proxy records from cave environments."

The development of a unified pan arctic conceptual model for the Arctic Ocean, which may include a nested array of additional models addressing specific regions and processes, will be enable improved coordination of research efforts addressing the Arctic Ocean in a time of change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The Arctic Ocean is a region of peaceful and constructive political and economic cooperation, which can be improved through science-based knowledge sharing and unifying concepts. The outcome of this workshop will be reported in two publications: (1) an extended revision of conceptual models of the Arctic Ocean, and (2) a compact and distilled version of the unified conceptual model to be developed at the workshop identifying the key processes and levers governing the response of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem to change. The workshop will be held and its products developed during the period of the US Chairmanship of the international Arctic Council, to reach a broad research community, including researchers and research managers nationally and internationally. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Addressing the conceptualization of Arctic processes must focus on the pan arctic marine environment but encompass the full marine - land - atmosphere system. Many nations, both Arctic and non-Arctic, are elaborating major research programs aimed at advancing our understanding of the Arctic Ocean system in a time of change, as a pre-requisite to managing the imminent pressures derived from the forecasted increase in industry operations in the Arctic.  However, these programs, involving great efforts and resources, are largely lacking a shared paradigm, or understanding to help identify the key processes that such programs should aim to resolve. There is a risk that these research programs will suffer from a lack of focus and their outcomes, as well as fail to achieve synergy with one another. As a result, while each effort may be scientifically relevant and sound, collectively they may fall short of providing the high level understanding required, leaving us in a marginal position to manage the impacts of economic growth and industry operations in the future Arctic. This effort aims to address that by providing the high level thinking needed to help guide scientific planning in the Arctic."

WSNs face significant scalability challenges due to the proliferation of emerging wide-area wireless monitoring and control systems (e.g., urban sensing, large civil infrastructure monitoring, oil field management) that require thousands of sensors be connected over long distances. Due to their short communication range, existing WSN technologies face critical challenges in terms of energy, cost, and complexity to achieve scalability in wide-area deployments. To address this limitation, this project proposes a scalable sensor network architecture - called Sensor Network Over White Spaces (SNOW) - by designing sensor networks to operate over the TV white spaces, which refer to the allocated but unused TV channels. This project will lead to a new generation of WSN that will operate over white spaces, enabling a broad range of applications that involve wide-area monitoring and control. Besides its scientific impact across multiple subareas of computer science, it will impact education, outreach, and diversity. The scientific contributions of the project will be incorporated in various computer science courses. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and hands-on experimental opportunities will attract diverse students to participate in the project including women and under-represented students. The principal investigator (PI) will leverage collaborations with industrial partners to transfer the technology to industries for future WSN mote design and also will work with standards bodies to standardize the technology to be developed in this project. <br/><br/>Since the TV transmissions are in lower frequencies (50-698 MHz), white spaces have excellent propagation characteristics over long distances. Compared to the ISM band, they are less crowded. Long range will reduce most WSNs to a single-hop structure that has potential to reduce the complexity, overhead, and latency that existing WSN technologies operating in 2.4GHz face due to multi-hop. SNOW hence can support large-scale sensor deployments over wide areas. However, most WSN applications need low data rate, low power nodes, and require scalability and energy efficiency. The SNOW architecture achieves scalability and energy efficiency through channel splitting and enabling simultaneous packet receptions with single radio. The base station is power-rich and has a single transceiver that uses available wide spectrum from white spaces. The spectrum is split into narrow subcarriers that have longer range and that consume less power. The sensor nodes transmit using their assigned sub-carriers asynchronously. The base station is able to process multiple sub-carriers simultaneously. Enabling such simultaneous receptions at a node is challenging as it requires a novel decoder design. In the SNOW architecture, this is done through Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) that provides distinct orthogonal signals. The contributions of this project will include: (1) the design of the physical layer of SNOW that includes white space spectrum splitting into narrow band subcarriers and a demodulator design that can decode simultaneous packet receptions; (2) the design of the media access control protocol for SNOW that handles subcarrier allocation among the nodes and their transmission scheduling; (3) the implementation of the SNOW architecture on a prototype hardware, and evaluation through realistic experiments."

Graduate and undergraduate trainees in the Stephenson group are exposed to a broad range of interdisciplinary topics, such as catalysis, photochemistry, renewable energy and flow chemistry. <br/><br/><br/>The focus is on using electron transfer-initiated transformations to promote chemoselective C-O and C-C bond cleavage reactions of lignin chemical linkages, processes for sustainable chemistry that are situated at the intersection of organometallic chemistry, photochemistry and materials science. These operationally simple, catalytic methods obviate the need for specialized photochemistry equipment, utilizing inexpensive and energy efficient LEDs for irradiation. The challenges of lignin degradation are addressed using a combination of oxidative and reductive visible light-mediated radical chemistry. The proposal consists of three specific aims: 1) development of new catalytic oxidation methods employing both photoredox catalysis and electron shuttling agents; 2) development of novel visible light-mediated reductive C-O and C-C cleavage methods; 3) implementation of the strategies developed in aims 1 and 2 toward the degradation of commercial lignin in continuous flow. The objectives advance the broader concept of sustainable chemistry without compromising reaction efficiency and chemoselectivity."

Change has been targeted at the course and curriculum levels, focusing on teaching and learning methods and proving their efficacy. While beneficial, these activities have not fostered the strategies - such as motivation, communication, collaboration, and persuasion - that are necessary if individuals wish to enact change on larger, more institutional levels. These change strategies are well known but have not been brought into STEM education in a rigorous, accessible way. The workshop Making Academic Change Happen (MACH) fills the need for research-based skills development and assistance in creating a plan for change. Through targeted working sessions on specific topics participants learn research-proven strategies for making large scale change happen on their home campus. Our focus for the 2016 MACH Workshop is emerging engineering educators.  The primary experience of graduate training is introduction to and acquiring competence in disciplinary research. We have determined, however, that new engineering educators are tasked with developing new courses, curricula, and programs.  These initiatives require additional skills or areas of expertise: advising, mentoring, curriculum development, imaginative vision, program assessment, etc. None of these skills are likely addressed in a typical engineering Ph.D. curriculum. For these reasons, we argue that new engineering educators who envision themselves as change agents should work to adopt the disposition and skills of a change agent.  Attending the MACH Workshop will help these educators start on their path as engineering education innovators.<br/><br/>The purpose of this workshop is 1) to assist emerging engineering educators in learning and practicing skills needed to lead change, and 2) prepare working documents around a variety of topics that are necessary to advance a change project. By fostering the development of these skills and mindsets in the very people who must lead change efforts, this workshop promotes meaningful change in STEM higher education. The change projects advanced by the workshop participants are expected to become model programs that can be used as example strategies and processes for others hoping to implement similar ideas. These projects reach beyond a single classroom, focusing more on the underlying processes, approaches, or philosophy of STEM education enacted on their campus. By working within the institution's context, the change agents trained during the MACH workshop will positively impact the student experience of STEM.<br/> <br/>As part of this research, we will interview the emerging engineering educators about their change projects and provide them with mentors and support for their change activities.  We will continue to offer mentorship after the workshop is over, and we will keep track of their progress on their change projects as they implement the MACH change strategies they learned during the workshop."

Current molecular sensors are complex, expensive and suffer from limited reproducibility and scalability. These facts have hampered the adoption of molecular sensors despite immense industrial and scientific interest from the fields of forensics, toxicology, and biomedicine. Highly scalable and inexpensive, SERF (Sensitive Erasable Reproducible Flow-through) sensors will lead to an era of ubiquitous molecular identification devices for diverse applications such as biometric and health screening, trace hazard detection (biohazards, toxins, drugs, and explosive residues), and chemical quality control. In addition to affordable manufacturing, the SERF technology has a 7 fold higher sensitivity and greater uniformity than the leading commercial substrate (Klarite(TM); Renishaw Inc.). The SERF sensor also has first-of-a-kind capabilities in flow-through detection and surface cleaning for reuse. The project will identify the most commercially viable molecular target for the SERF sensor and optimize the material and a prototype for the detection of this molecule. <br/><br/>This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates a laboratory discovery into a commercial application. First, composed of a high density of optically responsive nanopores rather than the low-density micropatterned features, the SERF sensor improves both the sensitivity and uniformity of detection compared to the leading photonic-based sensors. Second, as a porous structure the SERF technology allows sample flow through the sensor, overcoming diffusion limited response times that are impractical (days) for trace molecules with existing sensors. Finally, the SERF sensor can be reused or cleaned with the application of a small current through its contiguous metallic surface. This feature can be used to reset sensors and to overcome performance loss due to fouling.      <br/><br/>The project brings together a world-leading nanomembrane manufacturer (Roussie Co-PI; SiMPore Inc.) with a leading nanomembrane research laboratory (McGrath PI; University of Rochester) and world-class experts in photonics (Webb Co-PI; Nottingham University) to translate a novel laboratory discovery toward commercial impact in industries that improve human welfare. A University of Rochester graduate student and co-inventor of the SERF technology will receive hands on entrepreneurship training by working with PIs and Co-PIs in customer discovery interviews and in the development of a business model canvas."

This project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas, as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.<br/> <br/>The core technology to be developed further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives. This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn, helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.  After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant by the end of this project."

One of the most extreme predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes, compact objects whose gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from them. Investigating gravity in such an extreme regime provides one of the most promising opportunities to learn more about this fundamental force. Another prediction of general relativity, that binary black holes emit gravitational waves that stretch and squeeze spacetime, was recently confirmed by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).  Black holes are fully described by their masses and spins, but the spins of binary black holes are generally misaligned with their orbital plane, much like the 23 degree misalignment between the Earth's rotation axis and its orbit about the Sun responsible for the seasons. General relativity causes black-hole spins to change direction or precess; this precession leaves detectable signatures in the gravitational waves observed by LIGO. This award supports studies on black-hole spin precession and the extent to which it can be constrained by gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO. This work helps scientists to interpret LIGO observations and thus better understand gravity and the astrophysical origin of black holes responsible for their spin misalignments. The PI and collaborators will also develop an interactive virtual-reality simulation of precessing black holes and the gravitational waves they emit which will be available free online and presented at local public libraries and museums through existing outreach networks of the University of Texas at Dallas. These simulations help the public virtually experience the effects of gravitational waves and enhance public interest and support for science research and education.<br/><br/>This goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the origin and implications of misalignments between binary black-hole spins and their orbital angular momentum. Population-synthesis codes will be used to explore how initial spin misalignments depend on various aspects of astrophysical black-hole formation like mass transfer, tidal alignment, and supernova recoils. The spin distributions generated by these codes will be evolved from black-hole formation until they begin to emit detectable gravitational waves using the PI's newly developed technique for efficiently calculating spin precession on the inspiral timescale. Once the binaries enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors like LIGO, publicly available codes in the LIGO Algorithm Library Suite will be used to generate waveforms and analyze how well the binary black-hole parameters that determine spin precession can be estimated for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. The PI and collaborators will also perform and analyze numerical-relativity simulations to assess the reliability of post-Newtonian predictions for spin precession in the final orbits before black-hole merger. This research provides the basis for astrophysical model selection, combining constraints on spin misalignments from many events to distinguish astrophysical models of black-hole formation, such as dynamical formation in a globular cluster (for which spins should be isotropic) versus formation from stellar binaries (which should exhibit a tendency towards aligned spins). The final project will consider how spin precession between black hole formation and merger affects predictions for final black-hole masses, spins, and gravitational recoils.  This project has implications both for the stellar-mass black holes observed by LIGO and recoiling quasars spatially or kinematically offset from their host galaxies sought in galaxy surveys."

Bennett of the Department of Chemistry at Tufts University is developing new, efficient chemical approaches to combine single sugar molecules into chains of sugars called oligosaccharides.  Oligosaccharides are found on the surfaces of cells and are important in mediating immune system responses.  Reagent kits are being developed for the general construction of well-defined oligosaccharides much faster than is currently possible and with the production of less waste. This research program impacts science and technologies that utlize oligosaccharides, including agriculture, biotechnology and pharmaceutical science. Professor Bennett's group has an ongoing commitment to training undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry research methods.  They are also involved in outreach to Somerville, MA high school students by providing them with an introduction to organic chemistry and how it can be used to create biologically relevant molecules.  The community of Somerville is diverse, so this program reaches many students from groups that are historically underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Prof. Bennett is studying how to place the stereochemical outcome of a glycosylation reaction entirely under control of the promoter.  For beta-selective glycosylations this involves activating hemiacetals with sulfonyl chlorides, while alpha-linked deoxy-sugars can be synthesized from hemiacetals using cyclopropenium cation promoted glycosylations.  Three areas of investigation are being pursued: 1) an examination of the generality of this chemistry by exploring its compatibility with an array of deoxy-sugar coupling partners. 2) A study of the utility of this chemistry in the linear and convergent synthesis of penta- and hexasaccharides from natural products. 3) Studies to determine if this chemistry can be applied to the construction of beta-rhamnosides, an important class of carbohydrate linkages that currently cannot be synthesized directly in a single chemical transformation.  Together, these studies may result in methods for the reliable stereoselective construction of difficult to access glycosidic linkages. Lessons learned from these studies also may permit the application of this chemistry to other classes of glycosides or even oligosaccharide and glycoconjugate libraries. Such libraries would open up new avenues for drug discovery and accelerate the pace of research in the field of glycobiology."

The CT scanner at UT was specifically designed to enable x-ray tomography of a range of geological materials and sample sizes. The technology was developed from commercial biomedical CAT scanners with the adoption of a higher energy x-ray source and higher resolution CCD detectors to allow micron-scale imaging of geological samples. The technique allows for completely non-destructive imaging of the exteriors and interiors of samples. Differences in x-ray attenuation that occur due to variations in sample density and the elemental composition of the material along the x-ray path are digitally recorded by a CCD. Samples are mounted on a rotating table in front of the x-ray source. Radial 2-d slices of the attenuated x-rays are stacked by vertical translation of the sample table. Resultant x-ray sinograms are then reduced via computer algorithms to render high resolution 3-D images of the density distributions within samples. <br/><br/>A recent upgrade of the UTCT high energy system has increased both resolution and scanning speed, lowering costs for lab clients and opened a multitude of new research possibilities. In particular, it enables 4-D scanning of systems in motion (during fluid flow, cooling, heating, strain, etc.). Exploration and exploitation of these new capabilities for an expanded range of studies including studies of fluid flow through fractured and porous media with relevance to groundwater hydrology, hydrocarbon reservoir extraction enhancement and carbon dioxide subsurface sequestration will be enabled by this renewal award. Continued support will benefit a large and diverse set of research constituencies. Over the previous period of support, UTCT has served over 190 principal investigators, most of whom are Earth scientists spanning the full breadth of subdisciplines, including petrology, paleontology, structural geology, hydrology, meteoritics, and economic and petroleum geology. UTCT's clientele also includes many researchers in other fields, principally biology, engineering, and anthropology. Three-quarters of investigators were from outside the University of Texas. The facility will continue to support user training through developed short courses and assist users in data reduction routines.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through advancing knowledge of the behavior of water and hydrocarbon in the subsurface as well training students in cutting edge analytical methods in the sciences.<br/><br/><br/>***"

They also pose a significant problem for pet health in the industrialized world, and more important, human health in the developing world. In 2011, sales of the anti-nematode drug Ivermectin exceeded $1 billion. Unfortunately current solutions are becoming obsolete due to emerging resistance to existing drugs, and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. New pesticides and drugs are needed to prevent nematode damage to crops, animals and humans, and this represents a potentially significant economic opportunity we hope to address.  This I-Corps team has developed a process that can be used to identify chemical compounds that kill nematode pests in a novel way. In addition, the proposed method can be selective, in that the compounds developed for commercial use can be active against nematodes, and be inactive against humans and other animals. This differentiation will allow users to reduce the environmental toxicity of anti-nematode compounds, a key obstacle to pesticide use today. <br/><br/>The overall goals of this project are to develop and commercialize new chemical compounds that can be used to combat parasitic nematodes in agricultural, veterinary, and human health applications. The team's approach is to screen chemical libraries for compounds that can activate parasite target proteins required for neuronal or muscular function. Exposure to the compound will cause lethal disruption of nematode physiology, which should prevent establishment and promote clearance of nematode infestations. Unfortunately, direct screening of parasitic nematodes is impractical because they are very difficult to culture and genetically manipulate in the lab. To meet this challenge the team has created an innovative method that involves screening genetically engineered laboratory nematodes (C. elegans) expressing parasite targets, such that target activation causes paralysis (an easy to score phenotype amenable to automated screening). ). In contrast to more traditional methods, which utilize cultured mammalian cells, the proposed screen ensures that compounds will be active within the nematode physiological context (i.e. the target is integrated into its normal signaling pathways, and the compound can penetrate the nematode protective cuticle, and is thus bio-available).  Customer discovery interviews during the I-Corps program will help the team refine and focus these goals to fill existing market needs for new anti-nematode compounds. The potential contribution of this work will be to bring one new anti-nematode compound to the market, but perhaps more importantly, establish an ongoing pipeline for the discovery and commercialization of future anti-nematode compounds to optimally fit specific market needs in agriculture, veterinary medicine, and human medicine, and to keep ahead of resistance as it emerges."

Gaining an understanding of when interns are exploited, and when they are valued, is essential to understanding labor market entry. Previous studies of internships focus on industry case studies. This dissertation is the first comparative study of majors and internship sites to address the question -- under what conditions are internships precarious work and under what conditions are they a stepping stone to a career?  Answering this question has application to both the social sciences and national discourse about the economy, speaking to issues salient to policymakers, corporations, and a concerned citizenry. This project will help individuals and institutions make better decisions about utilizing internships. <br/><br/>This study makes use of a longitudinal interview research design with two waves of interviews.  Wave one involves interviewing college seniors in four majors about their internships. These are Business/Operations and Logistics; Industrial Engineering; English; and Communications.  Wave two follows up one year later. This design links internship to college major and labor market entry. This study makes contributions to the sociology of work, economic sociology, and the sociology of education. Precarity and insecurity of work is a much-discussed topic in the sociology of work. This study will examine how interns are used by employers and the effects of their labor process on interns' experiences and outcomes. In theory less precarity should increase chances in the labor market, but economic sociology suggests other factors might be more important than the content of the internship. This study will add to knowledge on how non-labor process factor, such social networks or sociability with coworkers, affect internship experiences and outcomes. This study can also make contributions to the sociology of education. Competing theories on labor market entry such as whether majors build human capital or act as a screening device will be adjudicated by this research."

Yet despite the significant presence of female immigrants in the United States, few studies have examined these issues among foreign-born women, particularly the five million women who are undocumented. Undocumented, foreign-born women have lower labor force participation rates than their male counterparts, documented immigrant women, and native-born women. To examine how foreign-born Latina women make decisions about work and family under precarious legal conditions, this doctoral dissertation research examines three questions: 1) How do Latina immigrant women?s legal status and family structure shape their labor force decisions and opportunities within new destination communities in the United States? 2) How do Latina immigrants negotiate motherhood under conditions of precarious legal status? 3) How do women in a new destination community interpret and respond to shifting immigration policies and contexts of reception at federal, state, and local levels? To answer these questions, the co-PI is conducting in-depth interviews with Latina immigrant mothers in central North Carolina and participant observation at community meetings that discuss immigration programs and policies. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to sociological knowledge by bridging the work-family and international migration literatures, developing understanding of women's labor force decisions in new immigrant destinations in the United States, and generating new understanding of gender and international migration policy. These findings will be relevant for scholars of international migration, gender, and work and occupations, as well as policymakers at local, state, and federal levels and immigrant-serving organizations.

As a magnetic star, our Sun has disrupted, and will continue to threaten disrupting, these technology-dependent activities.  In order to mitigate the inevitable risks, it is vital that we advance our understanding of the processes behind events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CME).  The solar magnetic field that underlies all of these phenomena arises from the flows present in the solar plasma.  These flows are produced by the transport of energy through the solar interior.  This 3-year research project is expected to improve our knowledge of the structure, dynamics and flows immediately below the surface of the Sun.  This region is key to understanding and predicting solar activity.  This research project features not only important academic research, but also promises a tangible and concrete benefit to our technologically powered society.<br/><br/>This 3-year project is aimed at a better characterization of the Sun's near-surface layers (outermost 5% of the solar interior) using helioseismic techniques.  A key question that this work will contribute to answering is: how and why does the Sun (and other Sun-like stars) vary?  Using helioseismology, the project team will be able to infer and constrain changes in the structure and dynamics of the solar interior by extending the precise characterization of p-mode (or pressure-mode) oscillations to higher spatial degrees and tracking their changes with time.  The technical aspect of this project is to derive accurate characteristics of high-degree modes, i.e., precise and unbiased estimates of mode frequency, line width, asymmetry and amplitude for spherical harmonics degrees in the range 200-900, using NSO's Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) observations.  The research work to be carried out would enhance the scientific return of the GONG mission, which has been supported by the NSF.

The purpose is to explore efficiencies in the management of these arrays and optimize resources by designing a shared framework for integrated data storage, archiving, dissemination, and high-level data products.  Since these independent arrays observe different portions of Earth's space environment (Earth-space), their further development and integration has potential for providing a powerful tool for synthesizing information about its global dynamics. The planned shared framework will be separate from the scientific research, proposed and performed by individual investigator teams, and thus will provide much needed continuity for funding the instrumentation and data distribution during lapses in individual research funding. The effects of these interruptions are compounded because observations from these magnetometer arrays are used by the broader research community and in international collaborations, in addition to their use in scientific research by the magnetometer teams, themselves.  Efficiencies in the operation and maintenance of ground-based magnetometer arrays as well as in the development of new global high-level data products will strengthen and improve a valuable U.S. infrastructure for exploring Earth-space and understanding its long-term evolution. <br/><br/>Ground-based magnetometers make use of signatures in the Earth's magnetic field to explore and understand Earth-space.  These signatures provide information about ionospheric currents associated with geomagnetic storms and substorms, the magnetosphere's response to interplanetary shocks, the reconfiguration of currents and convection as the solar wind driving changes, and the propagation of energy through Earth-space carried by long-period plasma waves.   They provide the longest record of Earth-space observations and thus are key to our understanding of long-term variations in that environment.  Magnetometer arrays are supported and maintained by countries all over the world so the US arrays contribute valuable information to synthesizing an understanding of the global dynamics in Earth-space. Efficiencies in operations and maintenance of these arrays are important to enable the continuing support and further development of this valuable national observing capability."

In contrast, research with populations in conflict zones around the world indicate that many violent or intractable conflicts involve what are called ""devoted actors"", whose often violent actions are driven not by cost-benefit judgments but by a commitment to sacred values (e.g. ""My values are not for sale""; ""Do the right thing regardless of the consequences)"", a feeling of fusion with the group, and a set of perceptions of the motives of adversary groups. The goal of this research is to create a theoretical framework that explores how these aspects of human psychology interact and will lead to novel insights that will help answer questions such as: How do people trade off competing sets of sacred values, and ties to groups they are fused with (e.g., to family or nation)? Why do some devoted actors choose to use violence while others refrain from violence? The results of this work may expand possibilities for conflict reduction, including counter-radicalization efforts and negotiation and adjudication of conflicting values over transcultural boundaries. The research also contributes to building the infrastructure of science and involves not only training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellow whose diversity mirrors the diversity of the cultures studied, but also the research team continues to engage with the communities in the research and to foster the research training of members in these communities.<br/><br/>The aim of the proposed research is to understand how sacred values (SVs), identity fusion theory (IFT), and beliefs about the nature and motives of adversary groups influence intergroup conflicts, including their escalation into seemingly intractable violence. This involves developing and testing theory regarding how these three phenomena interact to produce devoted actors, people willing to sacrifice material concerns and responsibility to primary reference groups and suffer, die, and kill for abstract ideals (such as nation, religious or ideological groups). Studies in the United States, the West Bank/Gaza, Morocco and Spain investigate (a) the identity function of SVs, (b) the way SVs and identity fusion interact under threat to influence moral trade-offs between competing sacred values and identity groups, (c) the moderating role of beliefs about the outgroups in facilitating violent parochial altruism, that is, self-sacrifice for the ingroup; and (d) leverage this knowledge to develop interventions that facilitate more cooperative intergroup interactions. To do this, the research team  employs the complementary talents of senior researchers and students in three disciplines (social psychology, political psychology, anthropology) who have played leading roles in developing knowledge about SVs, IFT and the way morally motivated choices play out in resource and political conflicts. Using innovative online and offline behavioral and self-report measures the team has developed, the methodology integrates basic and applied research, combining laboratory and field experiments, surveys, and interviews in order to provide ""real-world"" relevance for policy makers."

Ideally, one would like to transmit at as low data rate as possible, while reconstructing with good fidelity, and suffering only a short delay. All three goals cannot be met at the same time; rather, there exists a fundamental distortion-rate-delay trade-off, unbreachable by any technology. This project aims to advance the state of the art in the understanding of that fundamental trade-off. Its intellectual impact fuses theoretical interest in coverings of space with practical considerations of lossy source coding. The project is expected to  generate mathematical tools to study efficient multidimensional coverings of space, and suggest simple and efficient coding schemes informing further technological progress in high definition content delivery.<br/><br/>The key to the proposed technical approach is a rigorous analysis of high resolution lossy data compression. In that regime, the data is compressed with low distortion at the expense of a high rate.  The most relevant regime in many practical data compression scenarios, it also lends itself to analysis more easily than the general case, giving rise to explicit, computable formulas that provide valuable insights into the design of practical data compressors. Leveraging the simplifications afforded by the high resolution assumption, the project is expected to provide approximations to the optimal finite blocklength trade-offs and suggests simple coding schemes that achieve them in such analytically challenging scenarios as universal lossy data compression, lossy data compression of sources with memory, and multiterminal lossy data compression. In addition to the planned research activities, the project includes curricular development, graduate student mentoring, and outreach to undergraduates and under-represented minorities."

The project is applying recent advances in deep learning, optimization, and machine learning to practical real-world scientific applications involving the analysis of materials from Earth and outer space, such as Mars, as well as the mapping of Martian and terrestrial surfaces through hyperspectral imagery.<br/><br/>Deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks to construct a hierarchy of latent representations of high-dimensional datasets.  This project designs novel architectures and algorithms for deep learning, and applies them to spectroscopic domains, such as LIBS and hyperspectral imaging. Three challenges from spectroscopic domains guide the research. First, in many applications such as the Curiosity rover on Mars, the number of available LIBS spectra are limited as it requires an active sensing operation followed by transmission of data by a robot situated millions of miles from Earth. A further challenge is that data from Mars is inherently unlabeled, and instrumental variations and terrain variations between Earth and Mars require solving a key transfer learning problem. For hyperspectral imaging, the project is extending work on deep learning applied to two-dimensional images to data that involves two spatial dimensions as well as the third spectral dimension, where images are recorded at multiple wavelengths. This project explores a variety of ways of designing new convolutional neural networks and other approaches that can effectively exploit the third spectral dimension."

Different features require different data collection modalities,  and merging these different types of data correctly is one of several technically challenging tasks this research will perform.  This type of multiscale, multimodal brain mapping is one of the scientific Grand Challenges, as such it is a top U.S.A. research priority, one recognized by the BRAIN initiative.

Specifically, the project aims include: 1) construct, cross-validate, fuse, and integrate multiscale multimodal mouse brain connectomes, including macro-scale mouse connectomes based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), Susceptibility Tensor Imaging (STI) data, and meso-scale mouse connectomes based on publicly available serial two-photon tomography data; 2) utilize multiscale structural connectomes for exploration of functional connectomics and circuitry dynamics, in particular, focusing on the fear memory system; and 3) design, develop and disseminate the structural and functional connectomics tools and resources to the brain mapping research community. To achieve the above goals, the investigators will design and apply innovative computational and informatics methodologies and approaches for multiscale mouse connectomics research. Specifically, both mesoscale and macroscale structural connectivity data will be used as follows. First, the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (ACA) will be used, which provides a comprehensive meso-scale mouse brain neuronal connectivity map via anterogradely traced axonal projections using serial two-photon tomography from over one thousand different injection sites. Second, at the macro-scale, the noninvasive diffusion tensor (DT) microimaging technique will be used to track global fiber connections in the whole mouse brain at the micron-scale spatial resolution. Subsequently data will be fused and integrated, to acquire the advantages of both meso-scale serial two-photon tomography data and macro-scale DT microimaging data when constructing and cross-validating multi-scale, multimodal mouse connectomes. Finally, these structural connectomes will be the basis for exploring functional connectomics and circuitry dynamics, thus significantly advancing the understanding of brain structure and function and their relationships. All of these structural and functional connectomics tools will be released to the brain science community at the project website: http://mbm.cs.uga.edu/"

Some work suggests that prejudice is most likely to play a role when racial appeals are subtle and covert. Other work contends that people use higher-level cognitive processes to inhibit prejudiced instincts and abide by egalitarian social norms when race is explicit. In other words, when people are encouraged to think more about racial policies, they should be able to recognize and restrain the racial biases that might otherwise influence their opinions. This study test the contention that higher-level cognitive processes reduce the role of prejudice against the research hypothesis that higher-level cognitive processes may in some instances reinforce and even exacerbate the role of prejudice because of conscious motivations to reject egalitarian norms. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Building on work in social neuroscience, this project uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to directly observe the neural mechanisms by which prejudice influences policy attitudes. A 2 (race: White vs. Black) x 2 (conscious awareness: implicit/non-conscious racial primes vs. explicit/conscious primes) within-subjects experiment is used to examine the impact of racial biases on support for various government assistance programs when the race of the programs' recipients is consciously versus subconsciously known. The PI hypothesizes that racial biases will be stronger when race is implicit, and that this relationship is mediated by increased activity in the amygdala and right insula and decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. However, the PI expects that racial biases will exist when race is explicit. If the key to diminishing the role of prejudice is to get people to think more about race, these biases will be due to a lack of controlled processing even when race is explicitly indicated by lower levels of activation in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and increased activity in the amygdala and right insula. However, if controlled processes sometimes lead to reinforcement of prejudice, there will be no relationship between racial biases in policy support and activation in the prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex."

These deposits also commonly contain some of the world's most important ore deposits.  Exposed deposits in South Africa, Greenland, USA, Canada, and Antarctica have led researchers to propose that the bigger the magma body, the faster it will crystallize.  While this might seem counter-intuitive (typically it is thought that more magma = hotter = harder to cool), the comparison of these exposures show that bigger magma chambers maintain a molten top that is always in contact with the colder crust; whereas smaller magma chambers insulate themselves by crystallizing at the margins.  The process is similar to the difference between a large cup of coffee with no lid, and a smaller cup of coffee held in a thermos.  The large unprotected cup of coffee will cool down much faster than that held in the thermos.  This research project of VanTongeren and Schoene will use previously collected rocks from the large (~8-9 km thick) Dufek Intrusion in Antarctica to precisely quantify how fast the magma chamber crystallized, and compare that rate to the much smaller magma chamber exposed in the Skaergaard Intrusion of E. Greenland.  The work is an important step towards improving our understanding of time-scales associated with the thermal and chemical evolution of nearly all magma chambers on Earth, which will ultimately lead to better predictions of volcanic hazards globally.  The work will also yield important insights into the timescales and conditions necessary for developing vast magmatic ore deposits, which is essential to the platinum and steel industries in the USA and abroad.<br/><br/>Based on observations of solidification fronts in six of the world's most completely exposed layered mafic intrusions, it was recently proposed that bigger magma chambers must crystallize faster than small magma chambers.  While this is initially counter-intuitive, the hypothesis falls out of simple heat balance equations and the observation that the thickness of cumulates at the roofs of such intrusions is negatively proportional to the size of the intrusion. In this study, VanTongeren and Schoene will directly test the hypothesis that bigger magma chambers crystallize faster by applying high precision U-Pb zircon geochronology on 5-10 samples throughout the large Dufek Intrusion of Antarctica.   Due to uncertainties in even the highest-precision ID-TIMS analyses, the Dufek Intrusion of Antarctica is the only large layered mafic intrusion on Earth where this research can be accomplished.  VanTongeren and Schoene will place the geochronological measurements of the Dufek Intrusion into a comprehensive petrologic framework by linking zircon crystallization to other liquidus phases using mineral geochemistry, zircon saturation models, and petrologic models for intrusion crystallization.  The research has the potential to radically change the way that we understand the formation and differentiation of large magma bodies within the shallow crust.  Layered intrusions are typically thought to cool and crystallize over very long timescales allowing for significant differentiation of the magmas and reorganization of the cumulate rocks.  If the 'bigger magma chambers crystallize faster hypothesis' holds this could reduce the calculated solidification time scales of the early earth and lunar magma oceans and have important implications for magma chamber dynamics of active intraplate volcanism and long-lived continental arcs.  Furthermore, while the Dufek Intrusion is one of only two large layered intrusions exposed on Earth, very little is known about its petrologic evolution.  The detailed geochemical and petrologic work of VanTongeren and Schoene based on analyses of previously collected samples will provide important observations with which to compare the Dufek and other large magma chambers."

For example, governments committed to large pension payments may have difficulty in meeting debt obligations. The results can be serious: for example, in the United States cities such as San Bernardino and Detroit have defaulted on their debts. Understanding the interplay between the incentive to accumulate debt and to promise entitlements is of crucial importance for understanding these actual and possible future episodes. In this project, the investigators use economic theory to analyze the political determinants of debt and entitlements and the relationship between these two components of governmental, fiscal obligations. <br/><br/>Despite a large literature on the political economy of debt and many papers on pensions, there is almost no work that studies the political economy of the interaction between debt and entitlements. This project aims at developing a new framework to fill this important gap. This research contrasts debt and entitlements in resource allocations: debt transfers resources across periods, whereas entitlements directly target the future allocation of resources. The investigators introduce the study of entitlements into a dynamic political economy models, and analyze the impact of entitlements on debt. The research also examines how the levels of debt and entitlements change as the persistence of political power changes, or as the political system becomes more unstable. The project further investigates the determinants and the consequences of the joint growth in government debt and entitlements since the 1970s. Moreover, this research develops a novel way to evaluate fiscal rules that constrain the growth of debt and entitlements."

The purpose of this workshop is to communicate the foundations and advances in research in key cutting-edge areas at the interface of statistical physics and biology, by means of lecture, discussion and dialogue amongst junior and advanced researchers. The unifying theme of this workshop is quantitative laws emerging in ecosystems, but a more general aim is to provide a wide perspective on the connections of this discipline with cellular physiology on one side and to complex systems on the other. The workshop will provide the necessary methodological tools and perspectives to enable a junior researcher to understand and perform cutting-edge research in these areas. It will primarily target PhD students and postdocs with a physics or mathematics background, but it is open to anyone with background in (evolutionary) genomics, (evolutionary) biology, bioinformatics, ecology, who is interested in quantitative work. The workshop is divided in two themes, centered on results, discoveries and methods at the interface of statistical physics and biology in the areas of (1) physiology to ecology and (2) interaction structures to collective behavior. <br/><br/>The discovery of recurring, quantitative patterns in biological systems across living systems from scales of molecules to ecosystems has led to the increasing development of an interface field between statistical physics and biology. This interface is enabled by the meaningful involvement of both physicists and bioscientists, focusing on relevant problems and leveraging theoretic methods from non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory, network theory, and large-scale simulation. Over 15 international speakers with expertise in the physics of living systems will develop foundational lectures as well as advanced research topics to engage students and postdocs entering this emerging field in a workshop/school format. The workshop will be unique in its integration of detailed quantitative and physics-based methods into the core analysis of data and problems in applications areas including genomics, cell biology, microbiology, ecology evolution, immunology and virology. Funds will support approximately 10 US-based PhD candidates and postdoctoral scientists to participate in an international workshop at the interface between multiple disciplines, including statistical physics and the biosciences, with applications to genomics, cell biology, microbiology, ecology evolution, immunology and virology. Recruitment will be targeted broadly in the United States, including student-based associations specifically supporting the inclusion of under-represented groups in cutting-edge scientific programs."

This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional ""ion source"" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers."

The projects focus on multistep reaction cascades that merge nucleophilic reactivity with cationic electrocyclic reactions, and allow the execution of highly stereocontrolled cyclizations. This research is leading to a richer understanding of redox cyclizations which are initiated by hydride shift, cyclizations coupled to pyridine and furan dearomatization, and the execution of higher-order electrocyclizations, which are virtually unknown reactions. New strategies for achieving enantioselective electrocyclization are also being evaluated. The proposed research is directed toward both exploring new reactivity and the development of efficient, diastereo- and enantioselective methods that rapidly transform acyclic systems into bridged, fused, or spirocyclic small molecules.  The synthetic strategies are efficient and modular, typically carried out in an environmentally friendly fashion.  Small molecule targets of this research  have desirable physicochemical properties and occupy unique chemical space; these features often correlate to bioactivity and meet stated needs for improving the quality of compound collections for use in drug discovery programs. Efforts are also focused on further development of the Not Voodoo website, a resource that serves hundreds of organic experimental chemists each day."

The PIs will leverage data already collected on 4200 households in the MSFP-project area immediately before the 2015 earthquake in Nepal by revisiting the same households for post-disaster data collection to assess the impact of the intervention on the earthquake recovery efforts of households and communities. With this research, the PIs are able to answer questions about the vulnerability of different groups of households to earthquake and other disaster impacts, the key socio-economic and institutional characteristics that structured the effects of the earthquake, and whether individual or collective benefits from the sustainable development initiative better supported earthquake recovery efforts. By identifying the types of project-related benefits with stronger positive effects on household and community level coping capacity, the research will show how international development projects can enhance household and community resilience and support local efforts to cope with disasters more effectively. Data collection for the research will be carried out with the support of in-country partners.

The panel dataset will help address enduring questions of interest to political scientists, social scientists more generally, and interdisciplinary scholars interested in sustainable development, disaster recovery, governance, and impact evaluation. The question of whether individual or collective level efforts and support are more effective in enhancing incomes and welfare, coping with variable levels of unanticipated income and asset shocks, and the conditions under which individual or collective efforts are complementary or in competition addresses the very roots of the social-scientific enterprise. By casting the relationships between external interventions and local socio-economic changes in terms of individual vs. community level support and efforts, this research opens the doors to insights from disparate theoretical frameworks used in writings on sustainable development (e.g., around different forms of capitals, entitlements, and livelihoods), disaster recovery (e.g., around vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and resilience), and governance (e.g., around rules, expectations, and institutional analysis). This research will contribute to a new framework focusing on how public capacity-building interventions can be analyzed in terms of the effectiveness of individual vs. collective efforts and contributions in enabling recovery from natural disasters."

Levine of Michigan State University is developing new computational methods to model non-radiative recombination in semiconductor nanomaterials.  Non-radiative recombination is a fundamental process that converts electronic energy to heat, thus limiting the efficiencies of devices for solar energy conversion, light emission, and other applications.  The methods being developed provide an atom-by-atom, electron-by-electron mechanistic picture of this process, thus informing the design of future materials.  Specifically, the Levine group is applying these new theoretical models to elucidate the dynamics of electronically excited silicon nanoparticles, which show promise as light emitters for solid state displays, biological imaging, and solid state lasers. The Levine group is also working with local high school teachers to develop the High School Computational Chemistry Server (HiSoCCS), which freely serves research-grade computational chemistry capability via a user-friendly web-based interface.  HiSoCCS and associated curricular materials are made available for free to Michigan high schools.  <br/><br/>The Levine group's approach is based on the hypothesis that conical intersections, points of degeneracy between electronic states, are introduced by defects in the material, and that these intersections provide efficient pathways for non-radiative recombination.  A new fully quantum mechanical method for modeling dynamics near conical intersections, the diabatized Gaussians on adiabatic surfaces (DGAS) approximation, is being developed.  The DGAS wave function ansatz is designed to handle singularities in the first- and second-derivative nonadiabatic couplings that occur at conical intersections.  The DGAS method is being implemented for high performance parallel computers, and the resulting software will be made freely available to other scientists.  The broader impacts of this work include: a) the development of a new nonadiabatic molecular dynamics method capable of accurately modeling a wide range non-radiative processes, b) new open source software for modeling dynamics near conical intersections, c) a deeper understanding of non-radiative recombination in silicon nanomaterials, and d) new tools and materials that incorporate research grade calculations into the high school science curriculum."

Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture.  This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy.  This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap.  Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size.  Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects. Finally, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will conduct accelerated life testing. Independent life data, combined with a successful operating pilot line, will help secure private investment for commercialization."

This research aims to explain the extent and impact of these strategic communications campaigns. To do this, the project: (1) maps which organizations participate in specific national issue debates; (2) conducts an extended analysis of communications tools and tactics used in public contexts for purposes of influence; and (3) examines the viewpoints and motivations guiding the actors who carry out these activities. The project considers the political contests and the coordination of resources among a wide variety of actors, including corporations, trade associations, research institutes, regulatory bodies, advocacy organizations, and governmental and non-governmental organizations over a 27-year period from 1988-2015. This research supports efforts to increase the role of the behavioral sciences in the federal government's policy development and implementation. This research informs policy makers about the complex processes of interaction that are part of the design and development of policy, and thus contribute to policy makers' ability to better engage businesses and the public in the development and implementation of government policy. It also contributes to multiple areas of research in sociology, political science and media studies.<br/><br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to critically inquire into the extent, influence, and impact of professional advocacy campaigns on debates in the public sphere. The research will explain the extent and impact of strategic communications campaigns on political and public responses to specific policy efforts. To achieve this goal, the project maps the organization of one specific public policy area and analyzes the factors that influence its shape over time. The researchers conduct an extended analysis of communications tools and tactics used in public contexts for purposes of influence. The researchers also carry out extended field observations and interviews to develop a situated understanding of the viewpoints, motivations, and schemes guiding the actors who carry out these activities.  Combining methods from sociology and communication studies, the researchers will (a) apply a macro-level network analysis to map which organizations have been featured in this issue arena between 1988 and 2015, what functions they serve, and how media and government forums help to establish each organization's level of prominence and legitimacy; (b) gather organizational characteristics to define and analyze the factors that drive the nature, extent, and impact of professional advocacy in this issue area (meso-level analysis); (c) conduct semi-structured interviews and observations at major industry events to assess the motives and rationales of the actors who create information and influence campaigns in this issue arena (micro-level analysis). The research contributes to understanding how social networks and institutional arrangements shape participants' understandings and thinking about policy issues. The research can assist scholars, policy advocates, and policymakers in developing better communications strategies that target particular publics and lead to more efficacious policy development."

An isotope of the element beryllium, 10Be, is produced in the atmosphere by high-energy protons (cosmic rays) that enter Earth's atmosphere from space.  It is removed from the atmosphere by settling or by scavenging by rain or snowfall.  Hence, concentrations of 10Be in snow at the South Pole reflect the production rate of 10Be in the atmosphere.  Because the rate of production of 10Be over Antarctica depends primarily on the strength of the Sun's magnetic field, measurements of 10Be in the South Pole ice core will provide a record of changes in solar activity.  The South Pole ice core will reach an age of 40,000 years at the bottom.  The project will result in measurements of 10Be at annual resolution for the last 100 years and selected periods in the more distant past, such as the Maunder Minimum, a period during the late 17th century during which no sunspots were observed, or the last glacial cold period, about 20,000 years ago.  A climate model that can simulate the production of 10Be in the atmosphere, it's transport through the atmosphere, and its deposition at the snow surface in Antarctica will be used to aid in using the 10Be data to determine past changes in solar activity from decadal to millennial scale, and in turn to evaluate the role of the Sun in Earth?s climate from a new perspective.<br/><br/>The production of 10Be in Earth's atmosphere results from the spallation of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere by cosmic rays.  Cosmic ray variations in the high latitudes are primarily modulated by solar variability. Time-series records of 10Be from ice cores are therefore important for deriving variations in solar activity through time, which is fundamental to understanding climate variability. Deposition of 10Be to the ice surface is also influenced by variability in atmospheric circulation and deposition processes, and South Pole is the best available location for minimizing the influence of variable atmospheric circulation on 10Be deposition. To date, only one record of 10Be exists from South Pole; that record is widely used in solar forcing estimates used in climate models, but covers only the last millennium and ends in CE 1982.  We will obtain 10Be concentration measurements in a 1500-m, 40000-year long ice core from the South Pole.  This will extend the existing record both further back in time and forward to the present, providing overlap with the modern instrumental record of solar and climate variability. High resolution (annual to biannual) measurements will be made in targeted areas of interest, including the last 100 years, the Maunder Minimum (CE 1650-1715), and the last glacial maximum. The novel data will be used in conjunction with climate model experiments that incorporate 10Be production, transport, and deposition physics. Together, data and modeling will create an updated record of atmospheric 10Be production and hence of solar activity."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a leading cause of injury, particularly in young adult populations, and is associated with declines in emotional well-being. Despite the importance of the topic, there are few prior studies of how to decrease IPV. Those studies have been short-term and their explicit links to treatment programs has generally been limited to the emphases of these programs.  The current study will provide a perspective on continuity and change in the experience of IPV over the different stages of life, and investigate the role of social experiences as influences on what causes changes in these types of behaviors.  Most theories of change highlight the importance of the individual's own motivation and receptivity as key components of the change process.  Unlike those studies, this study's focus on potentially malleable social factors will provide new insights about specific social and environmental influences that serve as catalysts for behavioral changes. Knowledge about these linkages has the potential to inform the design of more effective prevention and intervention efforts targeting this serious public health problem.  <br/><br/>Using a life-course perspective, the study will build on a five-wave longitudinal investigation of a large, diverse sample of young men and women interviewed first as adolescents, and later as they have navigated the transition to adulthood (Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study).  At each interview, information was collected about IPV perpetration, as well as about family, peer, romantic partner and neighborhood experiences and influences.   The research will follow-up for an additional assessment all those respondents who reported using violence within the context of an intimate relationship during the course of the study (n=403).  Specific objectives are to:  a) document patterns of persistence and ""desistance"" of these behaviors, b) investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with the process of making and sustaining positive changes, and c) identify social and individual factors that distinguish desisters and those who continue this negative pattern within their relationships.  The relatively long time gap between assessments (5 years) will permit an examination of sustained behavior change, as distinguished from the relatively common phenomenon of temporary lulls.  In addition to the online structured data collection effort, the researchers will complete in-depth qualitative interviews with a subset of male and female respondents who vary in the character of their experiences with violence (n=85).  This mixed method approach will permit a comprehensive examination of the complex interplay of social experiences and individual-level subjective changes as factors associated with the successful cessation of this form of interpersonal violence. This research contributes to scholarship about desistance from crime and contributes to the design of more effective programs to prevent and intervene in intimate partner violence."

Professor Michl and his students are examining the nature of bonding in electronically excited states of chains of silicon atoms. These studies have practical implications for understanding fatigue in amorphous silicon solar cells exposed to ultraviolet radiation as well as understanding conductivity in materials comprised of silicon chains. The project is providing opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers interested in lasers, in the interaction of light with matter, and in international science. Emphasis is being placed on attracting students to STEM fields, including those from groups that are presently underrepresented. <br/><br/>The current understanding of electron delocalization in saturated molecules such as oligosilanes and polysilanes (silicon analogs of saturated hydrocarbons) lags far behind that in conjugated pi-electron systems. Geometrical distortions induced in peralkylated oligosilane chains by light absorption are particularly intriguing. Fluorescence reveals that they are negligible in long chains and very pronounced in chains containing fewer than about seven silicon atoms. Calculations suggest that the distortions can be described as a transformation of one or two of the silicon atoms from the normal tetrahedral to trigonal bipyramidal geometry, in which silicon used five ""valence"" orbitals instead of the usual four. Such expansion of the silicon valence shell would have fundamental importance for bonding theory. Professor Michl's group is attempting to verify the theoretical prediction experimentally, using vibrational spectroscopy of the short-lived excited species. The same methods of transient vibrational spectroscopy are useful for other photophysical problems, in particular in the investigation of materials known to undergo efficient singlet fission, such as the higher polyacenes and derivatives of isobenzofuran. The work involves continuing international collaborations, providing undergraduate students a research experience, and giving classroom demonstrations to high school students."

In particular, climate model simulations suggest that the westerly jet streams found at upper levels in the middle latitudes will shift towards the poles, so that the mean Northern Hemisphere jet stream will migrate northward, with a corresponding southward shift for its the Southern Hemisphere counterpart.  These shifts are small but consequential, as patterns of rainfall and storminess in the middle latitudes are determined in large part by the positions of the jet streams.  <br/><br/>The poleward shift of jet streams as a consequence of greenhouse warming is a robust feature of global warming simulations and has been a research topic since at least 2005, but the seasonality and geography of the response has not yet been fully explored.  Preliminary work for this project shows that in the Southern Hemisphere the largest shift is in the Fall (March to May), followed by Summer (December to February), Winter (June to August), and Spring (September to November). In the North Atlantic the order is, from largest to smallest, Fall (September to November), Summer (June to August), Spring (March to May), and Winter (December to February). The ordering is again different in the North Pacific, with Fall leading by a large margin followed by Winter, Spring, and Summer. By now several theories have been proposed to explain why the jets shift poleward in an year-round, longitudinally averaged sense, but none of these theories provides a clear intuition for the seasonality (i.e. why the shift is largest in Fall) or the regional variations. <br/><br/>Research under this award consists of analysis of observational data from reanalysis products and simulations of future climate from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and the Large Ensemble archive of simulations using the Community Earth System Model.  This analysis is followed by numerical experiments using models of varying levels of complexity, intended to isolate and study possibly physical mechanisms leading seasonally and geographically varying jet shifts.  One issue to be considered is that the pattern of greenhouse warming generally includes a deep tropospheric warming maximum in the tropics together with surface trapped warming near the poles (referred to as polar amplification). The jet shifts can be regarded as a combined response to the tropical and polar influences, which are likely to have opposing effects and very different seasonalities.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest due to the strong impacts of jet shifts on local climate, for instance a northward shift of jet streams could cause drying in the region downwind of the present-day jet location accompanied by excessive rain and snow to the north.  In addition, the project will support and train two students, thereby contributing to the future workforce in this research area. The PI and her students will also organize a special session at an annual geosciences meeting to publicize results of the study and encourage further investigation of the topic."

The students will explore a novel framework based on the regular Fokker-Planck equation (which describes diffusion driven by forces and random Brownian motion) to determine the importance of inertial effects for a protein.  Students working on the fourth project will be studying a variety of inverse problems and solutions based on algebraic and analytic algorithms.

Humans act as sensors in these scenarios when they contribute data (either directly or via sensors they own) that a CPS application can use. Using humans as sensors (commonly known as social sensing or crowdsensing) is an emerging paradigm, which provides unprecedented opportunities to sense the physical world in an inexpensive, versatile and scalable manner. However, these benefits are based on the assumption that the human-sensed data are reliable, but this is not always the case. In order for social sensing to become a viable component in CPS feedback loops, there is a critical need to understand the correctness of collected observations from unreliable individuals. This challenge is referred to as reliable social sensing. The objective of this project is to develop a new Reliable Social Sensing Model (RSSM) and system prototype, which enables correct reconstruction of states of physical environment from unreliable human sensors.<br/><br/>This project leverages and innovates techniques in estimation theory and CPS to fill a critical gap in the rigorous analysis of human-sensed information, thereby providing a reliable social sensing component to build robust CPS with humans-in-the-loop. This project contains three key components. First, a RSSM will be developed to formally reason about the correctness of collective human observations and accurately assess the quality of analysis results. Second, a new reliable social sensing system prototype will be built to integrate the proposed RSSM with the state-of-the-art data processing techniques to handle different types of human sensed data. Third, by evaluating the proposed model and system through a real world social sensing application, the project will effectively validate the correctness of the RSSM and provide new insights into modeling humans as sensors for future research.  <br/><br/>The success of the project and follow-up work inspired by it could lead to a paradigm shift in CPS with human-in-the-loop by explicitly incorporating rigorous accuracy assessment into the development of new theories, systems and applications that rely on the collective observations from massive human sensors. The proposal is timely due to the increasing interests in social networks, big data, and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as the proliferation of computing artifacts that interact with or monitor the physical world. This research project will also contribute to the curriculum of CPS and Social Sensing courses, and will engage undergraduate and graduate students in STEM disciplines and from underrepresented groups."

This project focuses on developing methods to sensitively detect dynamic changes in two broad categories of 3D chromatin features: (1) sub-megabase topologically associating domains exhibiting a block structure, and (2) precise long-range interactions between two distant genomic loci, leading to looping out of the intervening genomic DNA. Both parametric and non-parametric normalization approaches for elucidating these features will be explored and benchmarked.

Many linkages between causes of changes, and effects in complex marine ecosystems, specially those involving top level consumers as well as their predators and prey, remain poorly understood, largely due to a lack of feasible ways to observe many marine species that spend most of their life at sea or under water. To overcome this difficulty, a new monitoring device was developed under previous IDBR funding that enables the collection of predation, survival and female reproductive data by a single instrument, no matter where the host might move to, feed, breed, and die. Building on the success of this new telemetry device that provided the first direct at-sea determination of predation rates on a large marine predator from satellite-linked transmissions initiated only after the death of the host, this project will improve the capabilities and enable the production of the Life History Transmitter, for collaborative studies on many top level species of interest and concern. This will enable researchers from a broad community of potential users to conceive and apply new experimental designs to provide a major surge in our understanding of marine ecosystems, food chain linkages, as well as consumer driven and resource driven effects within the many unresolved knowledge gaps."

Prior work by the PI has led to the development of a sophisticated exoskeleton for upper limb rehabilitation, called HARMONY. This PFI:AIR-TT award will support a novel controls framework for HARMONY that holds potential to improve the rehabilitation outcomes of not only stroke patients but also those with upper extremity neurological and musculoskeletal impairments. Currently there is only one robot commercially available for delivering physical therapy to the upper body. HARMONY offers improvements over this system through the following features: i) HARMONY can power entire shoulder movement; ii) HARMONY is bimanual, so it can simultaneously deliver therapy to both arms, which opens up possibilities for novel bimanual therapy; and iii) HARMONY allows for customization of the robot's force is at each joint which is critical for physical therapy. <br/><br/>This project will develop a new controls framework that ensures patient involvement and provides the appropriate amount of assistance so that subjects can complete the desired task. To achieve this objective, the following two specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1) Develop and test novel controls framework for multi-DOF, bimanual human-exoskeleton interactions and Aim 2) Demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive controllers through experiments with healthy subjects. The team, involving two participants with business and commercialization expertise, will advance understanding of the business aspects, including IP, regulatory issues and market need, and will generate a commercialization plan.<br/><br/>With mentoring from personnel with business and commercialization experience and the focus on developing a commercialization plan, this project will create a unique opportunity for educating the academic participants in the process of translating basic research into deployed technology. Successful completion of this project will aid in the development of the next generation of innovators and business leaders."

Plant-feeding are the most diverse group of animals, including a quarter of all named species. Yet little is known about how insects evolve to feed on plants from other types of diets, or how insects evolve to target specific kinds of plants. This project will study how the smell receptors and underlying genetics of these flies have changed over evolutionary time as their diet switches from yeast to plants. It will determine the changes in smell receptors that allow the switch to new diets and how the underlying genetics shifts to target new host plants. This increased understanding of the evolution of the sense of smell will inform our general understanding of changes in ecological interactions. This research may furthermore provide insights that allow manipulation of insect food choice. It therefore has the potential to broadly impact society through applications to agriculture, where insects are major crop pests, and human health since insects frequently spread disease.<br/><br/>This study will investigate the evolution of olfaction (sense of smell) after a niche change by comparing the olfactory systems of Scaptomyza flava and Scaptomyza pallida. These two fly species are closely related but differ in diet. S. flava is a true herbivore feeding on mustard plants, while S. pallida retains the more ancestral diet of microbes. Gas chromatography (GC) -electroantennographic detection (EAD) will be used to differentiate which volatile compounds (smells) produced by leaves of host species the flies can detect. This technique divides a stream of leaf volatiles into two identical streams. One stream is sent into a GC detector for identification by essentially artificially smelling the compound. The other stream is aimed at a fly where EAD will determine if the compound is detectable naturally by determining if the compound triggers a response in single nerve cell. Leaf volatiles that are detected by herbivorous flies will thereby be identified and compared to those detected by flies that feed on microbes. The volatiles identified by GC-EAD as differentiating the two species will then be used as baits in olfactory assays where four calibrated airstreams containing different volatiles are fed into the corners of a square arena. The attraction to each plant volatile will then measured to determine if the species behavior matches their detection profile. Finally, genes that appear to be important in differentiating these two species will be engineered into a model organism Drosophila melanogaster to test if the genes effect on food choice is fully understood."

This I-Corps team has developed processes to produce natural ferulate from non-food biomass. Natural ferulate is important to the Flavor and Fragrance Industry as it is used to produce the highly desired natural vanilla. Vanilla is one of the most important products sold in the Flavor and Fragrance Industry. The global flavor and fragrance chemicals market is a $20 billion industry with continuing annual growth rate of 4.3%.  At the present time, vanilla represents around $1 billion of this global market with a 13,000 metric ton production volume. Naturally derived vanilla is an important segment of the market and constitutes 2,400 metric tons of this volume. Successful commercialization of this technology would provide a route for domestic production of renewable and sustainable natural vanillin from non-food biomass sources.<br/><br/>This team has developed proprietary technologies for selective upgrading of wood lignin to high value chemicals used in the flavor and fragrance industries. A new application of this technology seeks to produce natural ferulate from biomass, while simultaneously working to better understand the customer needs through the I-Corps discovery process. The goal of the discovery process is to validate the hypothesis that natural ferulate produced from non-food biomass will be a valuable product desired by producers of natural vanillin. The scope of the project includes over 100 interviews with relevant industry contacts to test the hypothesis. Methods employed will focus on interviews with members of the entire value chain including; biomass suppliers, producers of ferulate and vanillin, flavor and fragrance compounders and formulators, and distributors. This discovery work will provide essential data and understanding as the project advances in the prototype stage. Prototype scale-up will be conducted through a combination of already constructed in-house reactors, and will also utilize toll manufacturing. Data from the prototype scale-up will be used in combination with the data generated through I-Corps interviews to provide great insight into the commercial viability of the proposed process and recommendations for further scaling."

Two decades of ecological experiments and theory have clearly demonstrated that biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem functioning, such that biological communities containing more species have higher levels of ecosystem function. However, virtually all of this research has been conducted at small scales and under experimentally controlled conditions that may not represent real-world ecosystems. This project will bridge the gap between the extensive knowledge scientists have developed about the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship at smaller experimental scales, and the largely unknown role of biodiversity in driving ecosystem services at the scale of real-world landscapes. The researchers will study the pollination delivered to native wildflowers by wild insect pollinators, to determine how many pollinator species are required to provide sufficient pollination to all study sites as spatial scale increases from a single plant community to an entire landscape. Specifically, they will test contrasting predictions about how the number of species required to provide adequate ecosystem services in the real world could be either more, or fewer, than that found in experiments. The results of this study will have important applications for the management of ecosystem services as well as for biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>This will be the first study to investigate how two well-known features of communities, turnover in species composition across space, and species dominance (the prevalence of a few common species and many rare ones), jointly determine the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem services at real-world scales. In order to measure real-world complexity while simultaneously controlling real-world noise, the researchers will use experimental, multi-species arrays of native plants placed throughout a 1600 km2 area as a standardized method for sampling wild pollinator communities and the pollination function they provide. Rarefaction models will be used to determine how the number of pollinator species that are important to pollination changes with increasing spatial scale, and null models will be used to remove, and thus quantify, the effect of dominance relative to that of species turnover."

NSF Geosciences previously supported the design, construction and initial operations of COCONet (Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network) to promote advances in in tectonic and weather hazards research in the pan-Caribbean region (EAR-1042906).  COCOnet development represents a partnership with 28 sovereign nation and 41 distinct administrative entities in the circum-Caribbean region.  A network of over 80 continuously operating Global Positioning System and meteorological observation stations (GPS/Met) that were procured and deployed or refurbished with support from the COCONet construction awards is now nearly complete.  In addition, the managing institution, UNAVCO, was able to negotiate with Caribbean partners for the ingestion of an additional 62 GPS data streams engaging Caribbean country regional data centers in the process.  All data are publically accessible via the UNAVCO Data archive.  Most recently over 80% of all COCONet sites were delivering data to the UNAVCO archive and 45 of those stations deliver in near real time and at high rate (1 Hz).  The COCONet data support: 1) constraints on the tectonics of the entire Caribbean region; 2) the enhancement of atmospheric observations that can be used to test and extend climate models; 3) improvement of the analysis of local geodetic measurements by providing access to an integrated backbone of reference stations; and 4) improved likelihood of forecasting natural hazards that pose such a significant threat to the region.<br/><br/>The focus of the workshop presentations and discussions will be on the scientific results, current status and operational requirements, identification of possible pathways to sustain operations into the future, and international capacity building opportunities afforded by the COCONet GPS/Met network.  The proposed workshop will bring together scientists, government agency and emergency management officials to discuss the scientific achievements and operational success of COCONet to date, this will include scientists and students from several Caribbean region countries including representatives that are now in charge of established regional COCONet data centers.  The workshop will address issues such as hardware and software standardization and will have focused talks highlighting regional partner experiences on the status of the network in their country and how they are planning to maintain and operate COCONet systems.  Regional Data Center (RDC) directors from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Barbados will present the status of the data centers in their country and ideas about how to maintain these regional centers for the long-term.  The workshop will engage student participation from Caribbean and U.S. academic institutions.  This grant is made with support from multiple Programs in the Geosciences Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Not only will this assist in diagnosing diseases, it will also help to monitor treatments and allow for a quick change in treatment options if required. A better way to tackle these challenges is to work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers. The team will likely develop better solutions if they are not only diverse in training, but also diverse in culture. For this reason, we will take a diverse group of students, ranging from Michigan Tech graduate students, undergraduates from Michigan Tech and other universities, and community college students, and have them work for the summer in Denmark.  Aarhus University is a world-class research institution working on health diagnostics for the future. The science and engineering students will be joined in this experience by a communications student. This student will assist the technical students in the creation of videos that describes their experience in the lab and the projects they contributed to. This is a shift is how scientific education is often taught. This project will break the cycle of engineers and scientists only speaking to one another and help open the lines of communication to show the public what is happening behind the laboratory doors. The technical students will greatly benefit from the exposure to technical communication while the communication student will learn more about working with technical researchers. The end product will be 18 highly trained students who will have increased opportunity to explore technical careers while producing videos that explain to the public the importance of the research they conducted. The technical students will also create and present posters at a local technical conference that highlight the research conducted. <br/><br/>Today?s global health challenges require interdisciplinary knowledge, international research collaboration, and intercultural communication competencies.  This project will provide international research experiences for an interdisciplinary cohort of students focused on early detection of malaria and cancer though an established collaboration with Michigan Tech and Aarhus University in Denmark.  The goal is to create scientists and engineers who can creatively and collaboratively solve future problems in health diagnostics and beyond, and we strive to increase the students? perspective through this international experience.  Our team consists of a biologist, pathologist, mechanical engineer and chemical engineers.  This project will explore new disease biomarkers, determine the clinical relevance of the biomarkers and design new microdevices that will improve clinical adoption of the new technology.  Over a three-year period, the proposed summer international research experiences will prepare, annually, a cohort of five diverse science and engineering students to engage in an eight-week global biosensor research experience and one technical communications student to document and disseminate the research efforts.  A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of a technical communications student.  This will provide student researchers with an education in scientific communication, which is often lacking in current scientific education, but is extremely important for the future of scientific funding and public rapport in the U.S.  The incorporation of a technical communications student will synergistically teach the scientific students the difficulties and importance of scientific communication to the public.  It is expected that all the participants will return as more engaged students with an increased propensity for new ideas and collaboration.  In addition, the students will engage other students through poster sessions of their experience and professionally produced online videos that will provide the motivation for others to seek out international research opportunities."

One ubiquitous finding about these machine learning tasks is that in most real-world applications the learning tasks are closely related to each other. Moreover, human experts in many domains can usually provide indispensable domain knowledge describing how these models are related. Maximally exploiting such knowledge is critical in building high quality machine learning models. This project will develop effective and efficient interactive algorithms and tools (including open source software) to enable knowledge discovery by integrating domain knowledge of task relatedness from human experts. The algorithms and tools developed in this project will directly impact biomedical informatics as they will be used to build disease progression models. The educational component of this project includes developing a new curriculum that incorporates research into the classroom and provides students from under-represented groups with opportunities to participate in research.<br/><br/>Leveraging task relatedness, multi-task learning (MTL) simultaneously learns all related learning tasks and performs knowledge transfer among the tasks to improve the quality of models from all the tasks. Although there are numerous studies for MTL that assume different types of task relatedness, limited progress has been made in incorporating domain knowledge in MTL. This project will advance MTL by: (1) developing algorithms for knowledge aware multi-task feature learning which exploit domain knowledge of features to guide the selection of joint features from the learning tasks; (2) developing algorithms for knowledge aware multi-task relationship learning which utilize domain knowledge of tasks to guide the learning of task relationships; and (3) developing efficient and scalable optimization algorithms to facilitate effective interactive visualization.

Cave minerals are capable of recording these processes because as they grow they record the chemistry of groundwater seeping into the cave through time. Carbon isotope ratios in cave minerals have the potential to provide essential clues as to how Earth's carbon cycle responded to past climate changes. However, though carbon isotope ratios in cave minerals are easily measured, they can be difficult to interpret given the number of factors that influence cave systems. The goal of this research is to use observations of water chemistry variability from the surface through the soil and into a Tennessee cave system to construct and verify a computer model that simulates the transport and reaction of carbon in the Earth's surface. This software can be used to question the environmental factors that are most important for controlling carbon isotopes in cave systems. Through this research, a new and versatile computational capability will emerge to help determine how climate is recorded in cave minerals. This will provide a deeper understanding of carbon cycle response to past climate changes and thus help to make critical predictions for the future. This project is led by two early career female scientists and will involve the training of two new Ph.D. students and at least two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Carbon isotope records of speleothem hold great potential for reconstructing past changes in the Earth's surface response to climate change, such as transient vegetation, soil respiration, carbon stabilization in deep soils, and/or chemical weathering in the epikarst. Yet, because of their inherent complexity, these data often go unpublished and un-interpreted, despite being regularly collected during more common oxygen isotope investigations. By sampling waters from soils and drip sites within a cave on a multi-year timescale, it is possible to observe how seasonal environmental signals are translated and modified along heterogeneous flow paths in the soil and epikarst. However, interpreting time-averaged speleothem records representing climate changes occurring over years to centuries requires integration of observational data and simulation studies that provide a temporal bridge between long and short-term processes. The current research tackles this problem through the development of a carbon isotope enabled reactive transport model that is calibrated and tested in a karst system, providing a novel tool for the investigation and interpretation of speleothem carbon isotope records. This will be accomplished through modification of the reactive transport model CrunchTope to accommodate three-isotope systems to simulate stable and radioactive carbon isotope fractionation and decay within a multicomponent reaction network. Validation of the model for karst settings will be accomplished using data from an ongoing environmental monitoring program at Blue Spring Cave in Tennessee. Once functionality of the CrunchTope model has been demonstrated for the Blue Spring karst environment, this approach can be expanded to investigate carbon isotope systematics and speleothem carbon isotope records from a variety of cave settings and climate regimes. Looking beyond carbon, this model will provide a versatile tool for evaluating the partitioning and resultant distribution of numerous isotope systems in karst settings (e.g. Calcium, Magnesium, Strontium, Uranium), and thus the model will facilitate development and interpretation of a variety of cutting-edge paleoclimate proxy records from cave environments."

In 2014 alone, there were 60 proposed RTW bills in 27 states, and the passage of RTW laws in Michigan (2012) and Wisconsin (2014) has led many to question how regressive labor laws could be passed in heavily unionized states. Ultimately the question being asked is embedded in the larger question of who or what influences the policies enacted by the state? Within the field of sociology, there are four distinct theories that attempt to answer this general question: (1) pluralism, (2) elite theory, (3) instrumentalist-Marxism, and (4) state-centered institutionalism. The increasingly heated battle between labor and business interests in state legislatures provides a perfect case for testing the relative merit of four dominant sociological theories of power.  The purpose of this dissertation is to answer the following questions: (1) What factors account for the variation in state legislators? actions?  (2) What factors account for the fate of proposed collective bargaining bills in state legislatures? <br/><br/>This study examines the proposal and passage of all state-level collective bargaining bills during the 2011-2012 legislative session. The analysis combines five unique datasets. The first dataset consists of data on every bill related to collective bargaining proposed among all state legislatures in the 2011-2012 legislative session (N=2,068).  The second has data on the financial contributions to state-level elections in 2008 and 2010.  The third has information on state and constituent characteristics from the 2010 census.  The fourth contains data on state level institutional differences, such as differences in rules about vetoing, majority rule, and committee appointment procedures. The fifth dataset will collect publicly available data on the corporate business ties of all state legislators in 2012.  These data will be used to study two outcomes: First, by using each legislator as a unit of analysis, the investigator plans to explain variation in legislators? bill proposals. Second, by using each proposed bill as the unit of analysis, generalized ordered logistic regression models will predict the outcome of each bill: (1) proposed, (2) failed in first chamber, (2) failed in second chamber, (3) vetoed, or (4) passed into legislation. Both analyses will analyze all four theoretical models."

Researchers and clinicians alike are turning to genomics to help guide diagnosis, drug discovery, and treatment in order to combat a variety of diseases in a much more targeted and effective manner. Time-to-diagnosis and time-to-treatment place a premium on removing end-to-end bottlenecks. Given the increasing scale (and costs) of analysis - performance optimization must also be combined with cost optimization. And, with a rapidly evolving state-of-the-art in terms of algorithms, applications and technologies, critical expertise must be assembled to deliver highly advanced, well integrated, and easy-to-use solutions. Current approaches have proven to be too rigid, slow, complex and costly. They require substantial investments of time, money and hard to find expertise, that goes well beyond the capabilities of many clinical organizations. This I-Corps team seeks to provide a flexible, scalable and optimized genomics analysis solution in order to meet these critical requirements for diagnostic labs in hospital settings, genetic testing service providers, translational medicine institutes and pharmaceutical R&D groups.

The workshop is part of an annual activity spearheaded by the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC). The workshop is aimed at exposing graduate students and junior researchers to recent progress in computational sciences, particularly in error estimation techniques utilized in a class of multi-physics and multi-scale problems inheriting various levels of uncertainty. The workshop is designed to be strongly interdisciplinary. Workshop presentations and lectures are a blend of colloquium type and more in-depth style, with the intention of allowing junior participants to gain knowledge that are potentially useful in their future endeavors, and at the same time giving more experienced participants ample opportunity to initiate research collaboration.<br/><br/>Any numerical approximation/simulation for solving mathematical problems contains some errors. These errors are often functionally dependent on some parameters associated with the method. Formally, a robust numerical method should exhibit a behavior in which the errors vanish in the limiting process associated with the parameters. A standard practice is to estimate the errors in terms of the parameters and some regularity assumptions of the original problems. Unfortunately, many applications prevent imposing those theoretical assumptions, thereby creating a need to monitor the errors in real time simulation. Having this availability will enhance the robustness of the approximation in the predictive simulation. Furthermore, a closely related aspect to error estimation is quantifying the uncertainty that can be present both in the original problem and in the techniques employed to approximate it. The appropriate strategy to tackle this is multifaceted, involving reliance on sophisticated mathematical and statistical tools. This workshop provides a forum for researchers to address all these issues.

Chemosynthetic microorganisms use the energy generated by oxidizing reduced inorganic chemicals contained in the vent fluids, like hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen gas, to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into cell material. By doing so, they effectively transfer the energy from a geothermal source to higher trophic levels, in the process supporting the unique and fascinating ecosystems that are characterized by high productivity - oases in the otherwise barren deep ocean landscape. While the general view of the functioning of these ecosystems is established, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the microbiology and biogeochemistry of these systems. Particularly lacking are studies measuring rates of microbial activity in situ, which is ultimately needed to understand production of these ecosystems and to assess their impact on global biogeochemical cycles. This project makes use of the Vent-Submersible Incubation Device (Vent-SID), a robotic micro-laboratory that was recently developed and tested in the field. This instrument makes it possible for the first time to determine rates of carbon fixation at both in situ pressures and temperatures, revolutionizing the way we conduct microbial biogeochemical investigations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. This is an interdisciplinary and collaborative effort between two US and foreign institutions, creating unique opportunities for networking and to foster international collaborations. This will also benefit two graduate students working in the project, who will get exposed to a wide range of instrumentation and scientific fields, facilitating their interdisciplinary education.  In collaboration with Dr. Nitzan Resnick, academic dean of The Sage School, an elementary school outreach program will be developed and a long-term partnership with the school established. Further, a cruise blog site to disseminate the research to schools and the broader public will be set up. The results will be the topic of media coverage as well as be integrated into coursework and webpages existing either in the PI's labs or at the institution.<br/><br/>This project is using a recently developed robotic micro-laboratory, the Vent-SID, to measure rates of chemoautotrophic production and to determine the relative importance of oxygen and nitrate in driving chemosynthesis at deep-sea hydrothermal vents at in situ pressures and temperatures and to tackle the following currently unresolved science objectives: 1) obtain in situ rates of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation, 2) obtain in situ nitrate reduction rate measurements, and 3) directly correlate the measurement of these processes with the expression of key genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism. Although recent data suggests that nitrate reduction either to N2 (denitrification) or to NH4+ (dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium) might be responsible for a significant fraction of chemoautotrophic production, NO3-reduction rates have never been measured in situ at hydrothermal vents. The researchers hypothesize that chemoautrophic growth is strongly coupled to nitrate respiration in vent microbial communities. During a cruise that will take place approximately 12 months into the project (~Feb 2017), the researchers will carry out a total of 4 deployments of the Vent-SID as well as ancillary sampling collection at the 946N to 953N segment of the East Pacific Rise. They will focus efforts on two diffuse-flow vent sites, ""Crab Spa"" and ""Teddy Bear"". ""Crab Spa"" is a diffuse flow vent site (T: 25C) that has been used as a model system to gain insights into chemoautotrophic processes and has been frequently sampled over the last several years. This vent site has been very well characterized, both geochemically and microbiologically, providing excellent background data for the proposed process oriented studies. ""Teddy Bear"" is a diffuse-flow site that was discovered in Jan 2014, and it has a lower temperature (T: 12C), making it a good comparative site. The researchers will perform a number of short duration time-course incubations to assess the role of different environmental parameters that have been identified as likely key variables (e.g., O2, temperature, NO3-), and to link these process rate measurements to the expression of functional genes using metatranscriptomic analyses. This study will be the first attempt to measure critical metabolic processes of hydrothermal vent microbial assemblages under critical in situ conditions and to assess the quantitative importance of electron donor and acceptor pathways in situ. In the future, it is envisioned that the Vent-SID will become a routine application by the oceanographic community for measuring time series rates of relevant metabolic processes at hydrothermal vents under in situ pressures and vent fluid temperatures."

The seemingly chaotic behavior of smoke trails from a cigarette or milk as it is poured into coffee is easily seen; indeed, turbulent flow was famously sketched by Leonardo da Vinci over half a millennium ago. Despite its conspicuousness, turbulence remains one of greatest enigmas of both theoretical and mathematical physics. Any small progress made in developing better mathematical underpinnings to the theory could lead to profound developments in the applied sciences. Characteristic to turbulence is a cascade to small scales: in hydrodynamic turbulence this corresponds to the formations of eddies that break up to form smaller eddies, whereupon the process repeats. The aim of this research project is to investigate the mathematical structures present in such a cascade. <br/><br/>The project is guided by two underlying goals: to better understand anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy in turbulence, and to develop stronger mathematical foundations for the theory of wave turbulence. Specifically, relating to the first goal, the investigator intends to work towards resolving a famous conjecture of Lars Onsager relating to the existence of weak solutions to the Euler equations whose kinetic energy is not conserved. The work will build on previously-developed convex integration schemes and will introduce new ideas unseen in any convex integration to date. With regard to the second goal, the investigator intends to develop new mathematical methods in order to better understand how heuristic derivations made in the physics literature can be made rigorous. A key aspect of this investigation will be the use of methods from analytic number theory in order to characterize resonant and quasi-resonant interactions, which are suspected to play a fundamental role in the non-linear dynamics of the regimes of wave turbulence under investigation."

Professor Birman is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Washington University in Saint Louis.  Prof. Birman's research interests revolve around chiral organic compounds: compounds whose structures exist as distinct mirror images called enantiomers. The two enantiomers of the same compound often display different biological activities, which becomes vitally important in the case of chiral pharmaceuticals.  The wrong enantiomer of a drug may have reduced pharmacological activity or even be toxic. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing methods for preparing chiral compounds in the form of single enantiomers. Selective catalysis, which is the main focus of research in the Birman group, is an economical and waste-free approach to accomplishing this goal. The present project aims to explore a new family of reactions using Birman's chiral catalysts, which previously were developed in the Birman group and are currently used by many researchers worldwide. These reactions provide access to new classes of chiral compounds that may find applications as drug development and biological studies. Prof. Birman's research program, which encompasses many areas of synthetic organic chemistry, is suited for educating students at all levels: graduate students involved in research, undergraduates receiving training in the Birman lab, and those students taking Advanced Organic Lab under his supervision.  In addition, Professor Birman's outreach activities in the public schools of Saint Louis are designed to spark the interest of elementary school students in science. <br/><br/>The overarching theme of the proposed project is the Lewis base-catalyzed enantioselective activation of thioesters. Specifically, the Birman group is developing an asymmetric catalytic rearrangement of alpha,beta-unsaturated thioesters into zwitterionic enolates, followed by a formal cycloaddition with pi-electrophiles. The resulting polycyclic structures, adorned with several stereocenters, are expected to be important in natural product synthesis and medicinal chemistry. These polycyclic products are difficult to access by other synthetic methods. In addition, the enantioselective alcoholysis of racemic thioesters is being explored, both in static and dynamic kinetic resolution mode.  Amidine-based enantioselective acylation catalysts previously developed in the Birman laboratory are employed to achieve both of these new transformations. The educational plan associated with this research program includes further development of the organic chemistry component of the undergraduate curriculum at Washington University and continued outreach to elementary/middle school students in the public schools of Saint Louis."

However, the power of such Big bioassay data has not been fully unleashed, particularly for the purposes of discovering novel knowledge and improving drug development. This is largely due to the fact that the exploration of a much larger space of bioassays has been fundamentally hindered by the less developed ability to identify and utilize the relations across bioassays. In this project, the PI and her team will develop novel computational methods and tools that can effectively explore a wide range of heterogeneous bioassays, identify experimentally unrevealed relations among them, and utilize the novel knowledge derived from them so as to improve compound prioritization. The research will bring scientific impacts and shed light on fully utilizing the existing wealth of Big Data, stimulating knowledge distillation in innovative manners, establishing visionary conceptual hypotheses and developing novel analytical techniques correspondingly. This research aims to solve critical problems in drug discovery through Big Data means, and has a great potential to improve drug candidate identification through accurate compound prioritization, and thus it will have far-reaching economic and societal impacts. <br/><br/>The PI and her team will develop a computational framework to produce better compound ranking for each bioassay. This framework will consist of a local structure learning component and a global structure learning component to discover and leverage the compound ranking within a bioassay and ranking relations across bioassays, respectively. They will also develop new methods to better rank compounds under a combination of criteria. In particular, they will solve compound ranking based on activity and selectivity simultaneously by leveraging ranking difference across bioassays. The research will be innovative, both in terms of employing original computational models and methods into important problems in drug discovery, and in terms of developing unique methodologies and computational techniques for core Computer Science research. For drug discovery, the research will provide novel perspectives and methodologies as to how researchers can utilize the large-scale experimental data to solve important problems in drug discovery. For core Computer Science, the research will contribute a new solution framework and methods spanning the areas of data mining and machine learning. Specifically, the research will lead to novel methods for boosting ranking performance by actively including additional data, incorporating relevant information within a regularized optimization framework, deploying iterative procedures and greedy strategies for large-scale problems with multiple simultaneous tasks, etc. All these methods are generalizable to a variety of other Computer Science applications.

Currently, such detection is performed on expensive, dedicated instruments that have low sensitivity and are not able to enrich. The strategy is to encapsulate the fluorescently-identified target molecules in thin oil shells so that they mimic cells, and then process them on sensitive and high-throughput cell-sorting instruments that are commonly available. By offloading the detection and enrichment to such machines, all that is required by researchers is a simple tool that encapsulates the molecules in thin oil shells. Applications made possible by high sensitivity and enrichment are numerous, from rare pathogen or cell detection to target capture of uncommon mutant sequences with the goal of downstream sequencing. Between the reduced cost and expansion of capabilities, this approach is likely to become a widely adopted method.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a deployable instrument that allows high-throughput, low-cost quantitation of DNA/RNA molecules in a sample by interfacing with existing flow cytometry instruments. The initial objective is to quickly engineer all the functionality desired in that final instrument into a rough alpha version. Its features will include reliable droplet generation from iteratively optimized hard-plastic microfluidic chips, and automation via an advanced fluid handling system with precise feedback control. The second objective is to build the actual beta version for customer trials. The beta version will replace most of the off-the-shelf parts with streamlined, custom engineering and focus on reducing size and cost while still improving function through more iterative chip optimization. The final objective is to use the beta instrument to optimize the protocols and reagents for several applications using customer samples and benchmarking. At the conclusion of the project, the goal is to have instruments at customer sites generating data."

The long-standing success of birds may be attributable in part to their unique reproductive physiology, which includes a specialized skeletal tissue deposited in the inner cavity of long bones known as medullary bone (MB). MB acts as a calcium reserve for the production of eggshells and was long thought to be a key reproductive adaptation unique to birds. However, the tissue has recently been purported to occur in a handful of extinct species, including both non-avian dinosaurs and dinosaurian relatives. Given the vast evolutionary distance across the groups in which MB has been tentatively identified (across lineages that diverged over 100 million years prior to the origin of birds), substantiation (or refutation) of MB in these taxa and a careful study of the chemical characteristics and microstructure of these skeletal tissues is a critical first step to determine the validity of these identifications and the evolutionary significance of this tissue. The proposed project will be transformative in developing an untested, independent proxy for chemically distinguishing MB in fossils, and a non-destructive means for identifying the microstructure of MB in the fossil record that can be used to explore reproductive life history and physiology of the bird lineage in deep time. Public outreach and education associated with this research will be conducted at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. <br/><br/>Medullary bone (MB) is an ephemeral, estrogen dependent, endosteal tissue lining the marrow cavity in extant avialans (birds). This specialized reproductive tissue is highly vascular histologically, exhibits a woven bone matrix, and is more densely mineralized than other bone types. Although originally considered a key avian adaptation, MB has since been identified in non-avian theropod and ornithopod dinosaurs, far removed phylogenetically from the direct lineage of extant avialans, and most recently outside of Dinosauria, in one of the clade's closest extinct relatives Pterosauria (non-dinosaurian flying reptiles). To date, identifications of MB in fossils have relied exclusively on structural comparisons (location, texture, distribution, and microstructure) with MB in birds by means of histological (destructive) sampling. However, MB in living birds can also be identified by its unique molecular signature because the tissue incorporates more non-collagenous proteins than cortical bone, and utilizes more sulfated glycosaminoglycans, particularly keratan sulfate, which is not present in cortical bone. This project will provide new information on chemical and microstructural variation in MB within extant avialans and will use these data to generate novel CT and histochemical techniques for identifying MB in the fossil record. This protocol will then be used to test the homology of published accounts of MB in extinct Archosauria, ultimately providing an informed phylogenetic context for the evolution of medullary bone and avian-specific reproductive physiology.

As digital technologies proliferate around the world, social science researchers increasingly have access to data that reflect granular and nuanced patterns of human interactions and social behavior.  This is a change from traditional research on social networks, which requires expensive and time-consuming survey modules.  Given the cost of collecting network data from surveys, most knowledge about the role of individuals' social networks in behavior comes from data about relatively small networks observed at a single time period.  In contrast, the investigators will apply their methods to data that are unsolicited and arise as electronic logs generated through social media and communication services.  In such instances, interactions occur in real time and involve millions of unique individuals.  Examining such data provides insights into the patterns of day-to-day interactions that shape individuals' social context.  The techniques to be developed will model rich network structure with intuitive and simplified representations that will make them easier to integrate into social science research.  Open-source software will be made available through CRAN and the Python Package Repository.  Aggregated data and related materials required to replicate results of published articles will be available thru ICPSR or GitHub.<br/><br/>This project will develop a Bayesian framework that parsimoniously represent the sub-structures of very large graphs with a novel approach to sparse coding.  The project also will provide an intuitive set of methods that are designed to enable social scientists to better understand the latent structure in new forms of massive social network data.  Despite the promise of unsolicited data sources, the size and granularity of the data present substantial challenges.  From a statistical perspective, the massive size and heterogeneity of the data confound existing computational tools.  From a social science perspective, the data represent the manifestations of deeper social relationships.  This project bridges the gap between the mathematical/statistical descriptions of these large social network graphs and the underlying social structure.  The Bayesian representation of local network structure will build upon related research on network motifs and random graph models, enabling meaningful inference about real-world network processes.  The sparse coding approach will allow for the compact and scalable representation of extremely large groups.  The project will contribute to related statistical literatures in Bayesian models for social networks, Bayesian model uncertainty, and network inference."

The research in this program involves mental health, from a social/behavioral science perspective. Long-term effects of deep-rooted tensions in any country and within any population can include political upheaval, socio-economic disadvantages, ethnic discord and rapid change from one economic system to another; all these factors can have an effect on the rates of mental illness in that population. This REU Site's research program directly impacts a group of 27 undergraduate students over a three year period by broadening students' global awareness and cross-cultural competence through a meaningful, interdisciplinary research experience focusing on a case study for elevated levels of mental illness in a country that has been going through multiple transitions. The case study is Ukraine in post-Soviet era. As part of this REU site, a diverse group of undergraduate students are involved in an ongoing research project exploring the mental health of Ukrainian citizens. In this REU site the PI-team recruits students with an emphasis on the participation of students participants from under-represented groups and institutions where research opportunities are limited. These students will further broaden the impact of their research experience by presenting to high school students and students at their home institutions. <br/><br/>This REU site is focused on a topic of research that is of great interest in the fields of sociology and social psychology. The program incorporates an on-site collaborative research and cultural immersion experience for students in Ukraine, working directly with collaborators at the Kiev International Institute of Sociology (a national research firm in Ukraine). The project provides strong mentorship and development of undergraduate student researchers by an interdisciplinary team of four experienced faculty members, in conjunction with a team of worldwide experts on Ukraine mental health and, and it provides some of the only nationally representative information on mental health risk factors and impacts in Ukraine. The dataset students will be able to use in this project is innovative and unique in the fields of psychology and global health studies. Analyzing these types of global data as a means of training students for future work in psychology and/or health studies means that the work itself has intellectual merit, but that inasmuch as this affects future generations of scholars, it also has long-term impact on the fields.

PLM, GLM and GLMA along with sleep position will be used to develop metrics for PLM/hr,  sleep time, wake during sleep and  quiet vs. restless (fragmented) sleep to support evaluations and treatments.  To address this technology gap, this project is developing and commercializing a novel system, RestEaZe that identifies GLM (leg movements), PLMS (foot flexions), and leg position using a single point measurement system in a home setting.

At that same time, global sea level was elevated by ~6-9 m, relative to present, according to studies of exposed corals in Australia, the Seychelles, and the Caribbean.   Such high sea level today would displace up to 20% of the US population. It is estimated that Greenland glacial melting could have accounted for ~2 m of sea-level rise, thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of mountain glaciers could account for ~0.5 m each, but Antarctica must account for the bulk of it. Where did the melting occur?  It has been speculated that the one particular part of Antarctica (the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, WAIS) was the site of the inferred melting. The marine sediments that have accumulated off-shore West Antarctica should provide evidence of this melting, but the lack of robust age control in Antarctic marine sediments has stymied their interpretation in terms of past instability of WAIS. This proposal tests a relatively new method, involving the recording of the past geomagnetic field by the sediments themselves, that can provide age models for the Antarctic marine sediments, contribute their interpretation in terms of instability of WAIS over the last few climate cycles, and hence contribute to our current climate/sea level dilemma.  <br/><br/>Over the last 20 years, relative (geomagnetic) paleointensity (RPI) proxies have been combined with oxygen isotope data in Quaternary sediments in the North Atlantic with the objective of implementing RPI as a high-resolution stratigraphic correlation tool.  The relatively rapid rate of change of geomagnetic field intensity (currently about 5% per century), and the fact that sediments with sedimentation rates <~50 cm/kyr are likely to record only the main axial dipole component of the field, means that RPI can be expected to provide a high-resolution global correlation tool. There are now several examples of tandem correlations involving RPI and oxygen isotope data over the last few Myrs, implemented through automated matching protocols such as 'Match'. The results have led to the generation of temporally calibrated reference stacks for RPI (such as PISO) that can be used, in conjunction with oxygen isotope data, to provide improvements in the resolution of Quaternary stratigraphies. This proposal is to test the use of RPI as a stratigraphic tool in marine sediment drifts off the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Bellingshausen Sea, using seven piston cores recovered in early 2015 during cruise JR298 of the RRS James Clark Ross.  The west Antarctic region provides an important test of the stratigraphic role of relative paleointensity (RPI) proxies because the sedimentation history of Antarctic sediment drifts is a key to interpreting their sedimentation history in terms of instability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS). The paucity of foraminiferal carbonate at high southerly latitudes means that age models in sediments from the region cannot rely on oxygen isotope data. Age models in these Antarctic drifts have relied on the association of high biogenic siliceous/carbonate percentage (as well as proxies for high biogenic content from magnetic susceptibility, wet bulk density and biogenic Ba content) with interglacial marine isotopic stages.  These methodologies are not ideal because they have low resolution and impose interpretations on the sediment record. For these reasons, we seek new methods for determining age in these drift sediment using RPI to interpret sedimentation rates, XRF core scanning data, and ice-rafting debris (IRD) proxies, in terms of instability of WAIS and APIS.  This project will be assisted by an undergraduate researcher."

As observers on the outer skin of the Earth, even after four and a half billion years, we see constant reminders of this evolution in the form of earthquakes and volcanoes. Even the distinction between ocean and continent owes its origin to this dynamic process. This study is focused on the enabler of this process - the plastic nature of what we consider hard rocks. Over long times at elevated pressure and temperature, rocks behave as liquids. In recent years, tools have evolved that allow us to measure the viscous character of these hard objects at pressures and temperatures that one finds deep in the Earth. These experiments are built around a synchrotron facility that has been built at a national lab. The investigators will use both the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. This study will help our understanding of this dynamic evolution of the Earth.  A graduate student will be supported and will participate in this research.<br/><br/>MgSiO3 in the perovskite crystal structure (bridgmanite) is the most abundant mineral in the Earth and it's calcium counterpart (CaSiO3) is among the five most abundant minerals. The plastic nature of these minerals defines the fluid character of the deep Earth. These properties are both pressure and temperature dependent, and as of yet, unknown. Knowledge of these properties along with proposed temperature models can help constrain dynamics of the Earth evolution and current state. The plastic properties of these minerals is particularly interesting because these minerals are composed of silicon in six coordination with oxygen, while the bulk of materials studied to date have silicon in four coordination with oxygen. The investigating team proposes to study the mechanical properties of these minerals at conditions of pressure and temperature appropriate to the deep Earth. They will focus on defining a quantitative flow law that expresses the plastic properties of these materials. The plasticity of lower mantle minerals at lower mantle conditions of pressure and temperature has been beyond the experimental reach. This has left us with little mineral-based knowledge of the effective viscosity of the lower mantle at the conditions of the anticipated geotherm. Development of new deformation equipment enables a new effort to characterize the quantitative flow law of the high pressure phases at the extremes of pressure and temperature of the top of the lower mantle. This proposal is to study both the Mg and the Ca end-member silicate perovskite at these conditions. This is made possible by a new facility being installed at the new synchrotron, NSLS II, at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. The new facility will provide world class synchrotron X-ray light for these experiments with a new DT25 guideblock in a 1000 ton hydraulic press with deformation capabilities. Using standard X-ray diffraction and imaging tools, the team will be able to define stress and strain rate in the sample at the extreme conditions."

The wave glider has been adequately demonstrated as a robust high-endurance platform for open-ocean work and has begun to demonstrate its capability for research-quality measurements. This project will advance that capability by increasing our understanding of vehicle and sensor performance and suitability for measuring air?sea fluxes of momentum, moisture, and heat.

The project will include graduate and undergraduate student training and outreach activities through local schools, the Seattle Aquarium, and the Pacific Science Center.<br/><br/>The main research topics addressed in this project are the spatial structure of winds and surface properties in the Southern Ocean, the influence of surface wave Stokes drift on Ekman transport in the upper ocean, wave modulation of wind stress, near-inertial wind energy input into the ocean, and the coupling between winds and sea surface temperature. The observations will be taken by a Liquid Robotics Wave Glider SV3 autonomous surface vehicle instrumented for measurements of surface waves, temperature and salinity, upper-ocean currents, barometric pressure, and winds. Deployment and recovery will exploit planned cruises maintaining the Ocean Observatories Initiative Southern Ocean array and re-supplying the US Antarctic Program's Palmer Station. The sampling plan consists of (1) three months near the Ocean Observatories Initiative air-sea interactions buoy to study spatial structure and allow cross-calibration of the various sensors and their responses to vehicle heading and wind and wave conditions; (2) two months conducting a downstream grid survey across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current towards Drake Passage; and (3) a month-long timeseries in southern Drake Passage in the weak-current region between the Polar Front and the Southern ACC Front before recovery from the R/V Laurence M.

This mechanosensing ability is essential for many phenomena ranging from the movement of individual cells, cell differentiation and fate choice as well as large-scale tissue rearrangement during development. Recent work has shown that immune cells are responsive to their mechanical environment and this mechanosensitivity tunes their ability to respond to infectious agents. This project aims to understand how internal forces generated by the biopolymer networks of actin filaments and the motor protein, myosin, enable the T lymphocyte to modulate biochemical signaling, enhancing our understanding of how mechanical stimuli and biochemical signaling are coupled during the immune response using concepts and tools from physics and engineering. This work has potential implications for improving the design of artificial antigen-presenting devices that can enhance the efficiency of immunotherapies against pathogens and tumors. The PI will develop a lecture and laboratory course in cell mechanics, in which concepts from topics such as statistical and continuum mechanics will be used to explain biological processes. The PI will encourage minority and high school students from the area to participate in research. The PI will organize biophysics laboratory demonstrations as part of the Summer Girls Program at the University of Maryland to encourage participation of female students in science and technology fields. <br/><br/>The binding of T cell receptors (TCRs) to antigen-derived peptides results in the formation of dynamic protein assemblies, called signaling microclusters, that serve as the initiating points for T cell activation and the first step of the adaptive immune response. Recent work has revealed that T cells are responsive to the mechanical environment on which antigens are presented and that physical forces can trigger T cell activation. However, the mechanisms by which T cells combine mechanical and biochemical signals to carry out specific functions is not well understood. This project will test the hypothesis that signaling microclusters are responsive to forces, acting as dynamic mechanosensors, thereby allowing the cell to respond and sense the physical properties of the antigen-bearing surface. The PI aims to elucidate how cellular forces regulate the assembly of signaling assemblies at activated T cell receptors (Aim 1), to determine the molecular linkages between cytoskeletal forces and T cell signaling activation (Aim 2) and how these forces more globally lead to activation at the level of the whole cell (Aim 3). This study will reveal common principles in the mechanisms of receptor-mediated sensing of the mechanical environment and the more commonly studied integrin-mediated mechanosensing."

Net-shaping, a process that shapes a material in one processing step into its final shape, is well established for thermoplastics, but thermoplastics are too weak for most structural applications. In structural applications that are critical, such as aerospace, automotive, and hard-tissue replacements, metals are typically used. Forming of metals, however, has been limited. This project will combine metal-like properties and plastic-like processing. Particularly, thermoplastic based blow-molding and stretch blow-molding, will be translated during this project from a scientific discovery into a technological process, which can meet the need for a metal net-shape process.  These blow-molding processes have potentially vast commercial ramification as they could replace many of the currently used metal processing methods, and hence replace many of the applications currently occupied by metals and plastics. In order to reach such a translation, this project will determine processing parameters that are required for a commercial fabrication process. In addition, a commercial viability study will be carried out considering capital investment, processing time, and materials costs. As a product, a commercial apparatus and processing procedure will be determined in consultation with equipment manufacturers. Specifically, cycle time will be minimized, and processing conditions optimized for speed, energy efficiency, and robustness. Considering the redundancy of machining, joining, and other finishing procedures, and taking into account the processing speed and accuracy, blow-molding of metallic glasses is envisioned to replace currently used materials and processes used for electronic casings.<br/> <br/>This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The effect of high strain rate on the deformation behavior is not well understood. Particularly, if the metallic glass forming liquid remains to behave like a Newtonian liquid as strain rates exceeding 0.1/sec. Accurate understanding of the deformation behavior, the metallic glasses' response to temperature and pressure is crucial for future modeling of mold filling during blow-molding and stretch blow-molding.  How the high strain rates effects the mechanical properties of the metallic glass also will be investigated. Bending experiments will be conducted and the strain to failure will be used as a quantitative measure for bending ductility. <br/><br/>Involved personnel include graduate students, post-docs, undergraduate students, and visiting undergraduate students. They will be exposed to the whole range of technological development; from fundamental science of determining the deformation behavior, to engineering aspects of developing appropriate processes and machinery, to commercial and business aspects of viability and comparison studies. Students will be exposed to the state of the art metallurgy processes and characterization methods and will also develop a deeper understanding of the connection between science, innovation, and entrepreneurial skills."

This award is cofunded by the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering program in the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.  Krylov and her research group are interested in properties known as non-linear optical (NLO) properties.  NLO properties are exploited in novel technologies such as microfabrication, 3D optical data storage and nanolithography, ultra-fast electro-optic modulation and switching, bioimaging, photodynamic therapies, and a variety of other nano-bio-photonics applications. The new tools for interpretation of experimental spectra and for the in silico design of new materials with properties matching particular application are expected to impact both fundamental and applied research (such as bioimaging and molecular electronics) on NLO properties.  Computer software generated from this research are made available to the broader research community through the widely-used Q-Chem and Spartan package.  Once mature, the software is distributed as open-source code. <br/><br/>The emphasis of this research is on open-shell species and molecules in complex environments. The proposed developments capitalize on the work conducted in the previous funding period, which included developing formalisms and implementing calculations of electronic factors for two-photon absorption (2PA) and static and dynamic polarizabilities within the coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) family of methods.  The main thrust the current work is to develop the formalisms and codes: (i) to include the effect of the environment (solvent, molecular solids, proteins) via the Effective Fragment Potential method; and (ii) for higher-order NLO properties within the EOM-CC framework, such as three-photon absorption moments and hyperpolarizabilities. The planned applications of the new methods include investigations of fundamental aspects of non-linear spectroscopy, such as: (i) the extent of (non)-locality of NLO properties and the convergence of these properties computed within polarizable embedding schemes with respect to the size of the QM region; (ii) the relative importance of the electrostatic perturbation and polarization response of the solvent versus the contribution from delocalized excited states (such as charge transfer to solvent states); and (iii) the effect of electron correlation on NLO properties, with an emphasis on open-shell systems.will be distributed as open source, similarly to our tensor library and other Q-CHEM modules.

If emotions are intensely experienced it may be easy to tell, but some people are good at hiding their emotions, or they may be unaware of or unable to report what they are feeling. Fortunately, technological advances in measuring brain activity and emotion theory can help us to have a more objective understanding of people's emotional states. Some theories of emotion suggest that different emotional states, such as fear, anger, or happiness, arise because of specific, dedicated neural circuitry that responds in the same way any time that emotion is experienced. For example, the circuitry for happiness is the same whether it arises because you get a compliment or you learned of a promotion. In contrast, the proposed research is built on an innovative 'situated neuroscience' model of emotions. This model hypothesizes that emotions correspond to variable neural patterns. These variable patterns are hypothesized to be determined by the emotion category experienced, such as fear, and partly by the context in which the emotion is experienced. The context includes components from culture and the situation itself. Dr. Kristen Lindquist, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and colleagues proposed three experiments to examine this model. Her research will use measures of the location of brain events (functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) and the timing of brain events (electroencephalography; EEG). The integration of emotion theory and technology in this way could help to improve communication about and understanding of emotions, help us to predict when emotions influence our decisions and performance, and may have benefits for the way we interact with others.<br/> <br/>The proposed research integrates emotion theory with technological advances in measuring brain activity to ""read"" emotional feelings from brain states. The aim is to develop a situated neuroscience of emotion that will inform our understanding of the basis of emotions and their conscious experience. Three experiments are proposed that examine the role of situational and cultural contexts in emotion and brain activity. The first experiment examines fear and anger and their interaction with situational and cultural contexts on brain activity, using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). The situation is manipulated to be either social or non-social, and culture stems from enrolling natives of the US and China who know the emotion-based norms and values of their respective culture.  The second experiment extends this investigation to the temporal dynamics of emotional brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). The third study uses machine learning on data obtained from the prior experiments to determine which variables best predict brain activity during emotion, in the different contexts. Understanding the situated nature of emotion is crucial to an understanding of how neural circuits map on to subjective mental states. These findings may improve our understanding of emotional experience in ourselves and others, and enhance our communication, well-being, and diplomatic relations. It may also inform applied advancements in the areas of mood-related illnesses and brain-computer interface."

Atoms will be cooled to extremely low temperatures and put into high energy states called Rydberg states.  In Rydberg states the outermost electron (or the negatively charged component of an atom) travels in extremely large orbits around the nucleus (or the core of an atom).  Because of these large orbits, atoms in Rydberg states have properties which are exaggerated relative to the properties of atoms in their natural, or ground state.  One such property is that Rydberg atoms interact strongly with each other when separated by large distances, even though they have no net charge.  Normally, when a laser is shined on a group of atoms, the outermost electron in each atom is readily promoted to Rydberg states.  However, the interactions among multiple Rydberg atoms causes this excitation to be suppressed, or ""blocked,"" and leads to the creation of fewer Rydberg atoms than would otherwise be created.  This suppression of excitation may help enable the use of single atoms as the ""bits"" in computer (""neutral atom quantum computing"").  Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize data security and encryption.  The present project will focus on processes which make the Rydberg excitation blockade function less effectively (state-mixing interactions).  Essentially, if one tries to put atoms into a given Rydberg state using a laser, the atoms will mix into other states.  This mixing ""breaks the blockade"" and leads to an undesirably large number of Rydberg atoms.  The goals of the present research are to quantify the extent to which state mixing interactions reduce the blockade efficiency, to understand the physical mechanism which gives rise to the mixing, and to study the experimental parameters which lead to the best excitation blockade.  Understanding these issues will allow other researchers to use the blockade in a way that minimizes unwanted effects when developing a quantum computer.  The project also involves a significant educational component.  The PI will develop educational modules for a diverse group, ranging from general education students to advanced physics students.   The PI will also study the impact of metacognitive exercises on problem solving performance in the introductory physics classroom.  All work will be done at a primarily undergraduate university with a significant fraction of first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The Rydberg excitation blockade, a process whereby strong interactions among highly-excited atoms suppress laser excitation, has been at the heart of an array of recent experimental achievements.  It has been suggested that state-mixing interactions, which result from couplings among multi-particle Rydberg states near a Frster resonance, may compromise the effectiveness of the excitation suppression under otherwise favorable conditions.  Experimentally, however, the extent to which the blockade is compromised has been unknown, as large amounts of state mixing have always accompanied an improved blockade near resonance.  In this project, the extent to which state-mixing reduces the blockade efficiency will be quantified using state-selective field ionization spectroscopy of rubidium Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap.  This work will lead to a better understanding of the physical mechanism responsible for enhanced state-mixing.  Additionally, the project will include a systematic study of the experimental conditions for the best blockade near a Frster resonance. The PI will design an eduational module on laser cooling and trapping for a general education course as well as an advanced laboratory experiment on characterizing an ultracold atom cloud in a magneto optical trap."

This market economy demands flexible workers and creates work that is uncertain and unpredictable. These changes, characterized by the relationship between employer and employee transitioning from relational to transactional, is generating an unprecedented form of precarious work in the professional middle class. This project analyzes how professionals negotiate contradictions between cultural narratives about lovable work, success, and agency, and unprecedented levels of precarious work. <br/><br/>The research conceptualizes two broad experiences of professional work, one in the market economy and one in the organizations economy. Work within the market economy is characterized by instability, risk, flexibility, and precariousness, while work within the organizations economy is characterized by stability, low risk, rigidity, and security. This project compares professionals who experience work as precarious to those who do not, holding occupation constant by analyzing three occupations that have positions in both the market and the organizations economy? engineers, designers, and nurses. In total, the investigators will interview 72 professionals. These data are needed in order to understand the new problems professional workers face, and to develop cultural and institutional solutions.  This research will contribute insights that will help to build a new social contract that grants employers the flexibility that the market demands and employees the securities and cultural coherence that they need to thrive in a market economy."

The research will focus on how teachers incorporate comparison, explanation and discussion into their teaching, how this impacts students' algebra knowledge, and how effective the approach is relative to business-as-usual instruction. The results of the research will inform teaching and learning for a central course in the mathematics curriculum since it is foundational to students' later mathematics learning. The approach also examines the entire classroom system including both students' knowledge and learning and teachers' development and implementation. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The research will first refine the CEMS Algebra materials and then document the feasibility of their implementation and the effects on student learning. The project takes a holistic approach by incorporating materials for teaching, professional development, and the study of teaching practice. The work will expand theories of algebra learning to include both conceptual and procedural learning. It will include detailed analysis about fidelity of implementation to understand how instructional differences influence students' knowledge. The first phase of the study (refining the materials) includes implementation in classrooms, teacher professional development, collection of lesson videos, and the development of student assessments for each unit. The second phase of the study compares the effects of the treatment to the business-as-usual with one district. The teachers from year 1 will serve as the treatment group in year 2 and a comparison group of teachers will be selected. Data collection and analysis will focus on fidelity of implementation and assessments of students' learning. Year 3 will be similar to year 2 but expand to a second school district and include more teachers."

However, migration and genetic admixture are also drivers of biological change and adaptation. Consequently, characterizing how ancient migrations shape genetic diversity is vital to inform understanding of biological ancestry, cultural evolution, and health outcomes in admixed human populations. But, because modern populations do not retain all the genomic diversity of ancient groups, genetic research with contemporary individuals provides limited resolution for reconstructing ancient demographic events. This limitation can be addressed by combining archaeological questions with ancient DNA. This investigation characterizes the genetic diversity of ancient human groups and test hypotheses about their relationships to other ancient and modern populations. Specifically, ancient DNA obtained from human skeletal remains in three archaeological sites (Tibes, Punta Candelero and Paso del Indio) will be analyzed to investigate the role of migration and genetic admixture in the history of pre-Columbian populations from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. The project incorporates training of undergraduate students in laboratory and analytical methods and contributes to the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences through training of a female, Puerto Rican doctoral student. The researchers will engage the public by disseminating project findings through Ask-A Biologist, an online resource for students, teachers and the public, and by collaborating with archaeologists and the Ceremonial Center of Tibes site museum to integrate findings in public site tours. A significant aspect of this research is the optimization of protocols for DNA recovery from degraded skeletal remains. This methodological development improves ancient DNA recovery from remains in tropical environments, and can be extended to forensic applications where DNA may be damaged due to corpse deposition in adverse preservation contexts. <br/><br/>Debate remains about how many migrants settled the island of Puerto Rico in antiquity, where they came from, and how these processes influenced social interaction networks across the ancient Caribbean basin. This investigation compares ancient mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from skeletal remains dated A.D. 500-1300, with data from other modern and ancient indigenous populations of the Americas to determine: (1) How were ancient populations in Puerto Rico related to continental Native American groups, and what may this indicate about their origins? (2) What was the extent of gene flow in the pre-contact Caribbean, and what may this indicate about local social interaction? Project findings reassess existing models for the peopling of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and explore how migration and admixture shaped the biocultural diversity of ancient Caribbean populations. By also examining the extent of inter-island migration and genetic exchange, this investigation elucidates the role of kinship, residence patterns and mobility in the maintenance of interaction networks across the pre-Columbian Caribbean. Lastly, this study also sheds light on the genetic relationships between pre-Columbian populations and modern Puerto Ricans, the second largest Hispanic group in the USA. Given the growing role that Native American ethnicity plays in contemporary Puerto Rican culture, project results have implications for the construction and experience of modern Puerto Rican identity."

This manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation. In contrast to the complex mixture of fatty acids currently produced in the oleochemical industry, the technology developed in this project will deliver a product stream containing simpler mixtures of monounsaturated fatty acids, which will eliminate the costly separation cost and be directly used to synthesize cost-efficient high-performance lubricants. Due to the improved lubrication performance of these molecules, this technology will potentially increase the energy efficiency of industrial and transportation machinery. By utilizing biological carbon feedstocks and producing bio-degradable products, this technology has the potential to reduce the environment footprint of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as surfactants and polymers. A large commercial potential of this technology has been identified in the lubricant market, currently valued at $123B per annum, and predicted to grow to $178B per annum in the next 5-years. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop technology that will deliver novel bio-based monounsaturated fatty acids that provide new chemical structures allowing innovations in lubricants not possible from petroleum-based raw materials. Based on successful development of bacterial strains capable of producing enriched monounsaturated fatty acids in the Phase I project, the Phase II project will further de-risk the technology and scale up the capability to produce sufficient quantities of monounsaturated fatty acids to be evaluated by potential customers.  By optimizing and scaling up the fermentation process and developing the product extraction procedure, large quantity of the first generation product (55% enriched monounsaturated fatty acids) will be produced. It will be used to chemically synthesize high-performance lubricants (i.e., polyol esters), whose physical-chemical and tribological properties will be evaluated and provided to potential customers. In this project, metabolic engineering, system biology, and evolutionary strategies will be applied to further improve the strains for producing second generation products that are more enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (70-80%) and achieve commercial viable technology metrics. The monounsaturated fatty acids are envisioned as platform chemicals for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous specialty chemicals that have applications in additional markets, such as surfactants and polymers."

Professor Waterman is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Vermont. The objective of this proposal is to discover and understand catalytic reactions that form phosphorus-carbon and silicon-carbon bonds. Central to meeting that objective is utilizing abundant metals as catalysts to afford divergent chemical reactivity of phosphorus-hydrogen and silicon-hydrogen bonds with a variety of reagents. Two specific reactions will be explored: alpha elimination and hydrophosphination. Alpha elimination is a rare and relatively new reaction with the potential to facilitate the synthesis of complex molecular structures. These structures have applications in materials science, catalysis, and biomedicine. Hydrophosphination is a well-established transformation, but questions and limitations remain. Overcoming these challenges makes this reaction available for broader use in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, for example. Improved understanding in both reactions would advance the multi-billion dollar field of catalysis. Professor Waterman has been able to successfully recruit students underrepresented in the sciences, provide research experiences for high school students, and engage in educational outreach with K-12 students, practices to be continued in this project.   <br/><br/>The proposal explores two unique kinds of catalysis to understand and improve the catalytic preparation of E- carbon (C) (E = phosphorus or silicon) bonds, recognizing that abundant and inexpensive metals can be enlisted to produce divergent reactivity upon E-hydrogen (H) bond activation in the presence of unsaturated substrates. Through a series of testable hypotheses, a validated set of design features for alpha elimination catalysis is sought. This reaction may result in the efficient synthesis of phosphorus- and silicon-containing molecules via catalytic E-C bond formation is a key driver. Prior discoveries in this group demonstrate that such new reactivity is possible, and efforts in this area seek to improve understanding of M-E bonding and reaction chemistry. Efforts to discover new and highly efficient syntheses of chiral-at-phosphorus ligands though hydrophosphination provide a platform to address those fundamental issues and broaden the understanding and utility of this key P-C bond forming reaction. Beyond the benefit of these reactions to fields such as materials science, energy, and biomedicine, the outreach program includes direct research experiences for high school students in support of project goals."

This project marks the first time social scientists will observe the processes of the IPCC in real time, from the inside. The researchers will have a sustained opportunity to observe, analyze, and communicate how expert assessors shape climate assessments during the writing process. In turn, this research will be distributed among researchers as well as climate policy practitioners to help improve the application of climate science to policy, including the inclusion of diverse representation in the assessment process as well as the portrayal and communication of consensus, conflict, bias, error, risk, and uncertainty. This project will inform curricular development of a program in Climate Studies for undergraduate students, improve representation and capacity building among diverse climate scholars including undergraduate students and social science researchers in developing countries, communicate research findings to the public, and feed research findings back to the assessor community. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The primary purpose of this project is to contribute to ongoing scholarly attempts to understanding scientific knowledge production. The field of science studies has provided ample evidence of the empirical inadequacy of algorithmic models of scientific knowledge production, and has of late come to stress the importance of expert judgment within diverse communities. This project explicitly addresses the practice of expert judgment in a major domain of contemporary scientific activity. It will also provide suggestions to improve the assessment and decision process. Assessments are expensive in terms of time, money, and scientific human capital, and it important for the scientific community re-assess the commitment that has been made to them. The researchers will produce policy-relevant and scientist-relevant papers to convey project findings to the IPCC and involved scientist assessors. They will also present to user communities, such as at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meetings."

Examples include the persistent northerly and southerly flows on opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains in North America and the Andes Mountains in South America, and the easterly flow that surrounds Antarctica. The goal of this project is to understand what causes these jets and to study their impacts on climate.  Previous work developed a two-dimensional theory which explains such jets as a balanced dynamical response of the atmosphere in response to forcing by solar heating and infrared radiative cooling of the elevated terrain.  Computed results using simplified terrain profiles showed qualitative agreement with observed winds in two-dimensional cross sections through the Andes and Antarctica.  <br/><br/>This project will extend the theory to three dimensions, taking into account the effects of the earth's spherical shape and the full shape of the elevated terrain.  Solutions of the resulting equations will be computed using a novel numerical method which refines the grid where needed to obtain accurate solutions with minimal computational work.  Solutions will be computed for jets associated with several regions of complex terrain around the globe, such as Antarctica, the Tibetan Plateau, Greenland, and the Rockies and Andes, and validated by comparison with observational data.<br/><br/>Beyond developing our fundamental understanding of atmospheric dynamics, this work has societal relevance due to the importance of low-level jets for regional climate. For example, the Great Plains low-level jet is responsible for a substantial portion of the moisture transport into the eastern half United States which sustains agriculture, and the low-level jet off the eastern coast of Africa is a major component of the Indian monsoon which greatly affects many aspects of life in the Indian subcontinent.  This project will also contribute to developing the future scientific workforce by supporting and training two graduate students in research, and training one undergraduate student in computational mathematics and modern scientific programming.  Finally, the methods developed in this project will be made available to researchers in atmospheric dynamics through software codes, so that they can be applied to a wide array of scientific problems."

An isotope of the element beryllium, 10Be, is produced in the atmosphere by high-energy protons (cosmic rays) that enter Earth's atmosphere from space.  It is removed from the atmosphere by settling or by scavenging by rain or snowfall.  Hence, concentrations of 10Be in snow at the South Pole reflect the production rate of 10Be in the atmosphere.  Because the rate of production of 10Be over Antarctica depends primarily on the strength of the Sun's magnetic field, measurements of 10Be in the South Pole ice core will provide a record of changes in solar activity.  The South Pole ice core will reach an age of 40,000 years at the bottom.  The project will result in measurements of 10Be at annual resolution for the last 100 years and selected periods in the more distant past, such as the Maunder Minimum, a period during the late 17th century during which no sunspots were observed, or the last glacial cold period, about 20,000 years ago.  A climate model that can simulate the production of 10Be in the atmosphere, it's transport through the atmosphere, and its deposition at the snow surface in Antarctica will be used to aid in using the 10Be data to determine past changes in solar activity from decadal to millennial scale, and in turn to evaluate the role of the Sun in Earth?s climate from a new perspective.<br/><br/>The production of 10Be in Earth's atmosphere results from the spallation of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere by cosmic rays.  Cosmic ray variations in the high latitudes are primarily modulated by solar variability. Time-series records of 10Be from ice cores are therefore important for deriving variations in solar activity through time, which is fundamental to understanding climate variability. Deposition of 10Be to the ice surface is also influenced by variability in atmospheric circulation and deposition processes, and South Pole is the best available location for minimizing the influence of variable atmospheric circulation on 10Be deposition. To date, only one record of 10Be exists from South Pole; that record is widely used in solar forcing estimates used in climate models, but covers only the last millennium and ends in CE 1982.  We will obtain 10Be concentration measurements in a 1500-m, 40000-year long ice core from the South Pole.  This will extend the existing record both further back in time and forward to the present, providing overlap with the modern instrumental record of solar and climate variability. High resolution (annual to biannual) measurements will be made in targeted areas of interest, including the last 100 years, the Maunder Minimum (CE 1650-1715), and the last glacial maximum. The novel data will be used in conjunction with climate model experiments that incorporate 10Be production, transport, and deposition physics. Together, data and modeling will create an updated record of atmospheric 10Be production and hence of solar activity."

This project designs novel architectures and algorithms for deep learning, and applies them to spectroscopic domains, such as LIBS and hyperspectral imaging. Three challenges from spectroscopic domains guide the research. First, in many applications such as the Curiosity rover on Mars, the number of available LIBS spectra are limited as it requires an active sensing operation followed by transmission of data by a robot situated millions of miles from Earth. A further challenge is that data from Mars is inherently unlabeled, and instrumental variations and terrain variations between Earth and Mars require solving a key transfer learning problem. For hyperspectral imaging, the project is extending work on deep learning applied to two-dimensional images to data that involves two spatial dimensions as well as the third spectral dimension, where images are recorded at multiple wavelengths. This project explores a variety of ways of designing new convolutional neural networks and other approaches that can effectively exploit the third spectral dimension."

The initial invasion of a novel pathogen into a susceptible host population can cause a disease outbreak resulting in high levels of mortality and declines in population size. When this happens, natural selection can occur on both the host and pathogen populations during the disease outbreak. This can result in evolutionary changes in the host's susceptibility and tolerance to infection by the pathogen. It can also change the pathogen's ability to damage the host (virulence). These changes can in turn determine whether the host population can persist and recover from the disease.  Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial in development of conservation strategies for threatened species. This project will examine these processes for the case of a fungal pathogen that causes the disease Chytridiomycosis in frogs and salamanders. This disease has had catastrophic effects on amphibians worldwide, with numerous species extinctions documented in recent decades and many more species at risk. The researchers will investigate the patterns of evolutionary change in both the pathogen and the host (mountain yellow-legged frogs), following the invasion of the disease into hundreds of high elevation lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. This project will contribute to the understanding of the role of infectious diseases, such as Chytridiomycosis, as agents of evolutionary change in natural populations. It will provide critical information to state and federal agencies. It will also train and educate numerous, undergraduates and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/>This research builds on data from a long-term study of the population dynamics of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana sierrae and Rana muscosa) in the complex landscape of the California Sierra Nevada, and the impacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), as it has invaded and spread through hundreds of frog populations. In most cases, invasion of Bd results in outbreaks of the disease Chytridiomycosis, rapid frog population declines, and local extinctions. In some cases however long-term persistence of frog populations occurs with Bd in an enzootic state in which the impact of the pathogen is greatly reduced. The research will make use of recent advances in molecular approaches, and the extensive dataset and archive of samples from the R. sierrae/R. muscosa - Bd system, to investigate how populations of both host and pathogen change during the transition from pre-pathogen arrival, to disease outbreak, to enzootic disease, to potential recovery of the pre-disease host population abundances. This dataset will be used to investigate the genetic basis for differences in host resistance/tolerance and pathogen virulence. Cutting-edge genomic analysis of existing swab samples will be combined with continued surveys of field populations to identify new disease outbreaks and describe the transition from outbreak to enzootic state, collection of Bd cultures and frog mucosal samples from field populations, and laboratory experiments on Bd virulence and frog"

During courtship, the unusually colorful male Habronattus jumping spiders engage in elaborate dances that showcase movements, colors, and patterns to prospective mates. Although females react to these displays by changing where they face, we know almost nothing about where females look during courtship, or how male displays function to manipulate female gaze. To understand how these displays have evolved to capture and retain female visual attention, this research program will use newly available eye tracking technology and digital tools to examine interactions between male displays and female gaze in the Fiery Haired Jumping Spider, Habronattus pyrrithrix. The research team will then expand their work to 20 additional Habronattus species to understand broader patterns of display evolution. This research program will allow us to better understand how animals communicate through complex visual displays and how evolution shapes complex signals. In addition, the scientific team will use insights from their research to enrich educational collaborations with community partners. These partnerships include the development and implementation of curricula for regional public schools, as well as biomimicry-themed ""superhero summer camps"" and afterschool programming in collaboration with Assemble, a Pittsburgh-based non-profit organization which focuses on teaching inner-city youth about science by integrating art into science education.<br/><br/>One widespread feature of visual systems is distinct regionalization of visual competency across the visual field, including regions of heightened motion sensitivity, spatial acuity and/or color vision. Animals compensate for this regionalization with movements of the head or eyes that aim specialized retinal regions at areas of interest within the visual scene. These gaze movements determine what animals see when they interact with visual stimuli. However, despite the fundamental importance of gaze to animal vision, we know almost nothing about how animals use their gaze to evaluate communicatory displays. We know even less about how visual displays have evolved to effectively capture, retain or manipulate the gaze of signal receivers. This research will build upon current understandings of the coevolution of visual signals and visual systems by evaluating the evolutionary relevance of gaze-display dynamics for diversification of male courtship displays in Habronattus spiders. The research will employ gaze-tracking, video playbacks, and digital and physical manipulations of male displays to reveal basic properties of gaze-display interactions in the species Habronattus pyrrithrix. Leveraging insights derived from these in-depth studies, the research will use comparative approaches to test broader hypotheses regarding the evolution of gaze-display interactions across the genus Habronattus."

Computational algorithms, including machine learning and signal processing techniques, are often used to extract valuable information from wearable sensor data continuously and in real-time. These algorithms, however, need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as addition/removal of a sensor to/from the network, sensor displacement/misplacement, sensor upgrade, adoption of the system by new users, and changes in physical and behavioral status of the user. Retraining of the computational algorithms requires collecting sufficient amount of labeled training data, a time consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive process that limits scalability and sustainability of wearable technologies. The goal of this research is to enable automatic reconfiguration of the computational algorithms without need for collecting new labeled data. <br/><br/>This proposed research aims to design, develop and validate algorithms and tools for self-configuration of wearables through two overarching research trusts. First, this project investigates synchronous multi-view learning solutions for scenarios where source and target views observe the phenomena of interest simultaneously. In the synchronous learning, direct associations between observations made by the source view and those of the target view are established through context-sensitive learning processes that take the properties of physiological monitoring and human body into account for transfer learning purposes. Second, this research develops asynchronous multi-view learning algorithms to allow for automatic knowledge transfer even in absence of synchronous measurements in the source and target views. The asynchronous learning research devises feature mapping, instance transformation, and data labeling techniques to determine how data instances of the target view are associated with those of the source view while taking into consideration physical and contextual attributes of the user.<br/><br/>This project will potentially result in highly sustainable and scalable wearables capable to self-monitor and self-configure in highly dynamic and uncontrolled environments. The true realization of computationally autonomous wearables will allow for conducting high-precision chronic disease management and contribute to availability of new wearable-based consumer applications. This can lead to the development of products and business around the concept of human-centered IoT and their use in automation of health management and many applications that are currently infeasible."

If successful, this will significantly advance our understanding in all these key areas, produce new practical algorithmic methodologies, as well as build new connections with other fields, including quantum information theory, statistical physics, extremal graph theory and more.<br/><br/>This collaborative grant will foster new interactions between intellectual communities that have had relatively little interaction so far, and the PIs will organize workshops, courses, and other events that bring these communities together.

Despite considerable recent progress, understanding SoS?s performance seems to be out-of-reach for most current techniques.  Significant progress in this area requires the synthesis of ideas and techniques from different domains, including theoretical computer science, optimization, algebraic geometry, quantum information theory and machine learning. The research plans include both theory-building and problem-solving aspects, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a complete understanding of the SoS method and related proof systems, as well as their algorithmic implications.<br/><br/>Research efforts will be directed along several thrusts: Unique Games and related problems (Small Set Expansion, Max Cut, Sparsest Cut), analysis of average-case problems (e.g., Planted Clique), applications to Machine Learning (sparse PCA, dictionary learning), algorithmic speedups of SoS, and connections to math and physics (e.g., quantum entanglement, p-spin glasses, extremal graph theory and algebraic geometry). While the main focus is on theoretical aspects, this project is also concerned with effective computational methods, and the outcomes may yield novel practical techniques for machine learning and optimization.<br/><br/>Other key features of this proposal include its strong integration with curriculum development, undergraduate research projects, and training the next wave of graduate students and postdocs and equipping them with the necessary tools to work across these areas."

Two decades of ecological experiments and theory have clearly demonstrated that biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem functioning, such that biological communities containing more species have higher levels of ecosystem function. However, virtually all of this research has been conducted at small scales and under experimentally controlled conditions that may not represent real-world ecosystems. This project will bridge the gap between the extensive knowledge scientists have developed about the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship at smaller experimental scales, and the largely unknown role of biodiversity in driving ecosystem services at the scale of real-world landscapes. The researchers will study the pollination delivered to native wildflowers by wild insect pollinators, to determine how many pollinator species are required to provide sufficient pollination to all study sites as spatial scale increases from a single plant community to an entire landscape. Specifically, they will test contrasting predictions about how the number of species required to provide adequate ecosystem services in the real world could be either more, or fewer, than that found in experiments. The results of this study will have important applications for the management of ecosystem services as well as for biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>This will be the first study to investigate how two well-known features of communities, turnover in species composition across space, and species dominance (the prevalence of a few common species and many rare ones), jointly determine the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem services at real-world scales. In order to measure real-world complexity while simultaneously controlling real-world noise, the researchers will use experimental, multi-species arrays of native plants placed throughout a 1600 km2 area as a standardized method for sampling wild pollinator communities and the pollination function they provide. Rarefaction models will be used to determine how the number of pollinator species that are important to pollination changes with increasing spatial scale, and null models will be used to remove, and thus quantify, the effect of dominance relative to that of species turnover."

These species interactions are called mutualisms, and they are thought to maintain much of the world's biodiversity. Mutualisms are also the basis for important ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pollination, and nutrient cycling. But what happens when an invasive species displaces one of the species partners in a mutualism? That is the question this project will address in the savannas of Kenya, where an invasive ant species is displacing the native ants that live on acacia trees. Native ants aggressively defend trees by attacking elephants and other herbivores that eat trees; in exchange, trees provide food (sugary nectar) and shelter (swollen thorns) for the ants. In contrast, an invasive species, big-headed ants, kill native ants but do not defend trees. Without their native bodyguards, trees are being eaten and killed by elephants more frequently. This project will assess the rate and extent of tree loss associated with the big-headed ant species invasion. Because many species of wild herbivores, including endangered black rhinos, rely on trees in one way or another, this project also aims to understand how tree loss affects habitat for wildlife. This research provides a unique opportunity to assess the domino effects of a critical species mutualism breakdown in a landscape with an abundance of elephants, giraffes, and other iconic species of large mammals. <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that the cascading effects of the invasive ant species P. megacephala on the foundational mutualism between Acacia drepanolobium and native ants are context-dependent. In savannas invaded by P. megacephala, elephants are expected to reduce tree cover, thereby lowering soil and plant nitrogen (N) and negatively affecting forage and habitat quality for wildlife (since A. drepanolobium is an N-fixer). In contrast, where elephants are absent, P. megacephala invasion should accelerate tree growth, as P. megacephala does not induce nectar production and thus may reduce metabolic costs to host plants. Over the long-term, this mutualism breakdown is predicted to lead to higher tree cover and soil N in invaded areas. This project will (1) quantify the effects of native versus invasive ants on growth, N-fixation, reproduction and biomass of trees in the presence and absence of wild herbivores, especially elephants; (2) use demographic models to project tree population growth rates; (3) use remote sensing to assess the rate of spread of the P. megacephala invasion in both wildlife-present and wildlife-extirpated areas; and (4) assess the effects of P. megacephala invasion on availability of soil and plant nutrients and resulting habitat use by wild herbivores."

Professor Montgomery is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. The goal of this project is to develop new processes for synthetic organic chemistry that are catalyzed by the earth-abundant metals nickel and copper. The new processes offer improved stability and reactivity, lower cost, and ease of access compared with existing alternatives. The new catalysts are being used to discover new organic transformations of readily available substrates. These efforts create versatile and efficient new catalysts and synthetic procedures that enable the creation of high-value products. The products are prepared from simple and widely available feedstocks in an environmentally sustainable manner. Students engaged in the work are trained in the discovery of new reactions, synthetic methods development, organometallic chemistry, and mechanistic chemistry. A substantial emphasis is placed on the career development of graduate students. Graduate students interested in employment at undergraduate institutions have they opportunity to work in that environment. Through a collaboration with a highly successful laboratory at an undergraduate institution, the graduate student gains experience conducting research and mentoring undergraduates. Other students have the opportunity to conduct collaborative research in international research labs.Professor Montgomery and his research team also are involved in outreach activities that provide engaging exposure to science for young students from the Detroit metropolitan area. These activities impact the academic experiences of many young students including underrepresented minorities while sharing with them the excitement of chemistry fields.<br/><br/>Compared with precious metal counterparts, nickel and copper catalysts offer unique reactivity and orthogonal capabilities. A primary focus of the research is to capitalize on the characteristic reactivity of nickel and copper to discover and develop synthetic processes that are unknown with other metals and that provide rapid access to high-value products. In particular, silyloxyarenes, which are an underutilized but widely available and inexpensive class of organic substrates, are employed in a wide array of carbon-hydrogen, carbon-silicon, and carbon-carbon bond-forming processes. In efforts involving copper catalysis, novel cascade processes that derivatize substrates possessing two or more unsaturated structural units are devised through processes that simultaneously incorporate multiple boron and cyano functional groups. The education plans involve innovative practices to provide career development training and international research opportunities to graduate students at the University of Michigan."

Computational Geometry, which develops efficient computer algorithms for problems stated in geometric terms, can thus play a central role in data analytics.  Traditionally, the focus in Computational Geometry was on exact algorithms with guaranteed performance on all possible inputs, including worst-case inputs. <br/><br/>This project recognizes that many practical data analysis tasks do not generate worst-case instances, and seeks to identify structural aspects of given problems that allow existing or new algorithms with better guarantees than the worst-case bounds for realistic cases, often using approximation, probabilistic analysis, parameterized complexity, or output sensitivity.<br/><br/>Understanding the huge volume of data from a combustion simulation run on a super computer gives a 3d example: Contour trees, a data structure used to summarize interactions between density or temperature isosurfaces in a simulation, take more than linear time to compute in the worst case, but by parameterizing on tree shape one can show that trees that are balanced can be computed in linear time.  Machine learning and clustering problems, like recommendation systems, give higher-dimensional examples in which one desires to extract a smaller and lower dimensional representation of the input, while preserving some feature of interest.  A geometric form of this problem is known as extracting a coreset; in the worst case the coreset size can be exponential in the dimension.  On real inputs however, there is often hidden low dimensional structure; rather than designing an algorithm whose running time depends on the worst case coreset size, the running time should adapt to the size required by the given instance.<br/><br/>Advancing non-worst-case analysis techniques helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, as there is often a disconnect between running times predicted by worst-case analysis and those seen on real data sets. The investigator will incorporate non-worst-case analysis techniques into his course curricula, as such techniques are essential yet severely lacking in standard algorithms courses. This project will also be used to support student research at the graduate as well as undergraduate levels on this topic."

Such capability would open new investigations into fundamental biological processes, the origin and progression of diseases, and ultimately the drugs and procedures for curing them. Although initially tailored to life sciences applications, VisStore can be integrated in microscopy for new devices and emerging disciplines, such as precision medicine, material sciences and semiconductors. Furthermore, VisStore has the potential to ease the transition from current workflows to fully online cloud-based ones. Furthermore, VisStore and the hierarchical streaming infrastructure have the potential to become the de-facto standard for large volumetric images.<br/> <br/>This Accelerating Innovation Technology Translation project will support R&D to build a prototype of VisStore, a plug-and-play device for easy storing, archiving, accessing, distributing, and processing massive volumetric images coming from microscopy or medical devices. It translates research discovery toward commercial applications in the microscopy market which continues to grow, topping $4.1 billion in 2014 with an anticipated CAGR growth of 7.1%, while the addressed cyber-infrastructures to reliably store, easily access, and efficiently process such data have not kept pace. This has led to a discrepancy between the quality of data that could be produced, and what actually is used, as scientists unnecessarily restrict image sizes to match computational capabilities. Brute force solutions for scaling to massive images are expensive, difficult to maintain, and require expertise usually out of reach for smaller institutions. VisStore is a combined software/hardware/cloud solution that enables ease of use for image data of any size. No more complicated than a USB drive, VisStore allows users to easily access, process, and distribute giga and terapixel 2D and 3D images within a workgroup, a company, or even globally distributed environments.<br/> <br/>The technology behind VisStore enhances the state-of-the-art for handing massive image volumes. Modern software tools often stop scaling when data size exceeds main memory, and this has been a limiting factor for microscopy imagery. When dealing with image data, the hierarchical streaming software infrastructure implemented in VisStore essentially extends the memory hierarchy of a workstation to both an external network-attached hard drive (NAS), and even cloud-based storage. With each component acting as a cache, VisStore achieves performance through on-demand data access to proprietary file layout that minimizes the amount of data transferred between levels, enabling efficient scaling to images of any size. This will support development for: (i) automated ingestion and conversion of images coming from microscopy or medical devices; (ii) a simple user interface and tool to manage local and remote storage of data; and (iii) a tool to select and export data for integration with existing workflows.<br/> <br/>The project engages the Moran Eye Center, the Associated Regional and University Pathologists, Inc. (ARUP) laboratories and the Oregon Health & Science University to develop and tests a prototype acquiring giga- and teravoxel images and test its commercial value to translate this technology from research discovery towards a commercial reality. In particular, the graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will be directly involved in these entrepreneurial activities. They will cooperate directly with the early adopters of the technology at the collaborating institutions and receive hands-on experience in how to identify and resolve their pain points and ultimately translate the raw technology into a product with commercial value."

Of particular interest is the energy transfer into the mesosphere lower thermosphere (MLT) region resulting from the coupling to the lower atmosphere, where there are violent phenomena such as thunderstorms, convective frontal activity, tornados, and other violent storm weather phenomena, as well as anthropogenic sources such as heating and air conditioning units, that will produce strong acoustic wave signals. Such energy transfer might have importance regarding a contribution to the MLT energy budget. This award provides support for the balloon flight measurements over four campaigns (one for each season) of acoustic wave activity using instrumented zero pressure balloon payloads flown to stratosphere heights near 35 km. The project is aimed at establishing the extent to which acoustic wave structures generated within the troposphere will propagate to the MLT region and produce MLT heating through acoustic wave dissipation. The balloon microphone sensors would measure the acoustic wave energy flux for frequencies within the range of 1 to 10 Hz.  A PhD graduate student and a postdoctoral associate would be supported in this award.<br/><br/>These observations would take place with launches from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill campus, which will create considerable public interest in these experiments. Each campaign would feature morning and evening flights of two balloons carrying aloft two microphones mounted in each balloon payload that would obtained acoustic waveform data that would be used in ray tracing software of acoustic wave structures to determine trajactories, occurrence rates, and wave frequency. These measurements would be obtained in four separate campaigns to measure the  seasonal and diurnal variation of the aooustic energy background. Determination of the possible effects upon the MLT region would be based upon the application of linear sound wave absorption theory following the lines of previous published work. In the case of possible complex sound waveforms as might be generated by anthropogenic sources (e.g., air conditioning systems, a more sophisticated treatment of the analysis would be carried out to determine the impact upon the MLT temperature in a quantitative way."

It will bring together theoreticians and experimentalists who study adaptive immunity in vertebrates or in bacteria. Adaptive mechanisms for immunity have evolved to mount a flexible and diverse response and to counteract the rapid evolution of pathogens to enhance organismal survival. The participants of this program work at the cutting edge of research into such immune dynamics. The goal is to foster new collaborations that build and test predictive approaches to coevolution of pathogens and the immune system. Predictive modeling is an essential component for understanding the fundamental science of the immune system. Such basic science advances will eventually enable advances in medicine. Close to half of the participants in this workshop are females, helping to increase diversity and participation of women in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The immune systems in vertebrates and in bacteria have evolved remarkable mechanisms for adapting to a diverse and constantly changing pathogenic environments. In vertebrates, new receptors are constantly generated by genomic recombination, and those that successfully detect threats are selectively amplified to protect the host. Some of the stimulated receptors are retained to form a memory of past infections, and thus to mount a rapid response against future infections of a similar type. This process of affinity maturation in an adaptive immune system constitutes a Darwinian evolution of the immune cells that occurs during the lifetime of an organism. By contrast, in some bacteria and archaea, immunity is directly acquired from interactions with the environment, and is heritable to future generations. These bacteria use the CRISPR-Cas mechanism to acquire specific genomic sequences from attacking phages (viruses that attack bacteria), and use these sequences to target future invaders. In both cases, the rapid turnover of pathogens to escape the adaptive immune response creates an evolutionary arms race at the molecular level. Understanding the complex dynamics of these adaptive immune systems in response to coevolving pathogens is only possible through a joint theoretical and experimental effort. This workshop will focus on a number of questions at this interface, including: (i) what does it mean for an immune repertoire to be ""well-adapted"", (ii) how can the actual dynamics of the adaptive system reach such a well-adapted state?, (iii) how should, and how does, the adaptive system react to an evolving pathogenic environment, and (iv) what are the molecular signatures of coevolution between viruses and the immune system, and how can we detect those from the biological data? This workshop will bring together many of the leading experts on these topics."

Current treatments for invasive and metastatic breast cancer rely on non-specific drugs that destroy both cancer and non-cancer cells such as drugs used in chemotherapy. Such drugs also have limited efficacy and severe side effects. Thus, there is a need to develop drugs that specifically destroy only cancer cells. This I-Corps team has discovered a human protein that is made in large amounts in breast cancer cells. When this protein is present in breast cancer cells, it makes cancer more deadly. For this reason, the team has developed a drug that specifically kills breast cancer cells by targeting the protein. Early studies using this drug in the treatment of aggressive breast cancer in mice has shown great promise because when mice with breast tumors are given the drug, their tumors stop growing and spreading. In addition, the use of this drug on breast cancer patients who do not have metastasis will eliminate the need for surgical removal of breast tissue and the subsequent reconstructive surgeries. <br/><br/>This I-Corps team has developed a biologic drug lead resulting in inhibition of (I) cancer cell clustering in vitro and (ii) tumor growth in vivo when administered to tumor bearing mice. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to learn how to transfer this biologic drug lead (B49) from the PI?s laboratory to the marketplace for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  This team intends to establish the current unmet needs in the metastatic breast cancer treatment space by exploring potential for product development through customer discovery, development, and risk assessment. During customer discovery, the team will conduct interviews with oncologists and all physicians involved in breast cancer treatment, biotech/pharmaceutical companies, patients, hospital administrators, insurance companies, and FDA regulators. The team will also network with other teams, investors, and partners. At the completion of this project, the team will have a clear go or no go decision regarding the viability of B49. If the decision is to move forward with developing B49, the team will draft a transition plan that includes a mission statement, objectives, products/services, keys to success, and management plan."

Professor O'Doherty is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Northeastern University. He and his group are working to develop practical synthetic approaches to oligo-cyclitols. Cyclitols are structural mimics of carbohydrates that are resistant to metabolism. In contrast to the other biological polymers (e.g., DNA and proteins), there are no practical methods for the construction of stable analogues of the oligosaccharides. To address this need, the O'Doherty group is developing a novel method of monomer assembly to prepare oligo-cyclitols. The O'Doherty group is uniquely positioned to carry out this research, as this project is based on their previously established method for the synthesis of oligosaccharides. The project provides access to novel structures for biological studies. In addition, the research program offers an excellent opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates in the state of the art methods for complex molecule synthesis.  This program impacts society at numerous levels: making carbohydrate synthesis greener, improving drug discovery, and furthering student training. <br/><br/>This research has the potential to revolutionize the way oligosaccharide structures are used in medicinal and biological chemistry studies. While methods for exo-C-glycosides syntheses have been developed, the impracticality of these syntheses has limited their use in medicinal chemistry studies. Dr. O'Doherty's approach to cyclitols (aka, endo-C-glycosides or 5a-carbasugars), mirrors the broadly successful approach to oligosaccharides, both of which rely on the use of enantio- and diastereo-selective catalytic reactions (e.g., transition metal or bimetallic catalyzed allylation). The de novo approaches start with a significantly simplified structure and sequentially increases its stereochemical and functional complexity to a range of structures, which in turn enables medicinal chemistry and chemical biology structure-activity relationship studies.

This is obviously important.  But families' life chances are also affected by where they live and how well they are able to access what they need.  Neighborhoods matter.  Research has documented how living in racially segregated communities, areas of concentrated poverty, and areas which are crime ridden place residents at an extreme disadvantage.  Past research shows the reason for these conditions is there are not organizational resources in these communities that can provide families basic services, e.g., supermarkets, clubs, churches, banks, restaurants,and pharmacies.   The purpose of this research is to understand why establishments locate where they do and if social factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, social class, crime), market forces (e.g., competition, housing prices, consumer demand), or political factors (e.g., planning) matter more.  Also, because the study period includes the Great Recession, it is possible to see how extreme conditions impacted neighborhoods' stocks of organizational resources.<br/><br/>The research posits that residents' well-being is a function of their spatial capital.  That is, do they have the ability to access locally the organizational resources they need?  Access is a function not only of families' financial and cultural capital, but also their proximity to organizational resources, location in the transportation grid, control over spatial technologies, and social traits that allow them to gain access to facilities they seeks.  However, this study recognizes the need for a better understanding of the organizations and their movement across the metroscape. The research seeks to answer two research questions.  First, what causes establishments to locate where they do in the metropolitan community?  What leads to births and growth?  What leads to deaths and decline?  The study focuses on planning and zoning initiatives by government, ecological processes, e.g., competition among organizations and forms, and community context particularly crime.  Second, what can we learn about neighborhood resilience from one metropolitan area?s experience with financial meltdown?  This project will collect data which complements ten years of research on tens of thousands of establishments and their location in the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale urbanized area.  <br/><br/>The study has broader significance, because families' access to different types of activities is important for children's educational, emotional, and social development, yet not all children have equal access to high quality programs, activities, and opportunities.  There is a spatial mismatch between supply and demand.  By focusing this research on the supply side of the market, the investigator hopes to gain a better understanding of nonprofit, for-profit, and government behaviors.   Research outcomes could potentially inform policy makers on how to motivate providers to locate/stay in under-served areas or to empower families to advocate for and provide these services. The research furthers NSF?s mission of supporting basic research and using that knowledge to improve the human condition.  While most recognize that extreme inequality is not a desirable state, we do not know what to do about it.  While it may not be possible to redistribute wealth equitably, there should be ways of making organizational resources more spatially accessible so that all residents have a chance at a healthy, happy, and prosperous life.  This research contributes to the basic knowledge necessary to address these issues.  The research also contributes to several fields of inquiry and hopefully will stimulate further research in sociology, urban planning, geography, urban economics, transportation studies, and spatial science (GIS)."

The DIME (Double-probe Instrumentation for Measuring Electric-fields) CubeSat concept builds on and further develops the NSF-funded Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE) project aimed at measuring major space weather disturbances in the upper atmosphere.  DICE was one of the first NSF CubeSat missions to be selected and flown.   The DICE project consisted of two CubeSats weighing less than 2.2 kg each.  They were launched into a low Earth orbit in October 2011 and collected data in space for two years.  Each DICE satellite carried a suite of three scientific instruments.  However, only two of them functioned successfully in space.  Due to difficulties accurately controlling the spin of the spacecraft on orbit it was not possible to deploy the long wire booms that made up the electric field instruments.  Thus, the DICE spacecraft could not provide measurements of the electric field.  Fulfilling the need for continuous global measurements of this critical parameter in upper atmosphere dynamics remains a key goal and challenge for aeronomy and space weather research.   The goal of the DIME project is to continue the development of an innovative approach to space-based measurement of the electric field.  Leveraging the successes and lessons learned from the DICE mission DIME is envisioned as the next generation low cost, highly capable ionospheric sensor-sat observatory.  New developments include improvements in the spin stabilization and control of the CubeSat, as well as improvements to the DICE electric field deployment mechanism.  The DIME development so far has been funded under the Air Force SBIR program but falls short of delivering a fully equipped satellite that is ready to be launched and provide scientific data.  Support for the purchase of the remaining parts and completion of the full flight assembly of the DIME CubeSat, and also for the completion of the satellite functional testing and calibration, while the present workforce and expertise is in place is the subject of this RAPID award.  Delivery of a fully launch-ready DIME CubeSat, will enlist support from the Air Force for the launch and operation on orbit of the satellite.  A newly graduated engineer, who worked as a student on the DICE project, in collaboration with a postdoctoral researcher, who with this project is offered a unique experimental research opportunity, will carry out most of the work under this effort.  The project also continues to foster valuable collaboration between industry, academia, and government, involving ASTRA (a small business), the Air Force Research Laboratory, and Utah State University. <br/><br/>There are three fundamental drivers of global ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) behavior: solar UV/EUV radiation, high latitude forcing from solar wind-magnetosphere interaction and coupling to the ionosphere and thermosphere, and forcing by waves and tides from the lower atmosphere.  While the principles of IT behavior are generally accepted, a complete understanding of the fully coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere system requires extensive measurements of environmental parameters that are not currently available.  What are needed are simultaneous multipoint measurements of the electric field in the ionosphere.  Focus here is on the high latitude forcing.  While E-field measurements have been available from NSF-funded ground-based radars and the DMSP satellites, there is insufficient data to enable a comprehensive specification of the key high latitude potential pattern, electric fields, and their variability in space and time.  The DIME sensor-sat has a unique potential to be a pathfinder that will pave the way for low-cost, very capable, next generation space weather CubeSat platforms from which to observe the system-driving electric field and other parameters in the Earth?s ionosphere.  Future constellations of DIME platforms could provide networked, global measurements of the electric field.  The DIME design additionally includes instrumentation to provide complementary magnetic field and plasma parameter measurements.  In this way, DIME constitutes a key step in enabling large-return Geospace science missions using CubeSat technologies, targeting outstanding unanswered system-science and space weather questions."

However, the proliferation of smartphones and the rise of social media have led to an overwhelming increase in the volume of multimedia information that must be forensically authenticated.

Prof. Sarpong is studying how to start with an organic compound called carvone, that is found in caraway seeds, spearmint, mandarin orange peels and dill, and transform it into more complex, biologically-active compounds phomactin and taxagifine.  Phomactin has activity against the proteins that lead to blood clotting, and taxagifine is closely related to the anticancer agent, taxol.  The chemical methods and strategies for molecule synthesis under investigation provide new ways to make these two natural products that may be applicable to preparing other natural product compounds.

A stereospecific total synthesis of taxagifine from carvone is being developed that provides a blueprint for the syntheses of other taxoids bearing unusual hydroxylation at carbon atoms C16 and C17."

Understanding the transition from wild to domesticated plants provides both important knowledge for crop improvement and a unique opportunity to study evolutionary change because domestication often involves selection for preferred traits. Most humans rely on crops that were domesticated from wild plants thousands of years ago, which makes it a challenge to determine the dual roles of humans and environment in domestication. Examples of people domesticating plants today may provide insights into this process. The researchers will study an ongoing relationship between seven Mexican cultural groups and weedy field mustard to get at the ecological and cultural aspects of domestication. Field mustard was domesticated in Europe and Asia and selected for many diverse forms, such as turnips, bok choi, and Chinese cabbage. It is unclear which domesticated or weedy forms were introduced to Mexico and what region they were introduced from. This project integrates information from genetic data, physical measurements, chemistry, and interviews with farmers, to study an ongoing domestication process. In addition, the project will include the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and contribute to our understanding of crop domestication, food security, and control of an invasive species.<br/><br/>Weedy Brassica rapa provides a powerful study system to elucidate plant ferality and domestication. The availability of extensive genomic tools and the plant's short life cycle facilitate the use of inferentially powerful techniques to clarify the nature of local adaptation and artificial selection of invasive field mustard across a country-wide transect of Mexico. The research involves the novel application of RNA-sequencing, reciprocal transplant experiments, glucosinolate chemistry, and semi-structured and structure interviews, to study ongoing domestication of an important food source. Data will quantify the genetic structure and introduction history of B. rapa in Mexico, local uses and management practices of field mustard by different ethnic groups, and how different management regimes drive local population adaptation of the plant."

McNeil of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry to develop catalytic, synthetic procedures to make polymers that conduct electricity with improved structural control. Conductive polymers represent an interesting subset of polymers that are used as the light-harvesting layer in solar cells, the light-emitting layer in diodes (i.e., LEDs), and the charge conducting layer in transistors.  One key advantage of conductive polymers is that they are flexible, and therefore they can be coated onto flexible substrates using simple, high-throughput technologies (e.g., ink-jet printing). Moreover, the starting materials are inexpensive. As a consequence, the conductive polymers market is rapidly growing and expected to reach 1.6 billion dollars in the US by 2017.  The goal of this research is to broaden the types of polymers that can be made, and at the same time, increase the user-friendliness of the preparation procedure. Polymers with variable composition along the polymer chain are prepared. The objective is to improve the robustness and lifetime of polymer-based solar cells.  The project may have a broader impact on the scientific community and the society at large, given that conjugated polymers are widely used for many applications.  During the course of this work, students are trained in organic, inorganic, organometallic and polymer synthesis and characterization, mechanistic organometallic chemistry, solar cell fabrication and testing. Students from historically underrepresented groups are involved in the project through participation in the Michigan Math and Science Scholars Program and the research partnership with Washtenaw Community College.<br/><br/>Gradient sequence conjugated copolymers are prepared and evaluated for use as compatibilizers in solar cells. Polymer composition, length, and sequence are all crucial factors that influence the properties of the polymer.  As a result, each application often requires different polymer structure to be synthesized.  The copolymers are prepared using palladium catalysts following a mechanism known as catalyst-transfer polycondensation (CTP). Current CTP methods, however, have many limitations, including sensitivity to oxygen and moisture and the fact that many functional groups are not tolerated, large monomers are difficult to polymerize, and few electron-deficient monomers have been polymerized.  The aim of this research is to identify chain-growth methods that are functional group tolerant and user-friendly, and to enable polymerization of large monomers containing electron-deficient arenes. Once optimized, the methods are applied to the gradient copolymer synthesis of higher-performing polymers (beyond poly (3-hexylthiophene)) with side chain fullerene for compatibilizing solar cells. The resulting mechanistic insight and catalysis discoveries may interest the synthetic organic, organometallic and polymer chemistry communities."

This I-Corps team has developed an inexpensive, yet accurate flow sensor integrated with existing inhaler devices and paired via Bluetooth technology to a smartphone; thereby, providing a monitoring and management tool for asthma and COPD. It provides substantial value for patients and healthcare providers as it streamlines data and disease management and makes COPD treatment more affordable and sustainable for both, individual patients and healthcare providers.<br/><br/>During the I-Corps program, this team will develop a viable business plan and validate market assumptions. To accomplish this goal, the team will conduct market research to understand the spectrum of needs of its primary customers which are disease management entities. The team anticipates conducting 100 interviews in approximately 22 to 30 disease management entities. At the end of the program, the team expects to have a detailed understanding of the needs of potential customers and who would be the most likely first customer segment. The team also expects to have a detailed description of how its minimum viable product should be designed to meet the needs of its customer. With this knowledge the team hopes to expedite the technical and analytical development that will go into an FDA ready device. Further this parallel path of customer development will provide clear evidence for investors to evaluate the addressable market and market size for the proposed product."

Walking with crutches requires significantly more energy than walking without a crutch, yet most of the recent advances have only focused on making crutches more comfortable.  Enhanced crutch walking efficiency is important because it can increase independence, improve stability, and reduce fatigue in the approximately six million individuals that rely on crutches for daily mobility.  This project will result in a feasible design for a kinetic crutch tip that makes crutch walking more efficient without requiring any external power.  It can also help users maintain control when walking down a slope by reducing their speed.  The kinetic crutch tip is expected to help existing crutch users gain additional mobility and allow more people to use crutches instead of wheelchairs and other more sedentary assistive devices that do not encourage the same level of daily activity.<br/><br/>This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Conventional crutch tips have a standard point or constant radius tip that cannot assist the user during walking; all forward progression forces must be generated by the user pushing themselves forward over the crutch. In contrast, the kinetic crutch tip uses a special shape to predictably redirect the user's downward force into a propulsive force that assists the individual in forward ambulation. This assistance is provided passively, so no motors or power supplies are required. The assistance force helps the individual use less energy while moving forward over level ground and when walking uphill. The crutch tip shape can be rotated to reverse the assistance force and provide a more controlled descent down a hill by reducing the user's momentum. The scientific challenge of this project lies in determining precisely what roll-over crutch tip shape should be used for each of the four commonly used crutch gait patterns and how the tip affects the gait dynamics and energy used during each crutch gait. The focus will be on the unstable and fast-moving swing-through crutch gait predominately used by short-term crutch users and on the more stable and slow-moving 2- 3- and 4-point crutch gait patterns typically used by long-term disabled individuals. The combination of engineering, physical therapy, and business start-up expertise on this project enables the development of this new method to assist individuals that rely on crutches to walk.  In addition, undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will receive experiences in innovation and entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The project engages two partners to advance this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.  Tao Life Sciences will guide the commercialization aspects by identifying the market segment(s) to focus on and will help in redesigning the research prototypes that have shown success in the lab for larger-scale testing focused on the identified customer segment.  The engineering and design related to this project will be presented to the general public through a collaboration with the Museum of Science and Industry (Tampa, FL) where an exhibit will highlight research into assistive and rehabilitation technologies. Visitors will be able try out the different types of crutches and learn about the difficulties that individuals with impairments have in performing simple daily tasks."

The materials used in the proposed design are common and devices can be manufactured in a few simple steps. Depositing a pre-mixed solution at relatively low temperatures can produce these solar cells. This type of production lends itself to ""roll-to-roll"" fabrication on lightweight, flexible materials. The use of common materials and simple production techniques has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of solar energy. In addition to large scale power generation, inexpensive, lightweight, flexible solar cells could find new applications in construction, portable power generation in disaster relief efforts, and military applications such as drones and remote power.<br/><br/>This team has developed a simple, and readily scalable, technique to rapidly and inexpensively produce large grain perovskite absorbers for perovskite solar cells. The results indicate that the large grain perovskite material this team has created results in fewer defects and increased device performance, similar to what is seen with other thin film solar cells. With all other photovoltaic (PV) devices, large grains are essential for high?]energy conversion.  The team's goal is to determine the market interest in perovskite solar cell technology. This will help them determine the best path forward with the proposed technology - should they seek to become a provider of material, a perovskite solar cell manufacturer, or just license the technology to a company already in the solar marketplace.

The main objects of study are algebraic varieties, defined by systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Such systems of equations occur throughout mathematics, science, and engineering. The idea of associating discrete or linear invariants to algebraic varieties has been intensively and successfully used in algebraic geometry to understand the properties of algebraic varieties and to classify them. This project aims to employ modern techniques that make use of the geometric properties of the variety to more fully investigate these invariants, which may lead to decisive progress towards the solution of several long-standing problems.  One of the main objectives is to understand to what extent an algebraic variety could be parametrized by independent parameters. In this direction, even the case of cubics -- varieties defined by a single equation of degree 3 in four or more variables -- is far from being completely understood. <br/><br/>The project addresses four questions. The first is about birational properties of algebraic varieties. The investigator plans to apply specialization techniques, based on properties of Chow group of zero-cycles, to quadric fibrations over rational surfaces. The second problem concerns Chow groups of cycles on algebraic varieties and the cycle class maps to the cohomology groups: integral aspects of the Hodge and Tate conjectures. These questions can be approached by computing unramified cohomology groups. The project will investigate these and related geometric properties, such as spaces of rational curves on varieties and R-equivalence. The third problem concerns Galois-theoretic invariants and local-global principles over function fields of curves. The cases of particular importance are threefolds over finite fields or abelian varieties. The last problem focuses on properties of classifying spaces of algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields."

This dissertation studies the relationship between social structure and individuals' consciousness contrasting two social theorists' (Bourdieu and Elias) theories about this society-individual relationship. This dissertation proposes that both theories have explanatory power but under different circumstances. The research site will allow the researcher to investigate how rural workers who move to urban settings start to think about things differently. This setting will allow the researcher to compare the two theories- one, Bourdieu, that sees individuals' thinking being determined by their social position; second, Elias' views of consciousness as formed in processes of people's interconnection and interactions.  To investigate the competing theories, the researcher will conduct a fieldwork study of rural migrant workers in China and, through participant observation and interviews learn how their thinking changes in very different environments.  This research contributes to integrating two sociological theories as well as addressing theoretical debates about structure and agency. It also contributes to broadening the contribution of sociology to other fields such as history.<br/><br/>Two questions thus lead this dissertation project: 1) How does Bourdieu's and Elias's mechanisms respectively operate in different social situations? 2) How do the two mechanisms co-function to shape people's consciousness of social reality? Answer these questions allows investigation of the fundamental structure-agency relationship that is a core sociological concern. These theoretical inquiries are pursued through a fieldwork study of rural migrant workers in China who are appropriate cases for two reasons. First, they experience multiple dominations as a disadvantaged group in China making it fruitful to study their consciousness of their social situations. Second, as they undergo dramatic changes when migrating to become city workers, their complicated experiences offers a rich opportunity to empirically apply both Bourdieu's and Elias's models.  The researcher will conduct one year of fieldwork in two factories in east China, including both participant observation and in-depth interviews to collect data on the migrant workers' consciousness formation in their daily work and life settings and to discuss how they are thinking about their structural situations, linking the responses more tightly to the theoretical models.  The proposed research has the potential to advance scientific knowledge in at least three ways. First, it engages two important sociological theories in an effort to integrate them. Second, the research can make important contributions to the efforts at articulating the society-agency relationships that lie at the heart of sociology. Third, the work has the capacity to speak to literatures in disciplines outside of sociology (e.g., history) that are also concerned with relationships between structure and agency."

Towards, this end, the 2016 Northwest Algal and Seagrass Symposium (NWASS) will be held from May 6-8, 2016 at the Casey Conference Center, Whidbey Island, Washington.  This conference award will sponsor 50 students from a diversity of academic institutions ranging from community colleges to research universities in the Pacific Northwest to attend the symposium as participants, poster presenters, and speakers.<br/><br/>Phycology is the scientific study of algae and aquatic plants.  Since 1984, the Northwest Algal Symposium has been a unique forum to bring together phycologists from many bioscience disciplines, including marine biology, microbiology, ecology, from both academic and government institutions in Pacific Northwest, a geographic area spanning northern California to Alaska.  The three-day symposium will have two keynote presentations, oral presentations, and poster presentations.  The first set of presentations will overview the current state of algae and seagrass diversity in the Pacific Northwest, and the second set will highlight current efforts in algal biofuel research at institutions in the Pacific Northwest.  The presentations will be delivered principally by students and post-doctoral research associates. The symposium will not have parallel sessions, but each presentation will be limited in time to maximize participation and engagement in an informal, supportive environment.  The Pacific Northwest is home to many of the highest zones of biodiversity for algae and marine plants in North America.  A unique aspect of NWASS is that the conference is situated several marine science stations and parks along the Pacific coast.  As part of the symposium activities, phycologists and algal biofuel scientists will participate in field trips with hands-on sample collection activities to see algae in their natural environment.  These relationship-building interactions will facilitate future collaborations, leading to a closer connection of the phycological research community with the algal biofuels research community."

The group studies the properties of the neutrino, the most prolific particle in the universe, about which much is still unknown. The primary effort is the search for the hypothesized, but not yet discovered, nuclear-radioactive decay called zero-neutrino double-beta decay. The existence of such a radioactive decay mode has important consequences. Its existence requires that neutrinos have mass, and that they are their own anti-particles. Most importantly, this process would require the violation of an important fundamental conservation law of elementary particle physics.  The USC group has leadership roles in two of the leading experiments in this field: the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, and the Cryogenic Underground Observatory (CUORE) in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy.  The spin-off technology from the required radiopurity of materials for the ultra-low background detectors has transitioned directly into Homeland Security.   Four past USC PhD students from the program hold important positions in Homeland Security, at the Pacific Northwest and Savannah River National Laboratories. <br/><br/><br/>CUORE, nearing completion in the LNGS, is an array of 988 tellurium oxide single-crystal bolometers that operate at ~8-10 mK to search for the zero-neutrino decay of tellurium-130 (Te-130); the detector will contain 200-kg of Te-130. The predicted half-life sensitivity is ~10^(26) years, to reach into the inverted hierarchy neutrino-mass region. USC leads part of the R&D to determine the feasibility and cost of enriching CUORE to 93% in Te-130 from 33.4%, and equipping the bolometers with Cherenkov-light detectors to discriminate against alpha-particle background. These upgrades are designed to reach the sensitivity required to cover the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. USC leads the CUORE data analysis to search for zero-neutrino double-beta decay of Te-130 to the first excited 0+ state in xenon-130, by detecting the coincidence events from the two electrons and cascade gamma rays. This technique achieved zero-background in the prototype experiment, CUORICINO. Finally, the USC group was responsible for the production of the CUORE front-end electronics, and will participate in its installation, commissioning and maintenance."

PGC works to automate labor-intensive processing workflows using the Extreme Science and Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and Blue Waters high performance computing infrastructures, and is developing a web-based imagery and geospatial product delivery system (FRIDGE; Federal Research Imagery Download and Geodata Exploration). This delivery system is based around a task management and queuing tool that interfaces with PGC?s user management database and PGC?s HPC cluster. Polar digital elevation models (DEM) will be produced using the Surface Extraction from TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM) algorithm and the Ames Stereo Pipeline. These products have an expected accuracy of 4m without ground control and sub-meter accuracy when ground control is used. A key component of PGC's mission is training of today's young geospatial students in the use of imagery to solve scientific problems. PGC offers workshops, online instructional material, and collaborative imagery processing workflow development.  PGC?s goal is to provide rapid and cost-effective access to geospatial data and education for the purpose of promoting polar science."

In the worst case, according to the predictions of some numerical models, climate change could cause large reductions in rainfall that could cause the collapse of Amazon forests. Critically needed to allow us to understand whether these models are realistic are observations of forest responses to real-world drought.  This RAPID project will measure the amount of carbon dioxide from the air above the forest that is captured by the forest, along with measurements of tree growth and death during and after the unusually strong El Nino event that is now causing drought, high temperatures, and fires across the eastern region of the Amazon along the equator. The project will be carried out in collaboration with many Brazilian scientists and students who are also working at this location. <br/><br/>Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, latent heat and sensible head will be made from the km67 eddy flux tower in the Tapajs forest near the city of Santarm, Brazil. This site has the longest combined eddy flux and forest tree dynamics record in an Amazon forest (starting in 2001). It is an ideal location for this work because it is in one of the most El Nino-sensitive areas of the South American Amazon. Results will provide much needed information about the ecological mechanisms that underlie the forest collapse models that have received so much recent attention."

About 30 of them have been observed so far and this number<br/>is steadily increasing, aided with surveys and new instruments coming online. Despite this<br/>wealth of observational knowledge, our understanding of the TDE physics, which will ultimately<br/>allow us to interpret those observations, remains rudimentary at best. In particular, we still<br/>do not understand what causes the debris to lose its energy and angular momentum, fall into<br/>the black hole and radiate. This project will make use of the fact that, at their core,<br/>TDEs are ultimately well-described by the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)<br/>equations of motion. By carrying out direct GRMHD simulations of TDEs, the project hopes to obtain a first-principles<br/>understanding of TDE physics. <br/><br/>The proposed simulations will provide answers to several long-standing<br/>questions in the TDE community: How does the debris circularize, dissipate energy, and accrete<br/>onto the SMBH? What fraction of stellar gas forms the disk, what fraction is ejected as an<br/>outflow, and how do these fractions depend on the black hole mass, spin, and the inclination<br/>of the stellar orbit? Do eccentric accretion disks form and how does angular momentum transport<br/>work in such disks? If such an eccentric disk is tilted, as is naturally expected in TDEs,<br/>does it undergo general relativistic precession? Do such disks produce relativistic jets and<br/>how? Understanding these issues will allow the community to make meaningful, quantitative<br/>interpretation of TDE observations.<br/><br/>Even though the project is focused on TDEs, it elucidates the basic<br/>physics of tilted accretion disks and their jets that is applicable to a range of sources<br/>including quasars, black hole binaries, and ultra-luminous X-ray sources. <br/>Additionally, the proposed simulations will study, from first principles<br/>and for the first time, the development of magnetorotational instability in eccentric tilted<br/>accretion disks and the long-term evolution and GR precession of such disks under continuous<br/>feeding by the debris stream.<br/><br/>Moreover, stars shredded by black holes and producing relativistic jets offer some<br/>of the most fascinating manifestations of general relativity. The project will disseminate the<br/>results obtained as part of this proposal in public talks, summer schools, radio station and<br/>newspaper interviews, and press releases. Finally, the project will involve undergraduate students in data<br/>analysis and visualization, and they will gain experience in working with Big Data, black<br/>hole accretion and jet physics, presenting their results at conferences, and publishing their<br/>work in peer-reviewed journals."

Improving feedback and assessment of students' writing is critical to U.S. efforts to compete globally. Currently, U.S. rankings for literacy have been declining over the past decade: in 2012, the Programme for International Student Assessment concluded that the U.S. literacy rate fell from 10th to 20th in the latest study on global rankings. In 2013, the College Board reported 57% of SAT takers did not qualify as college ready. The ACT found 31% of high school graduates failed to meet ACT College Readiness Benchmarks, and the most recent NAEP Writing Report determined 73% of 12th graders received scores of Below Basic or Basic as opposed to Proficient or Advanced in 2011. Few educators or students dispute the importance of quality feedback on students? writing. However, over the past 100 years, researchers have repeatedly found that teachers' grades lack validity and reliability; that teachers' comments on papers often lack helpful, critical commentary; and that students do not know how to critique other students' writing even though they are frequently assigned peer-reviews. While teachers? shared use of rubrics has led to improved inter-rater agreement scores?especially in testing situations where teachers can practice scoring to reach stronger levels of consensus?comparisons of teachers' scores across sections of the same course in authentic learning contexts has found great variance in teachers' scores and comments.<br/><br/>This research seeks to help expedite document markup, peer-review, team-project, eportfolio, and writing-assessment processes; empower instructors and students to provide more helpful, timely feedback; better prepare students for peer reviews and team projects; and enable high schools, colleges, and universities to more accurately assess learning, improve retention, and prepare accreditation reports. Ultimately, this research aspires to conceptualize digital tools that will enable the U.S. to complete on global measures of cognitive, interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies. During the I-Corps program, the team will interview academic stakeholders (writing program administrators, faculty, and university administrators who are concerned with retention and business stakeholders (technical writing firms, competitors, and NLP researchers)?to evaluate mockups for writing analytics, student-retention alerts, data visualizations, and intelligent tutoring systems. For example, the team will ask writing program administrators if they would be likely to adopt and use tools that provide inter-rater agreement reports on instructors? scores in relation to students' peer-review scores or lexical analysis of the instructors? and students? written commentaries. Additionally, the team will hold focus groups with instructors and students to ascertain the helpfulness of NLP-based reports that vet peer reviews. Ultimately, this research will explore the efficacy of second-generation digital tools?i.e., tools that provide writing analytics that give information back to users based on their use of a tool, such as lexical analysis of comments, reports of inter-rater agreement among reviewers, reports that analyze the length and quality of feedback, or badges that incentivize quality reviews.

The overall goal of this project is to dramatically expand our knowledge of the species diversity, distribution, ecological function, and organismal biology of Aigarchaeota and to establish a taxonomic classification for the entire group. More generally, this project aims to set a precedent for the investigation of poorly studied microbial biodiversity and integration of biodiversity research on microbes into a meaningful taxonomy.  This project will support a variety of researchers at Minority-Serving Institutions and Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and will provide research opportunities for students who are underrepresented in science. In addition, this project will contribute to an educational outreach program that provides content knowledge to K-12 students and teachers throughout from Clark County School District, and provide high-school teachers the opportunity to participate in a workshop and field excursion to collect samples for microbial analysis.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on two major study sites, Great Boiling Spring in northwest Nevada, and springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, but also includes investigations of terrestrial and marine geothermal systems worldwide. The specific aims are: 1) To discover new Aigarchaeota taxa and erect a candidate taxonomic structure, 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from natural samples and mined from databases will be combined with single-cell genomic and metagenomic datasets; phylogenetics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics, and ecological niche modeling will be integrated to erect a candidate taxonomic structure; 2) To assess the function of Aigarchaeota, stable isotope labeling experiments, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, and metaproteomics will test explicit hypotheses about Aigarchaeota metabolism, providing a window into how Aigarchaeota organisms function in nature; and 3) To cultivate, isolate, and describe Aigarchaeota pure cultures, enrichment cultures will be established in the laboratory and used to try to isolate and describe axenic cultures by using both traditional and innovative approaches. The combination of large-scale data mining, phylogenetics, taxonomy, ecological niche modeling, and field and wet lab work described here spans all components of the Systematics and Biodiversity Sciences Cluster and aims to transform our knowledge of a major lineage of Archaea and provide insight into species- to domain-level evolution."

Chemosynthetic microorganisms use the energy generated by oxidizing reduced inorganic chemicals contained in the vent fluids, like hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen gas, to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into cell material. By doing so, they effectively transfer the energy from a geothermal source to higher trophic levels, in the process supporting the unique and fascinating ecosystems that are characterized by high productivity - oases in the otherwise barren deep ocean landscape. While the general view of the functioning of these ecosystems is established, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the microbiology and biogeochemistry of these systems. Particularly lacking are studies measuring rates of microbial activity in situ, which is ultimately needed to understand production of these ecosystems and to assess their impact on global biogeochemical cycles. This project makes use of the Vent-Submersible Incubation Device (Vent-SID), a robotic micro-laboratory that was recently developed and tested in the field. This instrument makes it possible for the first time to determine rates of carbon fixation at both in situ pressures and temperatures, revolutionizing the way we conduct microbial biogeochemical investigations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. This is an interdisciplinary and collaborative effort between two US and foreign institutions, creating unique opportunities for networking and to foster international collaborations. This will also benefit two graduate students working in the project, who will get exposed to a wide range of instrumentation and scientific fields, facilitating their interdisciplinary education.  In collaboration with Dr. Nitzan Resnick, academic dean of The Sage School, an elementary school outreach program will be developed and a long-term partnership with the school established. Further, a cruise blog site to disseminate the research to schools and the broader public will be set up. The results will be the topic of media coverage as well as be integrated into coursework and webpages existing either in the PI's labs or at the institution.<br/><br/>This project is using a recently developed robotic micro-laboratory, the Vent-SID, to measure rates of chemoautotrophic production and to determine the relative importance of oxygen and nitrate in driving chemosynthesis at deep-sea hydrothermal vents at in situ pressures and temperatures and to tackle the following currently unresolved science objectives: 1) obtain in situ rates of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation, 2) obtain in situ nitrate reduction rate measurements, and 3) directly correlate the measurement of these processes with the expression of key genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism. Although recent data suggests that nitrate reduction either to N2 (denitrification) or to NH4+ (dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium) might be responsible for a significant fraction of chemoautotrophic production, NO3-reduction rates have never been measured in situ at hydrothermal vents. The researchers hypothesize that chemoautrophic growth is strongly coupled to nitrate respiration in vent microbial communities. During a cruise that will take place approximately 12 months into the project (~Feb 2017), the researchers will carry out a total of 4 deployments of the Vent-SID as well as ancillary sampling collection at the 946N to 953N segment of the East Pacific Rise. They will focus efforts on two diffuse-flow vent sites, ""Crab Spa"" and ""Teddy Bear"". ""Crab Spa"" is a diffuse flow vent site (T: 25C) that has been used as a model system to gain insights into chemoautotrophic processes and has been frequently sampled over the last several years. This vent site has been very well characterized, both geochemically and microbiologically, providing excellent background data for the proposed process oriented studies. ""Teddy Bear"" is a diffuse-flow site that was discovered in Jan 2014, and it has a lower temperature (T: 12C), making it a good comparative site. The researchers will perform a number of short duration time-course incubations to assess the role of different environmental parameters that have been identified as likely key variables (e.g., O2, temperature, NO3-), and to link these process rate measurements to the expression of functional genes using metatranscriptomic analyses. This study will be the first attempt to measure critical metabolic processes of hydrothermal vent microbial assemblages under critical in situ conditions and to assess the quantitative importance of electron donor and acceptor pathways in situ. In the future, it is envisioned that the Vent-SID will become a routine application by the oceanographic community for measuring time series rates of relevant metabolic processes at hydrothermal vents under in situ pressures and vent fluid temperatures."

Fires impact ecosystem services provided by the tundra for decades to centuries by burning the vegetation and the layer of dead organic matter on top of the soil. As vegetation rapidly recolonizes the landscape after a fire through a process known as succession, its composition changes, as do the cycles of carbon and associated nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus. In fact, fires remove a large portion of nutrients needed to fuel the regrowth and recovery of vegetation, while at the same time, increase soil temperatures because the insulating organic layer has also been removed. Warmer soils may increase soil nutrient availability and lead a shift from grasses to shrubs over time. But it is unclear whether these changes are large enough to offset the initial carbon and nutrient losses during the fires, which is the main question this project seeks to answer. Besides the scientific results, an online documentary series will be produced that explains the effects of climate change and fire on arctic ecosystems. Formal outreach programs developed in prior projects that specifically address indigenous and minority populations living on the North Slope in Alaska and in Indiana will also be enhanced.<br/><br/>This project will develop a multi-decadal record and mathematical model of post-fire carbon and nutrient cycling across three sites along a disturbance severity gradient within the largest recorded arctic tundra fire, the Anaktuvuk River fire from 2007. An existing eddy covariance system will be used to continue measurements of carbon and energy fluxes begun in 2008, along with soil chambers. A quantitative soil and biomass harvest was conducted in 2011 across a burn severity gradient. Post-fire trajectories from grass to shrub-dominated tundra should create a positive climatic feedback and produce a warming effect through decreased albedo. This project will be used to create a multi-decadal record of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes and stocks to parameterize, validate, and test the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL) model as applied to the biogeochemistry of arctic tundra."

This is also the region where Norse settlements were abandoned by the early-15th century; many questions still remain about the causative factors. Although climate change is often cited as the reason for settlement failure, this explanation rests on a very poorly constrained scientific foundation and other explanations have also been proposed.   Inferences about climatic conditions in the region often have been derived from far distant sources, generally at high elevations on the Greenland Ice Sheet, where climatic conditions are completely different.  This project will produce records with multidecadal (15-25 year) resolution from the study region, spanning the last 1500-2000 years.  This will be accomplished using new organic geochemical techniques and will contribute to the calibration and understanding of these methodologies.  <br/><br/>This project will partially support a productive young scientist during the formative years of her career.  It will also provide support for the training of a graduate student.  The principal investigators (PIs) will contribute to a University of Massachusetts summer program designed to engage 12 to 18 year old girls, most from under-represented or low income groups, in STEM fields.  The PIs and the supported graduate student will participate in university-sponsored middle and high school teacher training programs.  Finally, undergraduate honors students often participate in the activities of co-PI's lab.  She expects that a number of honors theses and senior projects will result from the research associated with this project.  All of this contributes to development of the nation's STEM workforce.  The project will continue an established international collaboration with French scientists.  The disappearance of the Norse communities in Greenland and its potential linkage to climate change have significant human interest upon which the PIs propose to capitalize.  Their proposed outreach activities include composing articles for popular science magazines and development of a project web site.  It is also anticipated that the PI will continue his productive interactions with the local media, both print and electronic.<br/><br/>This project will generate new high resolution, quantitative records of temperature and hydrology for the past 2,000 years from lakes in coastal regions of southern and southwestern Greenland, an area that has important links to the broader climate dynamics of the North Atlantic.  It also will shed light on climatic fluctuations during the period of Norse settlement in the region. Novel organic geochemical techniques will be used for past temperature reconstruction (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) and for estimates of changes in evaporation (leaf wax deuterium isotopes) over time."

A major challenge in these fields is to identify causal influences in the networks.  Experimentation can directly determine causal influences.  However, it can be more costly and less practical than passively recording activity in the network and inferring influences from those observations.  There are numerous methods that can identify correlations from observational data, though identifying causal relationships often requires expert knowledge or strong modeling assumptions.  There is a need for computationally efficient and statistically robust causal inference methods to extract relevant information from network time-series data to facilitate human analysis.<br/><br/>This research aims to significantly advance the state of the art in inferring causal influences between time-series.  The research develops new and efficient algorithms to learn and approximate the structure of a recently proposed probabilistic graphical model: the directed information graph.  The algorithms find optimal or near-optimal approximations of the network topology that have user-controlled sparsity levels, such as the number of edges in the graph or the amount of computation performed.  The quality of approximation is measured using Kullback-Leibler divergence.  The work also involves proving correctness of the algorithms and developing variations that find provably-good approximations which are robust to noisy or limited data.  To achieve these goals, the project develops new bounds for directed information."

These deposits also commonly contain some of the world's most important ore deposits.  Exposed deposits in South Africa, Greenland, USA, Canada, and Antarctica have led researchers to propose that the bigger the magma body, the faster it will crystallize.  While this might seem counter-intuitive (typically it is thought that more magma = hotter = harder to cool), the comparison of these exposures show that bigger magma chambers maintain a molten top that is always in contact with the colder crust; whereas smaller magma chambers insulate themselves by crystallizing at the margins.  The process is similar to the difference between a large cup of coffee with no lid, and a smaller cup of coffee held in a thermos.  The large unprotected cup of coffee will cool down much faster than that held in the thermos.  This research project of VanTongeren and Schoene will use previously collected rocks from the large (~8-9 km thick) Dufek Intrusion in Antarctica to precisely quantify how fast the magma chamber crystallized, and compare that rate to the much smaller magma chamber exposed in the Skaergaard Intrusion of E. Greenland.  The work is an important step towards improving our understanding of time-scales associated with the thermal and chemical evolution of nearly all magma chambers on Earth, which will ultimately lead to better predictions of volcanic hazards globally.  The work will also yield important insights into the timescales and conditions necessary for developing vast magmatic ore deposits, which is essential to the platinum and steel industries in the USA and abroad.<br/><br/>Based on observations of solidification fronts in six of the world's most completely exposed layered mafic intrusions, it was recently proposed that bigger magma chambers must crystallize faster than small magma chambers.  While this is initially counter-intuitive, the hypothesis falls out of simple heat balance equations and the observation that the thickness of cumulates at the roofs of such intrusions is negatively proportional to the size of the intrusion. In this study, VanTongeren and Schoene will directly test the hypothesis that bigger magma chambers crystallize faster by applying high precision U-Pb zircon geochronology on 5-10 samples throughout the large Dufek Intrusion of Antarctica.   Due to uncertainties in even the highest-precision ID-TIMS analyses, the Dufek Intrusion of Antarctica is the only large layered mafic intrusion on Earth where this research can be accomplished.  VanTongeren and Schoene will place the geochronological measurements of the Dufek Intrusion into a comprehensive petrologic framework by linking zircon crystallization to other liquidus phases using mineral geochemistry, zircon saturation models, and petrologic models for intrusion crystallization.  The research has the potential to radically change the way that we understand the formation and differentiation of large magma bodies within the shallow crust.  Layered intrusions are typically thought to cool and crystallize over very long timescales allowing for significant differentiation of the magmas and reorganization of the cumulate rocks.  If the 'bigger magma chambers crystallize faster hypothesis' holds this could reduce the calculated solidification time scales of the early earth and lunar magma oceans and have important implications for magma chamber dynamics of active intraplate volcanism and long-lived continental arcs.  Furthermore, while the Dufek Intrusion is one of only two large layered intrusions exposed on Earth, very little is known about its petrologic evolution.  The detailed geochemical and petrologic work of VanTongeren and Schoene based on analyses of previously collected samples will provide important observations with which to compare the Dufek and other large magma chambers."

Unlike other brain information such as the structural and sequential dimensions that have all been extensively studied with models and methods successfully developed, the 5th dimension, dynamics, has only very recently started receiving systematic analysis from the research community. The state-of-the-art models suffer from several fundamental limitations that have critically inhibited the accuracy and reliability of the dynamic parameters' computation. First, dynamic parameters are derived from each voxel of the brain spatially independently, and thus miss the fundamental spatial information since the brain is ?connected?. Second, current models rely solely on single-patient data to estimate the dynamic parameters without exploiting the big medical data consisting of billions of patients with similar diseases. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a framework for data-driven brain dynamics characterization, modeling and evaluation that includes the new concept of a 5th dimension - brain dynamics - to complement the structural 4-D brain for a complete picture. The project studies how dynamic computing of the brain as a distinct problem from the image reconstruction and de-noising of convention models, and analyzes the impact of different models for the dynamics analysis. A data-driven, scalable framework will be developed to depict the functionality and dynamics of the brain. This framework enables full utilization of 4-D brain spatio-temporal data and big medical data, resulting in accurate estimations of the dynamics of the brain that are not reflected in the voxel-independent models and the single patient models. The model and framework will be evaluated on both simulated and real dual-dose computed tomography perfusion image data and then compared with the state-of-the-art methods for brain dynamics computation by leveraging collaborations with Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and Northwell School of Medicine at Hofstra University. The proposed research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in quantifying and analyzing brain structure and dynamics, and the interplay between the two for brain disease diagnosis, including both the acute and chronic diseases. This unified approach brings together fields of Computer Science, Bioengineering, Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroradiology to create a framework for precisely measuring and analyzing the 5th dimension - brain dynamics - integrated with the 4-D brain with three dimensions from spatial data and one dimension from temporal data. Results from the project will be incorporated into graduate-level multi-disciplinary courses in machine learning, computational neuroscience and medical image analysis. This project will open up several new research directions in the domain of brain analysis, and will educate and nurture young researchers, advance the involvement of underrepresented minorities in computer science research, and equip them with new insights, models and tools for developing future research in brain dynamics in a minority serving university."

Global production of aluminum from bauxite ore currently accounts for 1% of global electricity consumption, and 2.5% of CO2 emission. Over the last 15 years global production has doubled, and is expected to continue to increase over the next decades with expanded use in automotive applications. To meet increasing demand while reducing the environmental impact of production requires cost effective means of removing contaminating metals such as iron from aluminum. Commercial application of the technologies investigated here would positively affect the global aluminum industry and reduce its environmental impact. Applied to conventional primary production, the technology can be used to increase the yield from bauxite, or allow kaolinite clays to be used for primary production. The former will reduce the environmental and economic costs of production, while the latter would allow domestic producers to reduce their reliance on imported bauxite. If the technology is applied to primary production using carbothermic reduction, the impacts on the global aluminum industry would be even greater. Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by up to 50%, and electricity consumption reduced by up to 20%.<br/><br/><br/>The objective of this Phase II SBIR research is to demonstrate a cost effective barrier centrifuge technology to remove contaminating elements from aluminum alloys. In the Phase I research we demonstrated the basic technology using a liquid gallium alloy instead of aluminum. In Phase II, we will fabricate an apparatus for handling liquid aluminum and characterize its purification efficiency and costs to own and operate. Using the barrier centrifuge to purify aluminum in secondary production would reduce the need for dilution by primary aluminum, thereby reducing the demand for the primary aluminum with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption, greenhouse gas production and waste disposal needs from the bauxite refining process."

Examples include the persistent northerly and southerly flows on opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains in North America and the Andes Mountains in South America, and the easterly flow that surrounds Antarctica. The goal of this project is to understand what causes these jets and to study their impacts on climate.  Previous work developed a two-dimensional theory which explains such jets as a balanced dynamical response of the atmosphere in response to forcing by solar heating and infrared radiative cooling of the elevated terrain.  Computed results using simplified terrain profiles showed qualitative agreement with observed winds in two-dimensional cross sections through the Andes and Antarctica.  <br/><br/>This project will extend the theory to three dimensions, taking into account the effects of the earth's spherical shape and the full shape of the elevated terrain.  Solutions of the resulting equations will be computed using a novel numerical method which refines the grid where needed to obtain accurate solutions with minimal computational work.  Solutions will be computed for jets associated with several regions of complex terrain around the globe, such as Antarctica, the Tibetan Plateau, Greenland, and the Rockies and Andes, and validated by comparison with observational data.<br/><br/>Beyond developing our fundamental understanding of atmospheric dynamics, this work has societal relevance due to the importance of low-level jets for regional climate.

This project will also contribute to developing the future scientific workforce by supporting and training two graduate students in research, and training one undergraduate student in computational mathematics and modern scientific programming.

The initial focus is on largemouth bass, the most popular sportfish in the United States (an estimated 12-18 million anglers).  The underlying technology, however, will be applicable to many other fish species and aquatic animals.  For the angler (user base #1), lure selection is critical to success and enjoyment.  Because fish see quite differently than humans, and their visual perception varies dramatically depending on lighting environments and habitat, the human eye cannot predict how bass will perceive a lure.  To improve the fishing experience, this I-Corps team will create an application that allows anglers to estimate how a given lure appears to bass in a given environment, and estimates the maximum distance at which a bass can see the lure.  For the lure manufacturer (user base #2), the technology can be used to develop lures with known levels of perception targeted for specific habitats?not only increasing the success of the lures but also adding significant marketing advantages.  In the field of animal management and conservation (user base #3), the technology ultimately promises a greater understanding of perception among a variety of species, leading to better decisions and practices to preserve and enhance ecosystems.<br/><br/>Recreational angling is a multi-billion dollar industry, and largemouth bass are the most popular target for anglers. An estimated $6.1 billion is spent annually just on rods, reels, tackle boxes, etc. Another $100 million is spent on fishing magazines, books, and DVDs. 11.2 million people fish for black bass annually, and another 7.3 million fish for related sunfish species. At this time the team is not aware of any product on the market that take a scientific approach to estimating how bass perceive objects in their environment, or that use the knowledge base of fish vision capabilities to make effective lures. Participation in the I-Corps program will enable the team to investigate the market from many viewpoints. The team will learn what channels lures and fish attraction products take from manufacture to user in the recreational market area. The team also needs to connect with all types of recreational anglers, as well as commercial fisherman. If fish can be caught by specific lures based on the knowledge of their visual systems, it could mean that using fish specific lure systems in a commercial setting could eliminate the gathering of non-target species of all kinds, called the by-catch, preventing the situation in which fish other than those desired are collected via the fishing methods used, and then discarded as waste. At the end of the project, the team will decide if a SBIR would be useful to obtain, and also gain insight into what business entity or license strategy to use for commercial market entry."

The project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter to study the organization of biological membranes. The modeling efforts will develop new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations. The current understanding of how multi-component giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) respond to osmotic pressure differentials is incomplete, and experimental observations indicate that a non-linear model coupling membrane dynamics with 3D fluid flow is needed to fully explain the non-linearities of the system. Developing this theoretical framework and providing insight into the underlying physics is crucial for the understanding of how membranes undergo morphological transitions. These models will explain existing experiments and also predict membrane response to different osmotic loads and membrane compositions. Understanding this process is important for better experimental design of in vitro reconstituted systems such as vesicles and also cellular systems. The work is inherently interdisciplinary, using mathematics and physics in biological systems. Both fields will benefit from this approach to studying biological phenomena; the theory will be grounded in experiments and also make predictions to design future experiments. This research will be integrated into the teaching efforts of the PIs in developing new courses at the interface of engineering and biology. The PIs will continue their efforts in enhancing diversity in the UC system while pursuing the research program. <br/><br/>Biological membranes are inherently heterogeneous mixtures of lipids and proteins. A key characteristic of this heterogeneity is the coexistence of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. This coexistence is thought to be the key organizing principle for the formation of lipid rafts. Studying the formation and organization of the different phases in cellular system is experimentally challenging, given the complex nature of the cells. Giant unilamellar vesicles with controlled compositions, allow us to study lipid behavior in bilayer membranes and gain insight into phase behavior which is important for understanding cellular membranes. Although GUVs are used widely experimentally, our theoretical understanding of lipid phase separation remains rudimentary, since existing models focus on the line tension between preexisting domains and not on domain growth and swell-burst cycles, which are the features observed experimentally. The objectives of this project are to formulate quantitative models of isothermal phase separation and swell-burst cycle in multi-component GUVs and test model predictions experimentally. STUDY 1-DYNAMICS OF SOLUTE EFFLUX. We will use theory, simulations, and experiments to understand the factors that control pore radius, vesicle radius, and the lifetime of the pore. STUDY 2-PHASE SEPARATION IN OSMOTICALLY STRESSED VESICLES. Using a viscoelastic model of multi-component lipid membranes, we will investigate the role of governing energetics in domain growth versus true phase transitions. We will experimentally test the model predictions by tuning the osmotic pressure difference, lipid composition, and sample temperature. STUDY 3-COUPLING BETWEEN DOMAIN FORMATION AND SWELL-BURST CYCLES. In this study, we will develop the mathematical framework to model the complete dynamics of the oscillatory phase separation coupled with the swell-burst cycle observed in the preliminary experiments. This model will combine the dynamics of pore formation outlined in Study 1, with the domain growth model including membrane viscosity in Study 2. The significance of the proposed activities lies in its promise to not only elucidate the fundamental properties of mixtures of lipids reduced dimensional, bilayer configuration but also furnish design principles for designing synthetic protocellular compartments for applications spanning in vitro production of proteins, chemistry in confinement, and delivery of biomedically relevant cargo (e.g., enzymes, drugs, and imaging agents). Using a combination of theory, simulations and experiments, this work will be able to provide insight into the complexities of lipid membranes. The long-term impact of the proposed activities stems from the fact that the project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter. The modeling efforts outlined here will result in new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations."

Hartwig in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. In this program, Professor Hartwig is developing a mechanistic understanding of catalytic reactions that use transition metal complexes bonded to fluorine-containing alkyl groups. These studies answer a series of questions about the impact of fluorine atoms on the metal-bound carbon atom.  The studies also assess several approaches to control the reactivity of these fluoroalkyl complexes of transition metals. By developing methods to control the reactivity of fluoroalkyl complexes, this research enables the development of new catalytic reactions that add fluoroalkyl groups into organic molecules. Organic molecules containing fluorine are vital to materials, agricultural, and medicinal sciences. For example, over 20% of new pharmaceuticals and 25% of licensed herbicides contain fluorine. The project is well suited for providing a broad education to Ph.D. scientists and undergraduates, including those of underrepresented groups. A series of outreach activities for K-12 students, the general public, and the general scientific community are part of Professor Hartwig's efforts resulting from the research program.<br/><br/>Although a large fraction of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals contain fluorine, fluorinated structures are largely limited to those derived from simple fluoroarenes, trifluoromethylarenes or trifluoroacetates. Many of the potential methods to synthesize more diverse structures containing fluoroalkyl groups require new approaches to induce and control the reactivity of fluoroalkyl transition-metal complexes in catalytic reactions. This research creates these capabilities by demonstrating, by a combination of kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions and synthesis of catalytic intermediates, how to induce productive reactivity in fluoroalkyl complexes of palladium.  This project also creates new catalytic reactions that couple partially fluorinated alkyl groups to aromatic and heteroaromatic molecules to form products that are difficult to access by current synthetic methods. With this information, fluoroalkylation reactions that are currently stoichiometric are being made catalytic.  Additionally, new reactions of aryl halides that form fluoroalkylarenes with novel structures that are difficult to prepare by alternative methods are being created. This research enables the preparation of new classes of fluorinated molecules for materials science, medicinal chemistry, and agroscience. As part of the educational plan, Professor Hartwig teaches short-courses for those lacking formal training in organometallic catalysis, co-authors a sophomore organic text that includes content on catalysis in medicinal and green organic chemistry, and delivers lectures to general audiences, predominantly in forums in which he reaches potential scientists from underrepresented groups."

The system is called AGV-3D, and it is important because it enhances current AGV technology, which in turn improves the efficiency of U.S. manufacturing by providing a reliable and safe means of meeting material movement demands.  The project will result in an AGV-3D prototype being integrated into an actual AGV system, and demonstrated in a representative warehouse environment.  AGV-3D has the following unique features: it integrates the latest in 3D imaging technologies to enable robust and accurate localization of an AGV vehicle in a large-scale warehouse facility without the integration of wires, magnets, or reflectors in the environment. These features provide the following advantages: lower per-vehicle cost, lower facility installation cost, and increased facility flexibility when compared to the leading competing 2D laser guidance technology in this market space.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The first significant challenge is that the required positioning accuracy of AGVs is on the order of 1 cm.  The second is that the localization system must be extremely robust as AGV warehouse installations require very high levels of availability.  Unfortunately, correctly associating landmark features will be far more difficult as unlike current 2D laser guidance technologies, artificial retroreflector targets will not be installed in the environment.  Thus, there are significant challenges in both data association and reconstruction.   To meet these challenges, AGV-3D leverages 3D data for both mapping the environment and landmark feature segmentation.  First, a 3D reconstruction of the facility is created to extract salient natural features as landmarks.  Next, a map-based localization approach leverages 3D LIDAR to enable 3D feature-to-landmark matching which minimizes the potential for data association errors.  By employing the latest in 3D sensor systems, AGV vehicles will be able to track these 3D features in real-time.  In conjunction with the map-based localization approach, centimeter level accuracy is expected.  In addition, graduate students involved in this project will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through system development, and through direct interactions with companies in the robotics, AGV, and 3D sensing spaces."

The workshop will open up opportunities for future multi-disciplinary research by supporting the formation of an umbrella organization for ongoing research in the region, strengthening linkages between researchers, and allowing members to develop collaborative research agendas. International students and early career researchers are also well represented, enhancing the network's capacity for future growth. A wider outcome of the workshop and network will be to inform decision-makers in the region of the results of on-going research, contributing scientifically robust evidence to better inform debate among policymakers and the public. In addition to a multi-disciplinary, landscape-scale situation analysis, the workshop will generate a series of policy briefs to facilitate the dissemination of outputs to non-academic audiences.<br/><br/>The project engages the concept of resilience and will use the workshop to advance the idea of resilience assessment. An objective of the workshop and research network will be to ascertain whether the large-scale land-use change occurring in the Omo-Turkana region supports the economic and social goals declared by project planners, or whether economic growth is being prioritized over the quality and resilience of environmental and social systems. Given the landscape-wide impact of development in the Omo-Turkana Basin, a theoretical basis is required that integrates contributions from multiple disciplines and therefore represents all elements of a social-ecological system. Resilience is one such theory, and this project will contribute to the literature by using the strong representation of social and political sciences in the network to better address equity and power relations within a resilience framing. Such a framing has generalizable relevance for other contexts, and as such, should be useful to science and society well beyond the specific case at hand."

At the peak of the last ice age 25,000 years ago, sea level was 120 meters (400 feet) lower than it is at present because water that is now part of the ocean was instead part of expanded glaciers and ice sheets in North America, Eurasia, and Antarctica. Between then and now, melting and retreat of this land ice caused sea level to rise. In this project, we aim to improve our understanding of how changes in the size of the Antarctic Ice Sheet contributed to this process. The overall strategy to accomplish this involves (i) visiting areas in Antarctica that are not now covered by ice; (ii) looking for geological evidence, specifically rock surface and sediment deposits, that indicates that these areas were covered by thicker ice in the past; and (iii) determining the age of these geological surfaces and deposits. This project addresses the final part of this strategy -- determining the age of Antarctic glacial rock surfaces or sediment deposits -- using a relatively new technique that involves measuring trace elements in rock surfaces that are produced by cosmic-ray bombardment after the rock surfaces are exposed by ice retreat. By applying this method to rock samples collected in previous visits to Antarctica, the timing of past expansion and contraction of the ice sheet can be determined. The main scientific outcomes expected from this project are (i) improved understanding of how Antarctic Ice Sheet changes contributed to past global sea level rise; and (ii) improved understanding of modern observed Antarctic Ice Sheet changes in a longer-term context.  This second outcome will potentially improve predictions of future ice sheet behavior. Other outcomes of the project include training of individual undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the development of a new course on sea level change to be taught at Tulane University in New Orleans, a city that is being affected by sea level change today.<br/><br/>This project will use measurements of in-situ-produced cosmogenic carbon-14 in quartz from existing samples collected at several sites in Antarctica to resolve major ambiguities in existing Last Glacial Maximum to present ice sheet reconstructions. This project is important because of the critical nature of accurate reconstructions of ice sheet change in constraining reconstructions of past sea level change. Although carbon-14 is most commonly exploited as a geochronometer through its production in the upper atmosphere and incorporation into organic materials, it is also produced within the crystal lattice of rocks and minerals that are exposed to the cosmic-ray flux at the Earth's surface. In this latter case, its concentration is proportional to the duration of surface exposure, and measurements of in-situ-produced carbon-14 can be used to date geological events that form or expose rock surfaces, for example, ice sheet expansion and retreat. Although carbon-14 is one of several trace radionuclides that can be used for this purpose, it is unique among them in that its half-life is short relative to the time scale of glacial-interglacial variations. Thus, in cases where rock surfaces in polar regions have been repeatedly covered and uncovered by ice sheet change during many glacial-interglacial cycles, carbon-14 measurements are uniquely suited to accurately dating the most recent episode of ice sheet advance and retreat.  We aim to use this property to improve our understanding of Antarctic Ice Sheet change at a number of critically located sites at which other surface exposure dating methods have yielded ambiguous results. Geographically, these are focused in the Weddell Sea embayment of Antarctica, which is an area where the geometry of the Antarctic continent potentially permits large glacial-interglacial changes in ice volume but where existing geologic records of ice sheet change are particularly ambiguous.  In addition, in-situ carbon-14 measurements, applied where independently constrained deglaciation chronologies already exist, can potentially allow us to date the last period of ice sheet advance as well as the most recent retreat."

Researchers have identified Statics as a major impediment for students to succeed in follow-on core courses (therefore affecting retention in engineering) as well as on practical design capstone courses. It is known that students enter Statics with misconceptions that are not corrected through traditional instruction. This project investigates the use of feedback devices, known as haptics, in which students can manipulate a computer-generated structure and feel the forces that are generated. It is hypothesized that the use of the haptic device will provide students specific feedback to help them develop a better conceptual understanding of Statics. This project targets a foundational topic in engineering education known to significantly affect both future performance and retention. The results of this research are broadly relevant to institutions and their students, as essentially all students in mechanical, civil, aerospace, and biomedical disciplines take Statics. Similarly, the products of this research inform learning interventions in related concepts in science and engineering (e.g., buoyancy, electricity and magnetism, and dynamics, among others).<br/><br/>This research advances understanding of haptic-mediated learning by exploring specific affordances and constraints of visuo-haptic simulations in a laboratory experiment emphasizing statics misconceptions. Visuo-haptic simulation using force-feedback devices for education is timely, yet understudied. This research significantly extends the community's understanding of the affordances and constraints of using haptic devices for teaching difficult concepts. Following a design-based research approach, this project develops new knowledge about how haptic-based learning experiences can mediate conceptual understanding and representational competence of difficult concepts in statics. It investigates how we can best use touch technologies to help students connect system behaviors in terms of governing forces and their different representational forms. This proposal focuses on the following specific research questions (RQs): <br/>1. To what extent do haptic-based learning experiences improve student conceptual understanding and representational fluency? Working hypothesis: the force feedback of haptic devices reinforces representations (mathematical, visual) of mechanics systems and improves conceptual understanding. <br/>2. How do the short-term, long-term, and transfer learning gains between visual-only-enhanced, physical manipulative-enhanced, and haptic-enhanced learning activities compare?

What are the differences in students' explanations and representations of experienced phenomena before and after using the haptic-based learning experiences? Working hypothesis: haptic devices and learning experiences provide a new platform on which students can build understanding, and provide a new vocabulary for articulating device structure, function, and performance. <br/><br/>The newly derived knowledge will inform our understanding about how students ""learn by touch"" as well as our understanding of the interplay between conceptual understanding and representational competence.

The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The research will first refine the CEMS Algebra materials and then document the feasibility of their implementation and the effects on student learning. The project takes a holistic approach by incorporating materials for teaching, professional development, and the study of teaching practice. The work will expand theories of algebra learning to include both conceptual and procedural learning. It will include detailed analysis about fidelity of implementation to understand how instructional differences influence students' knowledge. The first phase of the study (refining the materials) includes implementation in classrooms, teacher professional development, collection of lesson videos, and the development of student assessments for each unit. The second phase of the study compares the effects of the treatment to the business-as-usual with one district. The teachers from year 1 will serve as the treatment group in year 2 and a comparison group of teachers will be selected.

The PES are central to how chemists think about the structure and dynamics of molecular systems, in terms of minima and asymptotes connected by paths across landscapes or over energetic barriers.  The potential energy surfaces that Dawes and his coworkers create are used to study molecular dynamics and spectroscopy data that is relevant to many chemical processes including atmospheric chemistry, astrochemistry, and combustion.   A major thrust of the project is to develop a user-friendly, freely-distributed software package to support and enable members of a wider community, both experimentalists and theorists, to create their own potential energy surfaces to study a large variety of different systems. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop user-friendly software that acts as a bridge between codes that perform electronic structure calculations and those that compute the dynamics of interest.  The idea is to represent the electronic structure data with such high-fidelity that the computed dynamics directly reflect the underlying level of electronic structure calculations. (The fit only serves to render affordable the millions of potential evaluations required by dynamics codes). Very high fitting accuracy is required in order to assess the performance of subtly different methods or the importance of small correction terms. Previous work by Professor Dawes has resulted in suitably accurate interpolative methods known as interpolating moving least squares (IMLS). The automated fitting methods that were developed have reduced the bottleneck of PES generation and produced a stockpile of spectroscopically accurate PES. The current plan is to develop a generalized, extendable software distribution that others in the community can use to generate and fit their own PES.  The particular focus of this project is on processes involving several coupled PES. This involves systematic studies of systems which include various non-adiabatic interactions between electronic states such as conical intersections, Renner-Teller interactions, and spin-orbit coupling.  Accurate treatment of these effects in real applications represents the frontier of theoretical dynamics."

It's comparable to a car that only runs in the highest gear: ineffective, inflexible, and inefficient. Vast amounts of energy are wasted while making people too cold or hot in their offices. Based on a study conducted by Pacific Northwest National Labs there is a potential for 16% energy savings through incorporation of high resolution real-time occupancy data in building automation systems that control heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equating to roughly $2.7 billion annually. A survey conducted by Center for Built Environment at UC Berkeley showed that merely 11% of buildings fulfill standards for thermal comfort, and 26% meet air quality requirements, severely impairing occupant satisfaction and productivity. The small array of occupancy sensing products currently on the market are cumbersome, too costly, and tend to focus on narrow aspects of building operation. As a result they've achieved adoption of less than 1% of the total nonresidential real estate market. This I-Corps team is  working on a passive sensing system to address this industry-wide blind spot with a cost-effective and easy to deploy system in order to increase building energy efficiency and improve occupant comfort.<br/><br/>This team is working on a distributed sensing solution that will enable building HVAC control systems to respond to and anticipate building occupancy. The complete initial version of the system will include machine learning and computer vision algorithms embedded in the small fully wireless sensors processing data from a low-cost RGB camera and passive infrared sensor that will be able to detect both stationary and moving people across a coverage area of approximately 600 square feet in an open space. By the end of the program the team intends to have completed a software prototype for the image processing portion capable of delivering real-time occupancy counting and prediction using sample building image streams. More importantly, the team plans to have validated the demand in the market for the proposed product through the interviews, investigated the potential privacy concerns from prospective clients, explored value propositions outside of energy efficiency and comfort from advanced occupancy data, and identified the types of real estate clients that we should focus on. The proposed product has the potential to greatly reduce building energy consumption and improve occupant comfort throughout the US, and more broadly make the built environment far more responsive and data-driven. The team's interviews over the course of I-Corps program will be vital in shaping the business model to bring this application of computer vision and machine learning research and development to market."

The overall strategy is to locate probing sensors in or near the high-field regions where these emissions are primarily generated.

The primary advantage the field measurements have over others are 1) the proximity of the detection sites to the radiation sources to be studied (thundercloud charge centers and lightning leaders); and 2) the high time resolution and throughput capabilities of the detectors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The selected field sites (an urban tower in Canada, a region of very low altitude storms in Japan, and a very high altitude site in Mexico) represent the three situations in which it is at least feasible that downward TGFs might produce high enough radiation fields at the ground to represent a public safety issue (upward TGFs seen from space produce dangerous levels of radioactivity within thunderclouds at 10--15~km altitudes). Thus this program should allay (or justify) any concern about radiation at ground level nearly comprehensively.

Traditional surgical treatments for cartilage damage are not able to provide patients with long-term effective outcomes. This means that subsequent more aggressive surgeries will be required following the original treatment. More recently, there has been a paradigm shift to treat defects with an osteochondral allograft ? a plug of cartilage and bone tissue that is donated by a fresh cadaver. This technique is exciting because, once the graft is healed, it has the ability to restore the patient's cartilage structure and provide mechanical stability. Although this procedure has high success compared to alternative treatments, there are several limitations. One is occasional clinical failures where the osteochondral allograft does not heal properly in the bone region. The other is the limited supply of the grafts from tissue banks due to their short shelf-life. To improve the success and supply of these grafts, this I-Corps team aims to implement a cleansing technology to enhance bone repair and to increase shelf-life. Ultimately, these improvements will improve patient quality of life by improving graft integration and increasing patient access to the procedure. Additionally, tissue banks will be able to extend their supply through increased shelf-life, leading to increased revenue.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team is developing a bioinert cleansing procedure that will allow for the removal of biological inhibitors from osteochondral allografts without causing damage to the cartilage. This technology builds upon current donor tissue bank procedures and can be added to the current storage process, prior to graft distribution to hospitals. The team plans to conduct customer interviews with orthopaedic surgeons, allograft tissue banks, patients, and other stakeholders throughout the I-Corps program. During the I-Corps program, the team will assess commercial viability. If this is demonstrated, the next steps of development will further demonstrate technology performance and move forward with a commercialization plan. Throughout the development phases, the team will continue to obtain feedback from end-users and customers to validate that the technology meets the market need and demonstrates commercial viability."

Understanding the mechanism that has driven (and continues to drive) this amazing diversity is important, not only for science, but also for life itself. Knowledge of the history of life affects our way of thinking, our culture, and our society. Only recently, scientists have finally begun to understand how new body structures (novel structures) emerge during evolution. This project uses a core example of this novelty to explore a century-long question; where did the insect wing come from? Acquisition of wings has allowed the tremendously successful expansion of insects over the globe. However, the origin of insect wings remains a mystery and is regarded as a chief conundrum in biology. Through molecular and developmental analyses, wing-related tissues will be identified from a wide set of insects and other arthropods, which will allow for a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of insect wings. Gaining a comprehensive view of insect wing evolution will in turn advance our knowledge of the developmental basis underlying the development of new structures in general. The research will also further establish several organisms as alternative models for further genetic studies. In addition, this project will enhance undergraduate science education through establishing an infrastructure for student-oriented crowdsourcing efforts allowing researchers and students to publicly share the results of their gene disruption analyses and thus facilitate collaboration opportunities.<br/><br/>Over a century of debates and observations have culminated into two prominent hypotheses on the insect wing origin. One hypothesis, termed the paranotal hypothesis, connects the origin to the lateral extension of the dorsal thorax, the paranotal lobe. The second hypothesis, the exite hypothesis, connects the origin to the proximal leg segments and the branches (exites) stemming from these segments. Despite accumulating efforts to unveil the origin of insect wings, neither hypothesis has been able to surpass the other. A previous analysis in the Tomoyasu laboratory using Tribolium beetles has led to a combinational wing origin hypothesis, which states that insect wings have a dual origin, and that the merger of two unrelated tissues has been a key step in developing this morphologically novel structure during evolution. Further evidence for this hypothesis will be explored via (i) elucidating how the two tissues merge to form a complete wing structure in Tribolium, and (ii) identifying wing (serial) homologs from three additional species (a diving beetle, a cockroach, and a crustacean) to gain support of the hypothesis from a wider taxonomic breadth. RNA interference and expression analyses, along with CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing techniques, will be used to identify and follow the development of wing-related tissues in these organisms. The morphological comparison of the identified wing (serial) homologs in these organisms with those of Tribolium, as well as with the proposed wing origins will allow for the construction of a more complete history of the evolution of insect wings."

This algorithm will be based on a computational model of experimentally measured properties of Object Motion Sensitive (OMS) cells in the vertebrate retina, which solve a similar problem. From the known computational properties of the retina, it is expected that the algorithm will be robust under difficult tasks in motion tracking, including object occlusion, multiple moving objects, varying scene statistics, substantial background motion, and optic flow. From a biological perspective, the developed computational model will give insight to how the retina encodes moving objects. From an engineering perspective, the resultant computational algorithm will be applicable to machine vision from a moving platform, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance and reconnaissance applications, as well as, smart sensor design and neuromorphic systems.  <br/><br/>Despite many advances in motion analysis methods, techniques based on moving observations are still in a preliminary stage when compared to static observations, as far as reliability, efficiency, robustness, and runtime are concerned in real world scenarios. At other hand, our biological visual system is capable of performing similar motion computations reliably in the presence of constant eye movements. Recently, it was discovered that segmentation of moving objects, and rejection of background motion, begins in the retina. A subset of retinal ganglion cells responds to differential motion between the receptive field center and surround, as produced by an object moving over the background, but are strongly suppressed by global image motion, as produced by the observer's head or eye movements. This selectivity for differential motion is independent of direction and the spatial pattern of the object, enabling our visual system to find the boundaries of the moving objects, segregate multiple moving objects, and also anticipate the direction of motion. The retina performs these tasks simultaneously, in real-time, and with high accuracy using a network of only five basic cell types. These properties, along with the experimental accessibility of the retina, makes this neural circuit an ideal working biological system to serve as the design for an object-tracking algorithm. This project will develop a unique motion analysis algorithm for mobile observers based on recent findings of retina's motion computations and circuitry, and demonstrate its performance in a variety of realistic scenarios, which includes lateral observer motion, optic flow, dynamic scenes, and other objects that occlude the moving object."

Natural cements commonly precipitate along fault zones; these cements can dramatically inhibit fluid flow across a fault. However, determining the distribution of fault zone cements is difficult. As a result, fault-zone cementation is typically not accounted for in estimates of the impact of faults on fluid flow. This study aims to take advantage of unique electrical properties of natural cements to characterize the three-dimensional spatial distribution of cement for an exceptionally well-exposed fault zone. Then, the hypothesis that the degree and continuity of fault-zone cementation is a key control on fluid flow will be tested by drawing water from wells adjacent to the fault. The results of this project can be applied to better understand contaminant transport in faulted aquifers, the characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, and induced seismicity associated with wastewater injection. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved with all stages of the project, which will enhance education for underrepresented minorities at New Mexico Tech (NMT), a Hispanic-serving institution with a focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In addition, the geophysical equipment and groundwater wells used in this project will be long-lasting teaching resources both for NMT and for summer field courses sponsored by other universities.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to characterize field-scale permeability across a fault and link the hydrogeologic behavior of the fault to spatial variations in the degree of fault-zone cementation. The central hypotheses are: 1) there are more pronounced variations in the degree of cementation down-dip than along the strike of the fault because the up/down-section variations in grain size are larger than those along strike, and 2) extensive cementation does not reduce cross-fault permeability at the field-scale (i.e. the de facto hypothesis for hydrogeologic models that neglect the potential effects of fault-zone cementation). The proposed project comprises: 1) characterizing the degree and extent of cementation along the surface exposure of the fault; 2) collecting resistivity and chargeability data in transects across the fault, deriving empirical relationships between the degree of fault-zone cementation and normalized chargeability for shallow portions of the fault, and using those relationships to map the estimated degree of cementation for deeper portions of the fault; 3) coring the fault at depth to confirm the degree of cementation; and 4) conducting well tests to determine permeability across the fault in both strongly- and weakly-cemented sections. The study will generate geologically based geophysical observations, providing a unique 3D map of cementation patterns from the land surface to ~30 m depth, in transects covering >700 m along the strike of the Loma Blanca fault. Interpreting well tests across the fault in the context provided by the geologic and geophysical observations will allow for the development of a holistic view of fault-zone permeability, improving predictive models of the hydrogeologic impacts of faults.<br/>"

Because the cells must work together, they are electrically connected to one another to synchronize beating. It might have been expected that the strength and speed of contraction would be the same in neighboring cells. However, when cells are separate, their mechanical behavior is surprisingly different. It is not clear how these cells, being so different mechanically, still work together to produce efficient pumping. In this project, cell-to-cell mechanical variation will be measured in small samples of heart tissue. From this information, an accurate computer model of heart tissue can be created. The model will help explain how cell-to-cell variation impacts overall tissue function. Finally, the predictions made by the model will be tested in engineered heart tissues, which allow the amount of cell variability to be adjusted and studied. This work is significant because cell variability tends to increase with aging and in certain diseases. A clearer understanding of how variation contributes to normal and abnormal heart function could ultimately inspire effective treatments for cardiac disorders that are currently incurable. <br/><br/>New data suggest that adjacent cells from healthy heart tissue display substantial mechanical differences. How this 'microscale heterogeneity' affects the mechanical function of bulk myocardium has never been studied, but has far-reaching implications. This project examines the impact of microscale heterogeneity by testing two hypotheses: (1) That it has an appreciable influence on myocardial contraction even in normal hearts, and (2) That increasing microscale heterogeneity beyond normal limits disrupts tissue function. After measuring the nature and scope of microscale heterogeneity, its effects on tissue mechanical behavior will be predicted using a novel multiscale computational model. This model is comprised of a biophysically detailed muscle contraction model embedded in a finite element mesh for simulation of three-dimensional tissue mechanics. The predictions produced by the model can be tested by genetically manipulating cellular heterogeneity in engineered myocardial tissue mimics and measuring their biomechanical characteristics. The aggregate behavior of a network of adjacent but functionally different muscle cells has the potential of displaying new and surprising emergent properties. If proven correct, these hypotheses would shift current opinion on the determinants of myocardial relaxation and tissue homeostasis while shedding light on disease mechanisms."

The two conferences are aimed at stimulating research that draws from research communities that focus on human mobility and animal movement ecology.  These two communities previously have not interacted extensively, so the conferences are expected to facilitate interactions across the research domains to enhance understanding of frameworks, approaches, and methods that are useful in studying varied complex, dynamic, spatiotemporal systems.  The conferences will provide opportunities to share latest research and advance knowledge about understanding spatial behaviors and integrating research opportunities between the two domains.  The conferences will stimulate research that ranges across a broad range of topics, including disease spread; social networks; information diffusion and its impacts on privacy and identity; knowledge transfer, and urban, social, and ecosystem dynamics.  They also will facilitate scientific collaboration among young, underrepresented researchers who may not ordinarily have such networking opportunities.<br/><br/>These conferences will bring together a unique blend of scholars from the human mobility community, such as transportation, urban science, sociology, and public health and those researchers associated with movement ecology, a nascent but growing research area in the ecological sciences.  The conferences will take place at a time when scientific communities are just beginning to focus on movement and interactions motivated by advances in location-aware technologies and high spatial resolution global datasets.  The first conference will focus on measuring and analyzing interactions among mobile entities.  The second conference will focus on analyzing mobility data in the geographic context.  The events will include a balanced mix of keynote addresses from top scholars in the fields, interdisciplinary research presentations to facilitate interactions amongst the diverse set of scientists, and breakout group activities to delve deeper into specific topical areas."

Scientifically, the research project will advance the engineering of biological macromolecules (DNA and proteins) for formation of materials with their structures controlled on the nanometer length scale. The team leader will recruit participants from groups commonly underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines including minority and female students. This international research training experience will provide participants with unique opportunities to enlarge their scientific networks and to experience first-hand the benefits of cultural mixing. The project is important and deserves NSF funding, because it will develop molecular tools as well as scientific personnel capable of advancing nanoscience goals critical to the electronics and medical fields. US participants will benefit from significant scientific and social interactions with foreign students and faculty on-site in Denmark. The project will produce significant outcomes including cutting-edge research results and impactful research training experiences for participating American students.

IRES funding complements the Danish investment by allowing US students to participate in research at Aarhus.<br/><br/>	The project's scientific focus will be on the development of self-assembling DNA nanostructures and on their application toward nanofabrication of electronic, photonic, and biomedical devices. The NCSU team has used DNA as a building material to implement molecular computers, and to organize proteins and metallic nanoparticles with molecular-scale precision, while the Aarhus team is expert in DNA-guided chemistry for programmed synthesis of very large organic molecules. Developing ways to control matter on the nanoscale by exploiting the same construction principles used by biology (i.e. molecular recognition) holds great promise for diverse nanofabrication and biomedical applications. Engineered supramolecular complexes comprised of DNA, polypeptides, and inorganic nanomaterials provide the right length scale, range of physicochemical interactions, and complexity of shapes for interfacing effectively with biological structures. As such, DNA nanotechnology represents a perfect approach for creating custom diagnostic and ?smart? therapeutic agents for medical applications. Likewise, these same principles and materials are ideal for developing bionanofabrication procedures to compete with lithography for generation of electronic devices and circuits. Pursuit of biomimetic materials science, including molecular engineering for bottom-up assembly of complex nanostructures with diverse chemical, biological, photonic, or electronic functions, requires highly interdisciplinary teams. This cross-disciplinary work will therefore provide opportunities for very broad-based educational experiences to the participants. The cross-pollination provided by IRES funded international travel will lead to molecular materials engineering advances which could impact many fields of science and technology through applications in low-power nanoelectronics, programmable nanochemistry, novel biosensors, and smart therapeutics for biomedicine."

The project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter to study the organization of biological membranes. The modeling efforts will develop new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations. The current understanding of how multi-component giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) respond to osmotic pressure differentials is incomplete, and experimental observations indicate that a non-linear model coupling membrane dynamics with 3D fluid flow is needed to fully explain the non-linearities of the system. Developing this theoretical framework and providing insight into the underlying physics is crucial for the understanding of how membranes undergo morphological transitions. These models will explain existing experiments and also predict membrane response to different osmotic loads and membrane compositions. Understanding this process is important for better experimental design of in vitro reconstituted systems such as vesicles and also cellular systems. The work is inherently interdisciplinary, using mathematics and physics in biological systems. Both fields will benefit from this approach to studying biological phenomena; the theory will be grounded in experiments and also make predictions to design future experiments. This research will be integrated into the teaching efforts of the PIs in developing new courses at the interface of engineering and biology. The PIs will continue their efforts in enhancing diversity in the UC system while pursuing the research program. <br/><br/>Biological membranes are inherently heterogeneous mixtures of lipids and proteins. A key characteristic of this heterogeneity is the coexistence of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. This coexistence is thought to be the key organizing principle for the formation of lipid rafts. Studying the formation and organization of the different phases in cellular system is experimentally challenging, given the complex nature of the cells. Giant unilamellar vesicles with controlled compositions, allow us to study lipid behavior in bilayer membranes and gain insight into phase behavior which is important for understanding cellular membranes. Although GUVs are used widely experimentally, our theoretical understanding of lipid phase separation remains rudimentary, since existing models focus on the line tension between preexisting domains and not on domain growth and swell-burst cycles, which are the features observed experimentally. The objectives of this project are to formulate quantitative models of isothermal phase separation and swell-burst cycle in multi-component GUVs and test model predictions experimentally. STUDY 1-DYNAMICS OF SOLUTE EFFLUX. We will use theory, simulations, and experiments to understand the factors that control pore radius, vesicle radius, and the lifetime of the pore. STUDY 2-PHASE SEPARATION IN OSMOTICALLY STRESSED VESICLES. Using a viscoelastic model of multi-component lipid membranes, we will investigate the role of governing energetics in domain growth versus true phase transitions. We will experimentally test the model predictions by tuning the osmotic pressure difference, lipid composition, and sample temperature. STUDY 3-COUPLING BETWEEN DOMAIN FORMATION AND SWELL-BURST CYCLES. In this study, we will develop the mathematical framework to model the complete dynamics of the oscillatory phase separation coupled with the swell-burst cycle observed in the preliminary experiments. This model will combine the dynamics of pore formation outlined in Study 1, with the domain growth model including membrane viscosity in Study 2. The significance of the proposed activities lies in its promise to not only elucidate the fundamental properties of mixtures of lipids reduced dimensional, bilayer configuration but also furnish design principles for designing synthetic protocellular compartments for applications spanning in vitro production of proteins, chemistry in confinement, and delivery of biomedically relevant cargo (e.g., enzymes, drugs, and imaging agents). Using a combination of theory, simulations and experiments, this work will be able to provide insight into the complexities of lipid membranes. The long-term impact of the proposed activities stems from the fact that the project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter. The modeling efforts outlined here will result in new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations."

The overall goal of this project is to dramatically expand our knowledge of the species diversity, distribution, ecological function, and organismal biology of Aigarchaeota and to establish a taxonomic classification for the entire group. More generally, this project aims to set a precedent for the investigation of poorly studied microbial biodiversity and integration of biodiversity research on microbes into a meaningful taxonomy.

In addition, this project will contribute to an educational outreach program that provides content knowledge to K-12 students and teachers throughout from Clark County School District, and provide high-school teachers the opportunity to participate in a workshop and field excursion to collect samples for microbial analysis.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on two major study sites, Great Boiling Spring in northwest Nevada, and springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, but also includes investigations of terrestrial and marine geothermal systems worldwide. The specific aims are: 1) To discover new Aigarchaeota taxa and erect a candidate taxonomic structure, 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from natural samples and mined from databases will be combined with single-cell genomic and metagenomic datasets; phylogenetics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics, and ecological niche modeling will be integrated to erect a candidate taxonomic structure; 2) To assess the function of Aigarchaeota, stable isotope labeling experiments, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, and metaproteomics will test explicit hypotheses about Aigarchaeota metabolism, providing a window into how Aigarchaeota organisms function in nature; and 3) To cultivate, isolate, and describe Aigarchaeota pure cultures, enrichment cultures will be established in the laboratory and used to try to isolate and describe axenic cultures by using both traditional and innovative approaches. The combination of large-scale data mining, phylogenetics, taxonomy, ecological niche modeling, and field and wet lab work described here spans all components of the Systematics and Biodiversity Sciences Cluster and aims to transform our knowledge of a major lineage of Archaea and provide insight into species- to domain-level evolution."

In order to improve predictions that enable us to anticipate and plan for future change in ice cover on seasonal to decadal time scales, we need to understand the processes driving the observed change. An area of particular interest is the temperature-driven mass balance of the ice cover. The mass balance is the balance between the amount of ice growth in the winter and the amount of melt in the summer. Mass balance is a key climate change indicator since it combines the impact of heating and cooling at the top and bottom of the ice. If there is net warming over time, then there will be thinning of the ice. Conversely, net cooling leads to thicker ice. The objective of our project is to contribute to the Arctic Observing Network by maintaining a network of autonomous ice mass balance (IMB) buoys, installed in the drift ice of the Arctic Ocean. The observations from these buoys enable us to explore what changes in sea ice thickness are taking place and how these changes occur, thereby improving our understanding of this complex and important component of the global environment. Broader Impacts include contributing to Dartmouth College?s Women in Science Program and an ?adopt a buoy? program for middle school students. <br/><br/>The primary objectives of our project are to: 1) procure and deploy a minimum of 5 IMB buoys per year, to  increase network coverage, and 2) process and archive the data from these buoys to ensure that they are fully, freely, openly, and immediately accessible to all researchers and interested users. A key to achieving the first objective is an advancement in buoy technology, creating a version of the IMB that costs less to produce, is easier to deploy, and is designed for deployment in the increasingly prevalent seasonal sea ice cover. We will continue to strategically deploy the IMBs in coordination with complementary atmospheric and oceanographic instruments to optimize the observations throughout the Arctic Ocean. We will also continue to build on our strong national and international collaborations, to maximize the extent of the IMB network across the Arctic Basin and to minimize the logistic costs associated with deployment. The end result will be an integrated atmosphere-ice-ocean observing array providing a comprehensive description of the response of the ice cover to atmospheric and oceanic forcing."

However, rigorous quantification of how life stores, processes and propagates information at the various levels of organization observed in biological systems has remained elusive. In this project the PIs will utilize recently developed information-theoretic tools from complex systems research, typically applied to artificial life systems, to assess how a real biological system manages distributed information to perform a collective computational task. This research will provide new applications of mathematical and computational tools for use by scientists and will provide important insights in issues of broader concern such as colony collapse disorder observed in honeybees. The results will be disseminated to the general public through a variety of media as part of the outreach efforts of the PI and Co-Is. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs focus on characterizing information storage, processing, and propagation in colonial decision making as a rigorous case-study for understanding the physics of collective computation in living systems. The aim is to address several outstanding questions in insect behavior, by applying a novel theoretical framework treating collective decision making as a computation to the problem of collective nest site choice by the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. To this end, the investigators will implement a novel synthesis of two levels of theoretical investigation, agent-based modeling and information-theoretic analysis of experimental and simulated data sets, with experimental manipulation to determine the mechanisms of information processing among individuals that lead to global, emergent computation in Temnothorax rugatulus colonies. With this novel framework, the PIs will address several important outstanding questions about the physics governing collective choice, including the role of negative feedback and under what conditions collective wins over individual rationality. The research will provide one of the first detailed studies expanding the wealth of knowledge on emergent computation in complex systems to the biological realm. This study will inform our understanding of fundamental aspects of biological computation that will provide new perspectives on the physics of living systems by illuminating how life stores, processes, and propagates information. Due to the ease of manipulation of individuals within eusocial-insect societies, the PIs will be able to probe the minimal set of individual-level features necessary for spontaneous distributed computation."

Researchers will also examine how educators and employers define critical workforce competencies, student and employee experiences with education/training and the transition from school to work, and types of cross-sector partnerships that bridge the gaps between higher education and STEM industries. The fields investigated include photonics, information technology, energy, and advanced manufacturing industries in four regions in the U.S. with high concentrations of STEM jobs -- Seattle, WA, Raleigh, NC, Houston, TX, and Denver, CO. The study will result in a comprehensive account of how educators in a sample of 2- and 4-year institutions as well as STEM-related industries think about and actively cultivate key 21st century competencies. It will provide empirical evidence of how and when students and employees attain transferrable skills that are critical for their success in school, life, and work.<br/><br/><br/>The research team will use a framework integrating field theory, cultural models theory, and systems dynamics to guide a mixed-methods study to investigate five research questions: (1) How do educators and employers define, value, and incorporate into instruction and workplace training the essential 21st century competencies of collaboration, problem solving, communication, and self-regulated learning?  (2) To what degree do students engage in these competencies in the classroom?  (3) How do students and employees define, value, and think they are learning about these skills?, (4) What is the nature of cross-sector relations between education and industry in each region? and (5) Which individual, organizational, and sectoral factors influence whether (a) these skills are cultivated in school and/or work, and (b) active learning techniques are utilized?  A concurrent mixed-methods design will involve collecting interview data from faculty and administrators (n=80) and business owners (n=80), classroom observation data from faculty (n=64), focus group data from students (n=80) and employees (n=80), and survey data from a larger sample of educators and employers (n=464). To study instructional practices, a new module focusing on 21st century competencies will be developed for the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP), and data will be analyzed using the ICAP (interactive, constructive, active, and passive modes of learning) framework. Data will be analyzed also using inductive content, social network, logistic and multiple regression, and causal network analytic techniques as appropriate to the dataset and research questions. The research team will hold one-day workshops for local stakeholders in each region, as well as a summative national conference, to present regional field data, provide training on how to integrate key 21st century competencies into existing curricula and workplace training programs, and to open new lines of communication between and among educators, employers, government, and other community members.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

These 'fungal endophytes' (endo, inside; phyte, plant) can be important in enhancing plant health under stressful conditions. However, the factors that shape the diverse communities of endophytes found in different plant species are not well understood. This project's overall goal is to integrate fungal endophytes into our understanding of tropical plant ecology, with a special focus on the relationships among leaf traits, plant productivity, and the ability of plants to defend against insects and pathogens that attack leaves.  Improving our understanding of fungal endophytes is important since they influence plant productivity and resistance to environmental stresses such as drought and disease, including for plants of economic importance. Results will facilitate use of endophytes in mitigating plant responses to a rapidly changing world, with potential applications in sustainable agriculture and forest management.  This project will also support the training of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research, including students of under-represented groups, provide mentored research experiences for K-12 teachers and for high school students, and contribute to public outreach.<br/><br/>In the context of tropical forests, where leaf traits and endophytes are highly diverse, this project will test the hypotheses that (1) endophyte communities in leaves vary in relation to leaf traits associated with growth vs. persistence strategies; (2) endophytes will influence leaf and plant functions; (3) contribution of endophytes to plant defense will vary as a function of leaf traits; and (4) understanding growth vs. persistence strategies of plants can be informed greatly by integration of these foliar symbionts. The research approach involves field observations and experiments as well as bioassays. A field experiment is planned where endophyte communities are manipulated in 12 focal species. Additionally, leaves from these same 12 species will be introduced to leaf cutter ants to test whether longer lifespan species are less attractive to leaf cutter ants, and whether this will be mediated by endophyte load. Furthermore, pathogens will be introduced to the 12 focal species to assay if damage will be lower in leaves with high endophyte loads."

Much research has shown that people, based on their social location, differentially experience exposure to environmental hazards. This research seeks to add to our understanding of who is affected, to what extent, and why some people may experience greater exposure to environmental harms than others. Furthermore, this research implements an intersectionality approach in the investigation of who is affected by environmental harms. <br/><br/>To answer these questions, this research will test for and identify the socioeconomic, ethnic/racial, and gender-based determinants of the spatial location and distribution of landfills in the United States. For this research project, the co-PI will create a novel dataset of all types of landfills (e.g., construction and demolition (C&D), industrial, municipal, disaster-generated) at the county level across the contiguous United States in conjunction with data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Census Bureau to answer research questions. These data will be used to test several hypotheses concerning whether the socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic status, or gender status of a community is a major predictor in the level of exposure to landfills.  The data will be analyzed using GIS mapping, OLS regression, and structural equation modeling to obtain a predictive model for the spatial location and distribution of landfills. Theoretically derived hypotheses will be tested by combining quantitative data and statistical analyses on the location of landfills with qualitative interviews of andomly selected households (N = 30-40 respondents) living near five randomly selected landfills. Interview data will provide novel insights on how residents living near landfills assess environmental risk, how they view landfills as hazards, and the decision-making processes underlying their views of environmental degradation and inequality.  Empirically, we seek to identify the factors that predict landfill location and distribution across the U.S., an important issue given that landfill distribution may reflect and reinforce differential access to privileges, resources, risks, and vulnerabilities. Theoretically, we aim to understand whether and how environmental inequality and risk are influenced by racial minority status, poverty and socioeconomic status, or gender status."

Doyle of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. Professor Doyle and her students develop new reagents and strategies for nucleophilic fluorination. Fluorine is an essential constituent of myriad drugs, agrochemicals and materials that are crucial to public healthcare and industry. However, the tools to selectively install fluorine into organic molecules are either limited or in some cases nonexistent. Specifically, current methods for nucleophilic fluorination often rely on harsh conditions with traditional reagents resulting in low reactivity, selectivity and/or tolerance to other functional groups. This research leads to the invention of new latent HF sources for catalysis, the design of general strategies that enable mild and selective C-F bond formation, and the preparation of valuable fluorine-containing synthons for chemical synthesis. These strategies are also adapted for the synthesis of radiolabeled small molecules for use in positron emission tomography (PET), an important diagnostic tool for imaging the brain. The students supported under this program receive training in research, writing, communication skills, and mentoring. Through various programs, Professor Doyle recruits and mentors students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. Professor Doyle organizes the Princeton University Student Invited Lecture Series;  she and her students participate in outreach activities to encourage early engagement in the sciences.<br/><br/>The key focus of this research is the development of new methods for nucleophilic C-F bond formation enabled by novel strategies for in situ generation of HF from abundant, stable fluoride reagents. These synthetic methods offer routes that are efficient, mild, selective, and environmentally benign, utilizing either organocatalysis or transition metal catalysis. Researchers in the Doyle group and in the greater chemical community are able to apply these methods to construct elusive and desirable compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. This research program also creates opportunities for growth and promotes the advancement of underrepresented groups in the sciences through participation in diversity research programs, women in science events, and outreach activities to children from underserved communities."

The widespread dissemination of high spatio-temporal  resolution  high-sensitivity  microscopy could impact multiple fields of science and engineering such as 3D biophysical and biomedical imaging of labeled biomolecules inside and outside of cells. The project will also stimulate cooperative relations with industry to transfer innovations into applications. The dissemination plan offers a pathway from proof of concept to commercial development. Partner biologists at the University of Colorado will help validate the new instrument. The project has identified commercialization pathways that include development through a startup company, partnering for manufacturing and distribution, and exploring licensing agreements. The project also integrates interdisciplinary education and outreach with research and development. It will provide training to young scientists and engineers with opportunities for interdisciplinary research in microscopy labs. The outcomes of the project will be widely disseminated in publications, via outreach to the general public and middle school students.<br/><br/>The system overcomes limitations of traditional optical confocal scanning techniques by providing higher resolution and faster imaging. The new capabilities are realized using minimally invasive fluorescence techniques. Because biologists are currently constrained by the limited spatial - temporal resolution, and/or depth penetration of existing optical microscopes, the applications of the proposed instrument are far-reaching, with use in tracking changes within multi cellular structures, as well as in monitoring interactions between molecules."

To assist in the optimization of this process, this I-Corps team has developed an Interactive Multimodal Data Platform for Bridging Strategic Planning & Thinking. It leverages spatially-aware representation of data and focuses on methodologies that minimize bias to promote comprehension and identification of relationships among contextually related data points. The platform enables a study of the ensuing landscape from multiple vantage points, thereby promoting contextual awareness, focus, and ultimately the analysis of the existing data and its synthesis to promote optimal visioning outcomes. Since its inception, the project has attracted attention from two large-scale customers seeking to optimize their organization and project structure with two additional projects currently pending. Based on these developments the team believes the platform may have a potential for a viable business model, with particular focus on professionals and organizations looking to optimize their workflows and jointly explore the data for planning and visioning purposes.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide insight into the platform's commercial potential as well as help identify key elements that have attracted customer attention.

By using cloud, clients no longer require to install and maintain their own infrastructure and can instead procure Virtual Machines (VMs) with specific configurations of CPU, memory, disk, and networking in the cloud. With the recent rise in demand for cloud services, it has become imperative to use the cloud resources efficiently to not only meet the demand, but also ensure scalability and cost efficiency. For instance, VMs can be potentially concentrated onto a smaller number of servers, and many of the unused servers can be turned off (to save energy) or utilized to increase the number of VMs that could be simultaneously supported by the system (to maximize throughput and reduce delay). A similar issue arises for assigning data flows between the servers to available paths in the network where the available bandwidth could be optimally utilized in order to improve congestion, delay, or energy saving.<br/><br/>This project pursues three main objectives:<br/><br/>(1) VM Scheduling: This project develops efficient low-complexity algorithms for VM packing, without explicit knowledge of the demand and without VM migrations, targeted for the dynamic setting in the cloud (i.e., VMs arrive/depart dynamically over time as opposed to being an static list). The technical approach is to extend packing to both space and time which is necessary for this dynamic setting.<br/><br/>(2) Flow Scheduling: The applications hosted in the cloud have certain bandwidth requirements. Providing the bandwidth guarantees requires careful placement of data flows on available paths within the architecture. This project will study high-performance low-complexity algorithms for flow scheduling to balance the load and minimize the cost (e.g., delay, congestion, energy), without splitting and without re-routing the flows in the network.<br/><br/>(3) Empirical Evaluation: To demonstrate the gains over the current datacenter heuristics, this project will test the algorithms on both synthesized and real cloud traffic traces, on various datacenter architectures, and under a wide range of workloads. The project will also use CloudLab both as a source for traces and as a platform for hosting experimental prototypes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the project for the research community naturally arise from the wide prevalence of cloud and datacenters in modern Internet services. In particular, the PI envisions his algorithms and understanding of resource management in the cloud to further the state of the art in this field. This project has the potential to impact the IT industry by improving the scalability and cost efficiency of the cloud network architecture and to impact the society by reducing the energy usage of data centers and improving the user?s quality of experience. Industry impact and tech-transfer will happen through the industrial affiliates program of Data Science Institute at Columbia University.

Paradoxically these successes<br/>highlighted the fact that sequence, structure and function are linked together in a more subtle<br/>and complex way than previously thought. Specifically, protein families with recognizable<br/>sequence homology and strictly conserved architecture can show a huge functional heterogeneity,<br/>as in the case of voltage-gated-like ion channels (VGLCs).  The project's goal is to define a coherent theoretical framework to analyse both<br/>ensembles of structures and sequences and apply it to the study of ion channel communications. <br/><br/>The project proposes to use the Blue Waters system to address this problem using a combination of  accurate free-energy<br/>MD calculations and statistical inference analysis of both trajectories and large multiple<br/>sequence alignment. The microscopic determinants of mechanical coupling will be identified<br/>with the set of residue-residue interactions that are conserved along evolution and are responsible<br/>for a specific, functionally oriented structural dynamics. The study will focus on two specific<br/>ion channels families gated by different stimuli: transient receptor potential channels and<br/>voltage gated cation channels.<br/><br/>The project, if successful, will bridge the gap in our understanding of molecular processes and neuronal responses, with the potential of significantly advancing large-scale initiatives like the BRAIN in the US and the HUMAN BRAIN in EU.  Additionally, the project provides opportunity to involve graduate and undergraduate students in a research<br/>activity lying at the interface between the fields of data analytics and bio-molecular physical<br/>chemistry. Given the increased relevance of Big Data approaches to drug discovery and the<br/>emergence of precision medicine, the skillset and expertise acquired are expected to match<br/>the future needs of industry and academia. Furthermore, student recruitment in the project will take advantage of two<br/>initiatives. The first is a Professional Masters in Bioinformatics, where the PI is involved in<br/>all organizational aspects, from the steering committee to the design of Structural Bioinformatics<br/>classes. The second is the MARC U-STAR program designed to mentor underrepresented groups<br/>in research, providing financial assistance to prepare students for competitive graduate programs."

In particular, it will allow us to understand what classes of functions can be efficiently minimized, and what computational resources are needed to do so. If successful, this will significantly advance our understanding in all these key areas, produce new practical algorithmic methodologies, as well as build new connections with other fields, including quantum information theory, statistical physics, extremal graph theory and more.<br/><br/>This collaborative grant will foster new interactions between intellectual communities that have had relatively little interaction so far, and the PIs will organize workshops, courses, and other events that bring these communities together.

Despite considerable recent progress, understanding SoS?s performance seems to be out-of-reach for most current techniques. Significant progress in this area requires the synthesis of ideas and techniques from different domains, including theoretical computer science, optimization, algebraic geometry, quantum information theory and machine learning. The research plans include both theory-building and problem-solving aspects, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a complete understanding of the SoS method and related proof systems, as well as their algorithmic implications.<br/><br/>Research efforts will be directed along several thrusts: Unique Games and related problems (Small Set Expansion, Max Cut, Sparsest Cut), analysis of average-case problems (e.g., Planted Clique), applications to Machine Learning (sparse PCA, dictionary learning), algorithmic speedups of SoS, and connections to math and physics (e.g., quantum entanglement, p-spin glasses, extremal graph theory and algebraic geometry). While the main focus is on theoretical aspects, this project is also concerned with effective computational methods, and the outcomes may yield novel practical techniques for machine learning and optimization.<br/><br/>Other key features of this proposal include its strong integration with curriculum development, undergraduate research projects, and training the next wave of graduate students and postdocs and equipping them with the necessary tools to work across these areas."

This integrated microfluidic platform is important due to the direct impact on cancer patients and supporting infrastructure resulting from bringing this game-changing microfluidic device to market. Patient diagnosis and monitoring would become simpler, cheaper, faster, and more convenient. Moreover, the usage of this microfluidic platform is not limited to cancer diagnosis, but extends to any disease or condition measured via changes in cellular physical properties in a sample of biological fluid. The project will result in an optimized, integrated cell separator and enrichment prototype microfluidic device. The team will demonstrate its utility with clinically relevant levels of CTCs in whole blood to determine its feasibility for improved cancer diagnosis and monitoring. This integrated microfluidic device has the following unique features: (a) label-free cell separation, enrichment, and release, (b) clinical scale sample volumes and single pass through device to achieve complete cell isolation and enrichment (100% target capture) in approximately 20 minutes, and (c) device is amenable to mass production. When compared to the leading competing methods for CTC isolation and purification from whole blood in this market space, these features provide the following advantages: (a) simpler operation, (b) quicker, more reliable test results, and (c) lower cost per test and small form factor towards a potentially portable system for use in various point-of-care applications or resource limited settings.   <br/><br/>The main technology gaps to be addressed during the project are associated with optimizing the microfluidic device to achieve the rigorous performance levels required for CTC analysis (isolate and enrich 5 CTCs/7.5mL whole blood for downstream detection). These gaps will be bridged by having multiple integrated microfluidic devices working simultaneously in parallel and improving the sensitivity of the device to sufficiently separate and capture cells of similar size. In addition, personnel involved in this project, especially undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-docs, will gain innovation and technology translation experiences. They will become well versed in microfluidic cell sorting, enrichment, chip design, manufacturing, and the needs of primary end-users in multiple business spaces around the world.

As critical as self-efficacy is in the process of developing one?s interests, making career choices, and preparing for career entry, it is not clear how lower levels of these skills may limit one?s commitment to, ability to enact, and  self-efficacy about engaging in  the chosen career.  The research will provide valuable insights for students and career development practitioners on tactical measures for successful careers in STEM fields. The knowledge gained by understanding the interplay of the sophistication of career skill level and career development could alter the design of interventions to recruit and retain underrepresented persons throughout the STEM pipeline. <br/><br/>The researchers will use a mixed methods longitudinal design to investigate three questions: (1) What is the relationship among STEM career development measures, basic career skills, and social class and developmental complexity? (2) How do these variables change over time in both STEM persisters and non-persisters? and (3) How do these variables explain persistence among African American and women STEM majors? The sample will include a stratified, proportionally representative sample of 400 STEM majors. In addition to the primary variables of interest (career-related problem solving, decision-making, goal setting, and managing goal pursuit), STEM career development, professional identity, social class, and developmental complexity will be studied. Collecting data on grade-point average, changes in majors, internships, employment/graduate student interviewing, and progress toward career goals will provide the opportunity for examining the link between the previous variables and more traditional measures of success and persistence. They will use structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the relationship between and among the variables and growth curve modeling and profile analysis to provide additional data regarding the longitudinal change in the variables of interest. The research will result in a clearer understanding of the role of problem-solving, goal- setting, and planning skills in the development of a STEM vocational identity and persistence in STEM careers; the role of professional, racial/ethnic, and social class identities on commitment and retention in STEM majors; and the role of cognitive complexity in facilitating STEM career development, commitment, and retention. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

The initial invasion of a novel pathogen into a susceptible host population can cause a disease outbreak resulting in high levels of mortality and declines in population size. When this happens, natural selection can occur on both the host and pathogen populations during the disease outbreak. This can result in evolutionary changes in the host's susceptibility and tolerance to infection by the pathogen. It can also change the pathogen's ability to damage the host (virulence). These changes can in turn determine whether the host population can persist and recover from the disease.  Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial in development of conservation strategies for threatened species. This project will examine these processes for the case of a fungal pathogen that causes the disease Chytridiomycosis in frogs and salamanders. This disease has had catastrophic effects on amphibians worldwide, with numerous species extinctions documented in recent decades and many more species at risk. The researchers will investigate the patterns of evolutionary change in both the pathogen and the host (mountain yellow-legged frogs), following the invasion of the disease into hundreds of high elevation lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. This project will contribute to the understanding of the role of infectious diseases, such as Chytridiomycosis, as agents of evolutionary change in natural populations. It will provide critical information to state and federal agencies. It will also train and educate numerous, undergraduates and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/>This research builds on data from a long-term study of the population dynamics of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana sierrae and Rana muscosa) in the complex landscape of the California Sierra Nevada, and the impacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), as it has invaded and spread through hundreds of frog populations. In most cases, invasion of Bd results in outbreaks of the disease Chytridiomycosis, rapid frog population declines, and local extinctions. In some cases however long-term persistence of frog populations occurs with Bd in an enzootic state in which the impact of the pathogen is greatly reduced. The research will make use of recent advances in molecular approaches, and the extensive dataset and archive of samples from the R. sierrae/R. muscosa - Bd system, to investigate how populations of both host and pathogen change during the transition from pre-pathogen arrival, to disease outbreak, to enzootic disease, to potential recovery of the pre-disease host population abundances. This dataset will be used to investigate the genetic basis for differences in host resistance/tolerance and pathogen virulence. Cutting-edge genomic analysis of existing swab samples will be combined with continued surveys of field populations to identify new disease outbreaks and describe the transition from outbreak to enzootic state, collection of Bd cultures and frog mucosal samples from field populations, and laboratory experiments on Bd virulence and frog"

The focus of the partnership is to recruit annually a cohort of thirty ethnically and racially diverse high school students from the partnering school districts for immersion in a STEM intensive PBL four-week ""STEM Summer Academy"" hosted by Tuskegee University. The Academy is designed to provide 30 rising 10th and 11th grade students annually (90 over the life of the three-year grant) with far-reaching technological experiences through the exciting exploration of aerial drones under a PBL framework. Students in each cohort will form a diverse group in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and residing in urban or rural areas. The key questions being addressed are: (1) What coherent sets of experiences effectively and efficiently support student competency (e.g., knowledge, skills), motivation and persistence for productive participation in the STEM-related workforce of today or in the future? (2) What roles might business and industry workforce members play in motivating students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for careers in the STEM-related workforce? and (3) Given the shifting demographics reflected in our current classrooms and in our country what are effective and productive ways to ensure broadening participation by engaging diverse underrepresented populations in STEM programs and careers?<br/><br/>The goals of this project have been developed in collaboration with officials from the partner school districts, faculty at Tuskegee University and Auburn University and representatives from the Alabama State Department of Education.

This I-Corps team's goal is to improve arm and hand function following neurological disorders that affect the motor system, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). This I-Corps team has developed a new device, MOTION-REACH, that provides automated and high-intensity arm motor training based on continuous accurate measurements of hand path and arm/trunk kinematics acquired from a 3D camera. This allows for objective assessment of reaching performance, minimization of compensatory movements, and adaptive training. Adaptive training with MOTION-REACH is intuitive and can be performed by patients alone or in a semi-supervised clinical environment. MOTION-REACH also provides fast, high-precision, and validated assessments. Session-by-session reports and overall reports for the patient, the therapist, and the health insurance provider are generated and saved on a database in the cloud.<br/><br/>The MOTION-REACH device will expand therapist time availability because the device can be used by an unsupervised patient and does not require 1-to-1 supervision by the therapist, as it automatically monitors and prompts patients to perform movements correctly. Customer segments will include hospital-based and private physical therapy clinics. The device can be sold into the private patient marketplace, to be used in-home by private-pay patients under the remote guidance of a physical therapist.  The value proposition for the therapist derives from the ability to have patients performing highly effective therapeutic exercises without direct therapist supervision. The value proposition for the patient and the patient's medical insurance provider is that optimal and sustainable improvement is achieved in fewer therapy sessions than with traditional stroke recovery and other therapy techniques. This team's long-term goal is to develop personalized neurorehabilitation, similar to the successful drug dosing control in clinical pharmacology."

These species interactions are called mutualisms, and they are thought to maintain much of the world's biodiversity. Mutualisms are also the basis for important ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pollination, and nutrient cycling. But what happens when an invasive species displaces one of the species partners in a mutualism? That is the question this project will address in the savannas of Kenya, where an invasive ant species is displacing the native ants that live on acacia trees. Native ants aggressively defend trees by attacking elephants and other herbivores that eat trees; in exchange, trees provide food (sugary nectar) and shelter (swollen thorns) for the ants. In contrast, an invasive species, big-headed ants, kill native ants but do not defend trees. Without their native bodyguards, trees are being eaten and killed by elephants more frequently. This project will assess the rate and extent of tree loss associated with the big-headed ant species invasion. Because many species of wild herbivores, including endangered black rhinos, rely on trees in one way or another, this project also aims to understand how tree loss affects habitat for wildlife. This research provides a unique opportunity to assess the domino effects of a critical species mutualism breakdown in a landscape with an abundance of elephants, giraffes, and other iconic species of large mammals. <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that the cascading effects of the invasive ant species P. megacephala on the foundational mutualism between Acacia drepanolobium and native ants are context-dependent. In savannas invaded by P. megacephala, elephants are expected to reduce tree cover, thereby lowering soil and plant nitrogen (N) and negatively affecting forage and habitat quality for wildlife (since A. drepanolobium is an N-fixer). In contrast, where elephants are absent, P. megacephala invasion should accelerate tree growth, as P. megacephala does not induce nectar production and thus may reduce metabolic costs to host plants. Over the long-term, this mutualism breakdown is predicted to lead to higher tree cover and soil N in invaded areas. This project will (1) quantify the effects of native versus invasive ants on growth, N-fixation, reproduction and biomass of trees in the presence and absence of wild herbivores, especially elephants; (2) use demographic models to project tree population growth rates; (3) use remote sensing to assess the rate of spread of the P. megacephala invasion in both wildlife-present and wildlife-extirpated areas; and (4) assess the effects of P. megacephala invasion on availability of soil and plant nutrients and resulting habitat use by wild herbivores."

Research on species distribution has primarily focused on modern climate variation and species distributions. In this project, a novel combination of paleontological and modern ecological data will be used to examine how past climate patterns and competition among mammals have contributed to current primate biodiversity. As habitat loss and fragmentation are occurring worldwide, research investigating the factors determining primate biodiversity has implications for conservation management and maintaining the integrity of tropical forest ecosystems. Obtaining a better understanding of how primate distributions change through time and in response to changing environments will inform models for predicting shifts in primate ranges and community structure for future climates and habitat changes. The project will include the development of a database and web-based science education resources, and training of students from traditionally under-represented populations in the STEM fields. Students will gain important skills in data management and analyses that can subsequently be used in a wide variety of future career paths.  <br/><br/>The project seeks to examine primate community phylogenetic and trait structure across space and through time with abiotic and biotic factors suggested to cause the changing distributions and adaptations of primate species. The project is unique because fossil species locations and traits will be integrated with extant community data for macro-ecological and evolutionary analyses. Some of the questions addressed will be: Do communities found in similar environments, but on different continents, converge on the same structures? Do climate patterns from the Miocene through the present influence primate community structure? Do the presence and diversity of non-primate mammals that are potential primate competitors impact primate community structure? Are trait and phylogenetic structures of fossil primate communities predicted by climatic characteristics? The research proposed in this project will address topics that are central to understanding the modern and past distribution and coexistence of primates and other mammals. Using a community-level approach is essential for understanding how species interact to impact the evolution of each other's behavior, ecology, and morphology. Obtaining a better understanding of how primate communities change through time and in response to changing environments will inform models for predicting future shifts in primate distributions and community structure related to climate and habitat change."

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.<br/><br/>The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change."

With support from the National Science Foundation, Fielding Graduate University, in partnership with the Society of STEM Women of Color, Inc., proposes to enhance and implement the STEM Women of Color Conclave as a Broadening Participation Workshop series that will facilitate the preparation of a cadre of its participants for academic leadership roles. GPRA Strategic Management, Inc. (GPRASMi) will serve as the collaborative organizational partner in implementing the proposed Conclave Workshops. This effort will foster a strategic collaboration and provide access to formal postgraduate training in leadership studies. The overall goal of this effort is to increase the representation of STEM women of color in academic leadership positions by enhancing the quality of the leadership development experience. The proposed Conclave Workshops will heighten the profile of STEM women faculty of color who, in turn, will constitute a powerful knowledge network for broadening participation through effective academic leadership. As a long-term outcome, the proposed leadership development experience for women of color is likely to yield a cadre of academic leaders with the acumen needed to address the shifting demands of higher education, and the cultural sensitivity to yield academic success and better STEM career outcomes, particularly among underrepresented minorities.  As such, the proposed Workshops will extend beyond the leadership capacity of its participants to the thousands of underrepresented minority students with whom they will interact.<br/><br/>The proposed project will enhance the leadership development experience for women of color who provide the kind of academic and psychosocial support for underrepresented minority students that leads to better STEM learning outcomes by: 1) convening broadening participation workshops focused on leadership development for STEM women of color; and 2) providing access to opportunities to earn continuing education credits as credentials necessary for acquiring legitimacy in and contributing to STEM academic leadership. The specific objectives are: 1) to convene a two-day Broadening Participation Workshop: National Conclave for STEM Women of Color; and 2) to provide access to continuing education (CE) credits for Conclave participants. This project will contribute to redefining higher education leadership to meaningfully include an awareness of, affinity for, and sensitivity to the academic and psychosocial needs of underrepresented minority students, thereby broadening participation. Collectively, these efforts are expected to impact a network of thousands of STEM higher education reformers committed to diversifying STEM faculty, as well as a wider pool of faculty and academic administrators, from all disciplines, who are committed to recruiting and retaining STEM women faculty of color."

Network operators realize these goals by composing and configuring diverse network appliances such as routers, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and web proxies. Unfortunately, this process of managing networks is extremely challenging, error-prone, and entails significant manual effort and operational costs. Configuration and implementation errors could have significant consequences as it can degrade network performance, induce downtime for critical infrastructures, and cause violations of key security postures. Systematically identifying and diagnosing potential violations has been, and continues to be, a fundamental challenge. This project will develop a principled framework to check if a network setup correctly implements a given suite of policies and to help operators proactively and automatically diagnose and localize the sources of policy violations. <br/>				<br/>Checking policy violations is hard even for simple reachability properties (e.g., can A talk to B) in today's networks.  Furthermore, next-generation technologies such as software-defined networking and network functions virtualization are poised to enable richer dynamic policies (e.g., if a host generates too many connections, subject it to deeper inspection) and also introduce new sources of complexity (e.g., elastic scaling, software bugs). Existing approaches in network testing and verification have fundamental expressiveness and scalability challenges in tackling dynamic policies and stateful elements. To address these challenges, the research will include developing a model-based testing framework that will lead to fundamental advances in network semantics, modeling, testing, and diagnosis.  To this end, the project will design: (1) new formal semantics to express dynamic policies over stateful networks; (2) expressive-yet-efficient abstractions for modeling the behavior of advanced network functions; (3) techniques to synthesize models of network functions; (4) scalable symbolic execution algorithms to generate test cases; and (5) efficient diagnosis algorithms to validate tests and localize violations. 					<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research and education activities will develop testing tools and abstractions, which is a new capability that bolsters networking education, research, and practice. The project will inspire future educators and practitioners to apply systematic network testing as an integral part of their workflow to guarantee the security, performance, and availability our critical infrastructures. The project will develop new educational modules that will be integrated into the research with undergraduate and graduate-level classes and undergraduate capstone classes. The research and education efforts will engage undergraduates and underrepresented communities. The project will create unique opportunities for interdisciplinary training of the future workforce across the domains of networking, security, programming languages, and formal verification.  The project will also design novel security games and education modules for K-12 students and teachers to highlight the importance of network testing for securing our critical infrastructures. Finally, the project deliverables (code, models, and education modules) will be released under open-source licenses as enablers for other researchers and educators, and to help transition the ideas from research to practice."

Imagine if instead of interacting with a CAD or molecular model with a computer mouse, it was inexpensive enough that you could use the developed haptic device to grab the model within a 3D environment and pull on it to feel the strength of fasteners or molecular bonds. While these interactions can already be portrayed with desktop interfaces like Novint?s Falcon force feedback device, our technology could do this at a much lower price point and could also be used in large workspace applications like playing video games or exploring in VR a home living room.

This project relates to the technology area of ?Human Assistive Technologies and Bio-related Robotics? and the consumer electronics market segment. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies. This demand has been fueled by the renewed interest in virtual reality (VR) with the availability of inexpensive 3-dimentional (3D) head-mounted displays (HMDs). Current haptic interfaces are either too expensive and have limited workspaces or are too crude to portray force/torque interactions. The company hypothesizes that it can create an ungrounded haptic motion controller that can emulate force feedback at a price that will be viable for consumer virtual reality. This research will utilize tactile shear feedback within the handle of a game controller interface. Actuators within the controller will apply friction and shear forces to the user?s hand, which will in turn be driven based on simulated interaction forces from a VR physics engine. This will create an integrated haptic experience that will connect the user to the virtual environment."

Standard solutions first assume that the unknown object obeys a structured mathematical representation, and then develop optimization algorithms for recovering the parameters of the representation. Moreover, rigorous analysis reveals that several such algorithms are statistically optimal. However, despite these advances in statistical understanding, the role of computation is far less well understood; in many cases, even the best methods incur a computation time proportional to a high-degree polynomial in terms of the data size. Therefore, to reap the full benefits of these methods in applications involving massive data, new algorithmic approaches are necessary. This research project introduces new theory and computational tools for learning structured data representations in linear running time. <br/><br/><br/>The new algorithmic approaches are based on the intuition that challenging optimization problems encountered in data analysis can be circumvented if the answers are merely approximate, rather than exact. Establishing precise tradeoffs between statistical performance, approximation quality, and running time is a key focus. With this intuition, the project addresses three specific problems: (i) Reconstructing signals and images from nonlinear observations. (ii) Recovering graphs from partial observations, such as linear sketches or inter-node distance measurements. (iii) Estimating multidimensional probability distributions from random samples. Algorithms developed within the scope of the project impact applications ranging from medical imaging, computer network monitoring, social network analysis, and non-destructive evaluation (NDE).

The reaction of the magnetosphere to driving as well as the driving by the solar wind are more complex than commonly thought and than current models can capture or explain. This Investigation will perform a comprehensive statistical analysis to explore those complexities.  The data sets created and the findings of the analysis will be disseminated via a new ""Earth Index Collection"" webpage to be created. Tutorials, examples, and research suggestions will also be made available via the webpage.<br/><br/>This Investigation will take a systems-science approach, analyzing the reaction of the multiply measured magnetosphere to the full solar-wind data set. It will collect and create a large number of time-dependent indices, each one being a different measure of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The ""indices"" will be measures of the currents, plasmas, energetic particles, waves, morphology, and energy flow in the system. The collection of time-dependent indices will be put together to form a time-dependent ""Earth Index Collection"" of measurements. Canonical correlation analysis will be used to identify and explore correlation patterns between the multivariable Earth index collection and the multivariable solar-wind data set. For the primary mode of reaction of the Earth index collection to the solar wind, a time-dependent ""collective index"" will be identified and defined and the universal coupling function that drives that primary mode will be defined. Secondary global modes of the reaction of the Earth to the solar wind will be identified, cataloged, and investigated and the properties of the solar wind (the secondary coupling functions) that drive the secondary modes will be identified. Attempts will be made to connect the secondary coupling functions with physical mechanisms such as the viscous interaction, changes in the location of the dayside reconnection line, and changes in the morphology of the magnetosphere. By analysis of the secondary modes of reaction, the ""sectors"" of the Earth index collection will be identified and the indices that comprise each sector will be cataloged. Exploring suppression and confounding in the multivariable solar-wind data set as its variables correlate with the Earth measurements, causal correlations versus non-causal correlations will be identified. Finally, traditional data-analysis methods will be used to elucidate the sectors and the global modes of reaction of the magnetosphere to the solar wind."

This research will create knowledge with implications for utilities that find themselves serving transient, sometimes large populations (particularly those which arise suddenly). This knowledge will enable more resilient planning, policy, and technical design that can accommodate potential disaster migration and other extreme population growth as required.<br/><br/>This project will identify and explore changes in the organizational structure and processes of utilities in response to the European refugee influx, which has triggered an unprecedented flow of refugees to various European nations. This situation provides a unique opportunity to capture perishable data on the institutional impacts that sudden, disaster-triggered population increases may have on established water and sanitation utilities. This work will yield new insights into how normative and cultural/cognitive forces can influence the shape and function of public utilities. Data on both human and technological aspects of these phenomena will be collected, to include interviews, observations and visual documentation, to include decision makers in the water and sanitation utilities in the German cities of Munich, Berlin, and Leipzig. Even under normal conditions, data on these phenomena can be difficult to obtain. As such, immediate and focused efforts are needed to collect the organizational data for this study, and to situate these data within a holistic socio-technical context."

Other process industries (e.g., food processing) also have similar needs for heating and cooling, thus resulting in extensive use of different types of heat exchangers. Over time, the widespread use of the heat exchangers leads to their decline in their performance due to fouling and corrosion, as well as due to the inability to provide for their constant cooling. There is a lack of immediate solution to prevent these existing issues in the refineries, due to high operating and capital costs associated with the petrochemical and other process industries. Nanofluids Technology is a promising solution to combat these challenges by improving the energy efficiency (through enhancement of the material properties of the coolants) as well as mitigating issues due to fouling and corrosion. The proposed tasks in the I-Corps project will enable the market survey and identification of bottlenecks in these industries ? thus accelerating the anticipated development of this technology and by enabling more effective insertion and deployment of the Nanofluids Technology based on customer needs.<br/><br/>Nanofluids are capable of altering the thermo-fluidic properties of heat transfer fluids to facilitate better thermal management. This has applications in various industries, including: power generation, transportation (automotive, aerospace, etc.), chemical and food processing, life sciences (e.g., rapid thermal cycling for nucleic acid analyses), buildings, defense and homeland security, oil and gas exploration.  The I-Corps team will perform market surveys in the petro-chemical industry for targeted deployment of Nanofluids Technology with the goal of improving the performance of heat exchangers. The I-Corps team will identify the deficient aspects of Nanofluids Technology that need to be improved to be more responsive to the market needs and will leverage the inherent benefits of this technology. The Nanofluids Technology will be demonstrated for various types of heat exchangers to convince the potential customers of its efficacy. This technical demonstration will strengthen the technology requirements and will be guided by target metrics derived from the customer surveys.

In many cases, the possibility of organ transplantation is prevented because of the objection of the donor's family, especially when the deceased herself did not express her willingness for organ donation (OD) while alive. This project implements a broad and in-depth research program to understand behavioral and psychological mechanisms behind OD decisions. It aims to find ways to increase the percentage of organ donors and the support for policies that may increase ODs. For example, encouraging OD receivers to tell their story in the media (with identifying detail) may increase the support for OD. Likewise, providing statistical information about the average life expectancy may promote realistic thinking about death and may increase willingness to commit to OD. We believe that increasing the number of potential organ donors as well as the public awareness of this issue may help to save the lives of many that are waiting for organ transplants.<br/><br/>The planned research addresses three main objectives. (1) To learn about the role of the presentation of OD cases in affecting people's willingness to commit to OD (including the decision to donate the organs of a deceased relative).  (2) To examine individual differences in death anxiety (Fear of Personal Death - FPD) and in people's beliefs, to learn about their role in predicting people's decisions regarding OD issues. (3) To manipulate the factors situationally, using priming techniques (i.e., priming thoughts about religious issues, about just vs. unjust world; thoughts of tempting fate; manipulation or increasing the salience of different aspects of the FPD) to examine the influence of such manipulations on people's decisions regarding OD issues. Together, these research directions will help us to better understand the mechanisms behind OD decisions and describe how these decisions differ from other donation decisions."

The increased corrosiveness resulted in the release of heavy metals (e.g., lead and iron) into the water supply. This RAPID grant addresses a critical gap in our knowledge and offers a timely, yet unique opportunity to advance our fundamental understanding of bacterial communities that make up biofilms in the Flint potable water distribution systems.<br/><br/>Biofilm and amoebic hosts are an important habitat for pathogens and protect them from disinfectants such as chlorine. Individuals may be exposed to aerosolized Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Pseudomonas spp in contaminated water from shower heads, shower plumbing, and water heaters. Despite recognition that contaminated water exposure is an important risk factor for Legionellosis, there is currently limited information on bacterial populations that coexist with Legionella spp. within biofilm microbiomes. In this project, the PIs proposed research will characterize bacterial biofilm communities and their distribution within potable water distribution systems supplying Flint households. Using metagenomic analysis targeting 16S rDNA, the PIs hypothesize that biofilm bacterial populations may vary by household distance from water treatment sites as well as by physico-chemical characteristics of water collected concurrent with biofilm sampling. Currently, household sampling of potable water and biofilm swabs from household shower pipes and humidifiers are being analyzed using standard culture and molecular methods for the presence of Legionella spp. The aim of this study is to compare microbiome found in biofilm specimens with and without Legionella spp. The study will utilize quantitative PCR and DNA sequencing methods to identify bacterial pathogens biofilm microbiomes. The proposed project will provide novel characterization of bacterial species in biofilm microbiomes of Flint households. These data will be used to compare potable water chlorine levels among specimens with and without Legionella spp. Results from microbiome analysis will used to guide future environmental sampling and surveillance for Legionella and other bacterial pathogens. Moreover, available Legionella spp. isolated from case-patients in the epidemic of 2015 will be genetically compared with those identified among biofilm specimens in Flint households. The results of this work will help guide the development of important intervention strategies to reduce OPPP exposure and protect susceptible individuals from these potential pathogens."

By developing linked histories of reef climate and coral growth on the remote northern Great Barrier Reef, this research will illustrate how the region's climate has changed over the past 200+ years and how coral growth has varied in response. Corals in this region can survive for centuries, and a core from the top to the bottom of a long-lived coral colony reveals annual banding that documents the rate of coral growth over that time. The coral's skeletal chemistry tracks the environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, sedimentation) under which the coral grew. Because the corals grow at a rate of a centimeter or more each year, cores can be sampled at a scale of weeks to months to determine short-term (seasonal) as well as long-term (century) trends in growth and environment. The project takes advantage of cores already recovered from northern Australia, where temperature and salinity are closely tied to the state of the El Nio system. El Nio influences climate around the world. This research will help climate scientists understand how El Nio is changing as the world warms and whether recent strong El Nio events are unusual or within the range of natural behavior. By linking the climate record to a history of coral growth from the same core, this project will help coral ecologists to see the connections between climate variations and coral growth rates from seasonal to century time scales. The research includes collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS), which advises the Australian government on reef management and conservation. By spending a summer at AIMS, a graduate student will receive high-level experience in issues of coral health, growth, and conservation that are critical for managing reefs here in the US as well as abroad. Project participants will engage in interdisciplinary climate research at the University of Arizona, including climate model analysis, the global impacts of El Nio, and communicating their work to a broader audience through public presentations at Biosphere-2.  <br/><br/>The specific goals of this project include the following:<br/>- Use multicentury, subseasonal measurements of coral &#948;18O and Sr/Ca to define the natural variability of temperature and salinity in this region, and their relationship to regional climate; <br/>- Extract seasonally specific histories of El Nio and Australian monsoon rainfall to compare with other records and evaluate for long-term variability; <br/>- Compare geochemical histories with luminescent and growth band properties to evaluate agreement and sensitivity as proxies for environmental change; <br/>- Use the multivariate information from corals to assess relationships among environmental variations (SST, SSS, and sedimentation) and coral growth (extension, calcification); <br/>- Incorporate records into broader analyses of tropical variability, e.g. long-term variations and trends, large-scale patterns, multiproxy syntheses, and comparisons to GCM simulations. <br/><br/>This project represents a major advance in climate and coral studies. Despite the long history of coral paleoclimatology, this will be the first integration of geochemical and growth-band characteristics at a subseasonal, multicentury scale. Multiple paleoclimate proxies will yield broadly useful reconstructions of El Nio and monsoon rainfall and reveal how environmental changes influence coral growth. These results will be incorporated into large-scale syntheses to improve understanding of long-term tropical variability. All results will be publically shared with reef managers and other stakeholders, as part of the AIMS mission of science-based conservation, and presented in Arizona to the thousands of visitors that pass through the University of Arizona's Biosphere-2."

Corrosion will cost the US economy over $1 trillion in 2015. It is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion technologies to reduce this huge economic cost of corrosion. The most effective anticorrosion pigments in use today are based on heavy metal pigments, such as chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds. Environmental, health, and safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments. The proposed new product will not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection. The project is especially targeting replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures. Solving the poor processibility of environmentally friendly conductive polymers should enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. <br/><br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in using advanced knowledge and understanding of anticorrosion coatings. It is generally assumed that organic coatings act as barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface. But corrosion of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that relates to both cations and anions. The present proposal suggests developing an ion barrier anticorrosion coating system: conductive polymer nanoparticle pigmented epoxy primer with a topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore, provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal. This system will not use heavy metal anticorrosion pigments any more. If present proposed research succeeds, it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating provides corrosion protection to a metal substrate, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating, and lead to the next generation of anticorrosion coating."

The color and shape of feathers are of fundamental importance in bird courtship rituals, camouflage, and other social and ecological interactions. Feathers can evolve rapidly - populations of the same species often show striking differences in feather color and patterns. The mechanisms that are responsible for these differences, however, are poorly understood. Abolins-Abols investigates how and why feather color differs between individuals and populations. In this dissertation improvement project   Abolins-Abols will investigate the hormonal mechanisms that regulate the development of two rapidly evolving feather traits - head and tail color - across multiple populations of the Dark-eyed Junco, a small songbird that is a common visitor to feeders across the United States. This research  will increase our understanding of the evolution of bird color diversity, because head and tail feathers are hotspots for variation across songbirds. This project will also train undergraduate students and facilitate outreach to the general public using the newly founded bird banding station where Abolins-Abols will characterize color variation across a variety of migratory bird species. The affordability and simplicity of this study system make it a prime candidate for future research programs in development and evolution, especially at smaller institutions such as liberal arts colleges.<br/><br/>Some feather ornaments are used as honest signals, suggesting that their development is integrated with other phenotypic traits such as behavior. A candidate mechanism for this integration is hormones, which regulate both neural and peripheral processes. While hormones have been shown to mediate sex differences coloration, we do not yet understand the role of hormones in mediating individual differences and population divergence in feather color. Abolins-Abols proposes to investigate the genetic and hormonal mechanisms that mediate the development of two rapidly evolving social plumage ornaments - head and tail color in Dark-eyed Juncos - across populations of varying coloration. These honest feather ornaments have been shown to be related to individual differences in testosterone physiology, suggesting a causal link between hormones and feather color. To gain an explicit understanding of whether and how hormones regulate this variation, Abolins-Abols will analyze hormone receptor gene and protein expression in developing feathers in combination with experimental manipulations of testosterone and luteinizing hormone. By understanding the hormonal regulation of these ornaments we will gain insight into how these ornaments are linked to behavior as well as a better understanding of how hormones mediate the divergence of social feather ornaments."

In addition, Asian Americans exhibit significant socioeconomic diversity, making them ideal for answering larger theoretical questions on immigrant incorporation in the United States, as it is shaped by differences in national origin, residential concentration, and educational and labor market outcomes. This project will build a data resource for public release in June 2017 that will have widespread utility among scholars in social science disciplines, most notably in sociology, political science, and public policy, as well for journalists and bloggers versed in social science data and trends.  The survey of Asian Americans will provide important data for questions related to immigrant incorporation, attitudes on economic inequality and race-relations, and civic and political engagement. In addition to providing comparisons within the Asian American racial category, we will include cross-racial comparisons (to African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and non-Hispanic whites) using the same instrument and mode of interview. This project advances the mission of the National Science Foundation to promote the progress of science, particularly the social sciences, as well as to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. In particular, this project has relevance in terms of broader impacts as specified by Congress in 2010: Asian Americans have a disproportionately large number of high-skilled workers in STEM fields. Understanding their experiences, attitudes, opportunities, and barriers, will be critical to ensuring the economic competitiveness of the United States and the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce<br/><br/>This survey of Asian Americans will: 1) be contemporaneous with the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) and American National Election Study (ANES), 2) replicate key questions from those surveys, and 3) build on the pioneering efforts of past surveys of Asian Americans.  The project produces a dataset for public release in June 2017 through ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for<br/>Political and Social Research) that will have widespread utility among scholars in social science disciplines as well for journalists and bloggers versed in social science data and trends. The survey will provide data to address questions related to immigrant incorporation, attitudes on economic inequality and race-relations, and civic and political engagement. In addition to providing comparisons within the Asian American racial category (samples of approximately 400 adults each among major national origin groups), it will include cross-racial comparisons using the same instrument and mode of interview (approximately 400 adults each among whites, Latinos, and African Americans).<br/><br/>A growing number of studies focus on Asian Americans. However, existing surveys tend to be limited to a small number of national origin groups or to a relatively specific geographic area. More general studies such as the GSS and ANES do not have the requisite sample size or language support to accurately capture the experiences and attitudes of Asian Americans. The primary innovation of the 2016 National Asian American Survey is to replicate questions on important general surveys, specifically the GSS and the ANES, with a large sample of Asian Americans in a well-designed study. With this commitment to question replication, the 2016 National Asian American Survey will allow researchers, for the first time, to compare Asian Americans to the U.S. public on key social and political measures, and to make important comparisons within the racial group."

Biointerfaces on the one hand compartmentalize disparate biological components within a functional living module (e.g., a cell) and on the other hand facilitate integration. The appreciation of how interfaces determine biological functions and how interfaces must be considered in devising biomaterial alternatives to their living counterparts requires an interdisciplinary discourse, ranging over biomacromolecules and single cells to tissues and organs. The 2016 GRC seeks to seed this discourse, help generate a common language across disciplines, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. The constituency of the Biointerface Science GRC attendees is already multidisciplinary.

However, to fully understand how ""broken"" clocks cause negative effects, understanding how they promote optimal function under normal circumstances is necessary. The goal of this research is to understand how circadian clocks promote normal functioning of brain circuits important in complex behaviors like decision making, attention, and cognitive flexibility. A mouse model is used to investigate how normal or disrupted circadian rhythms regulate the size, shape, and function of neurons in the brain, and how these changes affect cognition. Advanced techniques in the measurement of brain chemistry, imaging, 3-dimensional reconstruction of neurons, and pharmacology is used to help understand how circadian clocks maintain normal function, and how disrupted clocks lead to negative outcomes. An integral component of this award engages rural and urban undergraduate students in outreach involving the Mobius Science Center and Children's Museum in Spokane, helping increase awareness of how biological clocks affect physiological function, from the simplest organisms, to our own brain.<br/><br/>Significant inroads have been made in understanding the cellular and molecular function of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock. However, the fundamental role of circadian rhythms in brain areas underlying complex behaviors, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), remains illusive. Using environmental circadian disruption as a tool, this research determines how circadian rhythms modulate normal PFC function at the behavioral, physiological, structural, and biochemical levels. This research builds upon our findings that circadian disruption impairs cognitive flexibility and causes atrophy of PFC neurons. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that circadian rhythms promote normal PFC function primarily through modulation of glutamatergic signaling, since glutamate is crucial for optimal PFC function. Circadian disruption effects on the PFC is determined by examining PFC mediated behaviors, and through the use of implantable biosensors to determine effects on extra-cellular PFC glutamate in real time. To establish a causal role for glutamate, pharmacological manipulation of PFC AMPA and NMDA signaling is undertaken. Confocal microscopy and 3-D reconstruction of PFC neurons is used to investigate circadian changes in neural morphology and dendritic spines, primary sites of excitatory signaling. Biochemical studies determine how normal and abnormal circadian rhythms drive membrane trafficking of glutamate receptors, providing another substrate on which circadian rhythms may act to modulate PFC function. The third and final experimental aim is to determine whether changes in a rhythmic hormone (corticosterone) mediates these effects, which would provide a mechanism by which normal and disrupted timing cues are relayed to extra-SCN brain regions."

Recent decades have witnessed an increase in television campaign ads that depict Latinos as ""illegal aliens"" and employ gritty, menacing images of Latinos. This trend of targeting Latinos is seemingly replacing an earlier period of negative campaign advertising that focused on mobilizing voters by tapping into their fears of African Americans. While much literature that explains the conditions under which these ads are effective, the theories are nearly exclusively built upon campaign ads that target African Americans. As the Latino community continues to grow in the United States it is increasingly important to explore whether these existing theoretical models hold true for negative campaign ads that target Latinos. This research examines the effects of negative campaign ads and racial priming on vote choice using a survey experiment that is conducted using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Elections Survey. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project employs a survey experiment to study the impact that racial appeals targeting Latinos have on voters' political opinions and vote choice. It aims to test the theory of racial priming by assessing whether this theory similarly predicts opinion and vote choice when the target of these political ads are Latinos rather than African Americans. The survey experiment will utilize a dual-wave panel administered through 2016 Cooperative Congressional Elections Survey (CCES) with a nationally representative sample. This dual-wave feature helps overcome contamination effects that may result from asking questions about race before the experimental manipulations. In the survey experiment respondents will be exposed to three campaign mailers for a fictitious congressional candidate. Exposure to one of the randomly assigned treatments is then followed up by a survey battery that asks respondents about their vote choice, candidate favorability, and support for restrictive social policies."

Significant loss of RBCs due to emergencies and/or combat injuries requires blood transfusion, a life-saving intervention. RBCs, however, can only be stored outside the body for 14 days and transfusion of stored RBCs has been linked to increased risks of sickness and death. Artificial RBCs that have the similar features with natural RBCs and an improved storage lifetime are expected to overcome the problems associated with natural RBCs. Furthermore, artificial RBCs can be utilized as drug delivery vehicles when specific drugs are incorporated, and thus provide novel therapeutic advances in drug delivery. Current methods used to generate artificial RBCs, however, fail to mimic either the shape or softness of natural RBCs or have limited oxygen delivery ability. Artificial RBCs-based drug delivery is also less studied. Here, we are planning to produce artificial RBCs using innovative nano/micro technologies that enable the recapitulation of key features of natural RBCs and development of artificial RBCs-based drug delivery system. <br/><br/>Artificial RBCs play a critical role in blood transfusion, which is a commonly life-saving intervention, especially for emergencies and combat injuries. This is particularly true considering the risks associated with allogeneic blood transfusion such as exposure to blood borne pathogens and inaccurate cross-matching for blood types. In addition, blood storage lesion has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in clinical trials, and thus has urged the research of alternative blood substitutes. Most developed artificial RBCs, however, have encountered shortcomings including tissue injuries, immune system suppression, and particularly the low hemoglobin encapsulation efficiency. Most importantly, all current artificial RBCs are used as oxygen carriers and do not have the ability to fulfill other key physiological functions of natural RBCs such as deformation-induced adenosine triphosphate release, which is known to be critically important in the regulation of  vascular tone. Here, by using innovative microfluidic approaches and tailor-designed amphiphilic block copolymers at the molecular and nanoscale, we aim to develop artificial RBCs that mimic the morphological and mechanical properties of natural RBCs and are capable of controlled release of adenosine triphosphate. <br/><br/>The research described in this proposal will provide innovative engineering strategies to produce artificial RBCs mimicking the morphological, mechanical, and biological functions of natural RBCs. Such results are expected to have an important positive impact, because in addition to significant advances in blood transfusion and drug delivery, what is learned will contribute to a broader understanding of multiphase flow in microfluidics, the interfacial dynamics of nanostructure materials and their interactions with surrounding biological media. Consequently, the proposed research is expected to provide unique and otherwise unattainable conceptual, experimental and therapeutic advances in nano-bio phenomena and processes. Furthermore, once such strategies are available, there is a promise that artificial RBCs can be used as a universal type of RBCs (no need to match blood types) for safe and urgent (on-spot) blood transfusion and controlled drug delivery, which will impact significantly the nation and the global society. In addition, our research aims are coupled to our educational and outreach programs, benefiting minority and underrepresented groups, K-12 students, and graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, the experimental projects in this proposal are excellent opportunities for training young researchers in timely questions, nano/micro technologies, high-speed imaging, data analysis, presentations skills, etc. Especially as nano/micro technology is a popular theme, and the various imaging tools and experimental methods are excellent training modules."

Research on species distribution has primarily focused on modern climate variation and species distributions. In this project, a novel combination of paleontological and modern ecological data will be used to examine how past climate patterns and competition among mammals have contributed to current primate biodiversity. As habitat loss and fragmentation are occurring worldwide, research investigating the factors determining primate biodiversity has implications for conservation management and maintaining the integrity of tropical forest ecosystems. Obtaining a better understanding of how primate distributions change through time and in response to changing environments will inform models for predicting shifts in primate ranges and community structure for future climates and habitat changes. The project will include the development of a database and web-based science education resources, and training of students from traditionally under-represented populations in the STEM fields. Students will gain important skills in data management and analyses that can subsequently be used in a wide variety of future career paths.  <br/><br/>The project seeks to examine primate community phylogenetic and trait structure across space and through time with abiotic and biotic factors suggested to cause the changing distributions and adaptations of primate species. The project is unique because fossil species locations and traits will be integrated with extant community data for macro-ecological and evolutionary analyses. Some of the questions addressed will be: Do communities found in similar environments, but on different continents, converge on the same structures? Do climate patterns from the Miocene through the present influence primate community structure? Do the presence and diversity of non-primate mammals that are potential primate competitors impact primate community structure? Are trait and phylogenetic structures of fossil primate communities predicted by climatic characteristics? The research proposed in this project will address topics that are central to understanding the modern and past distribution and coexistence of primates and other mammals. Using a community-level approach is essential for understanding how species interact to impact the evolution of each other's behavior, ecology, and morphology. Obtaining a better understanding of how primate communities change through time and in response to changing environments will inform models for predicting future shifts in primate distributions and community structure related to climate and habitat change."

Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond."

While the measures of ground motion intensity would have indicated moderate structural damage, instead ten reinforced concrete buildings collapsed and hundreds more have been reported to have severe damage as a consequence of the earthquake. This damage was surprising because Taiwan has made considerable investments into earthquake research, regulations, enforcement, and strengthening. To understand this discrepancy in reinforced concrete building performance, this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will fund a team of researchers from the United States to travel to Taiwan to work with Taiwanese researchers to gather detailed building response data, including the observed damage and properties of building structures in quantifiable terms.  Both damaged and undamaged buildings will be surveyed to produce a comprehensive data set that can be used to test hypotheses on causes of damage. The data set will be used to: (1) understand causes of building collapse, (2) identify building properties that increase probability of structural damage, (3) identify vulnerable structures in seismic areas, in particular older structures built prior to modern seismic design codes, and (4) study the relationship of the site response and building damage.  Because Taiwan has adopted seismic design methodologies similar to those in the United States, this data set also will help improve understanding of the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings in the United States. <br/><br/>The U.S. team will work with researchers from Taiwan's National Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering and National Cheng Kung University to gather data from 100 to 150 buildings affected by this earthquake.  For each surveyed building, collected information will include: structural damage, geotechnical damage, structural configuration, key dimensions, building drawings, year of building code used for design, material properties, and for selected buildings, high-resolution image sequences to produce digital damage maps that can be used to quantify damage and performance in clear terms.  Breaking with common practice, the team will survey both damaged and undamaged buildings, as well as retrofitted buildings. The project will produce a comprehensive data set, including information on ground motion (Taiwan has one of the densest networks of accelerometers in the world), geotechnical information, structural information, and observed performance.   The data set will enable detailed engineering studies of specific buildings and sites.  In total, the data set will form a ""testbed"" to: (1) evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies used to evaluate building vulnerability, including vulnerability to collapse, (2) develop new damage indicators for rapid screening of the built infrastructure, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of retrofit strategies. The data set will be archived in the data repository on the DesignSafe-CI.org web site for broad use by researchers, educators, and the practicing engineering community in the United States, Taiwan, and other countries.

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.<br/><br/>The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change."

This infrastructure has become known as MPWR: Mentoring and Partnerships for Women in RUME. The project will include support for this infrastructure for an additional three years. What's more, after the previous two annual iterations, the MPWR infrastructure is sufficiently established to be studied as a model to support women in undergraduate STEM education research.<br/><br/>The positioning of women in RUME in mathematics departments compounds multiple known issues -- such as women in academia, women in mathematics, education researchers in mathematics departments, more specifically, RUME experts in mathematics departments -- exacerbating the potential for marginalization.

As humans deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs, new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls. Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability, and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications, such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic dredging and excavation."

Today, there is no broadband wireless communication available<br/>underwater.

The speed of sound is 200,000<br/>times slower than the speed of radio propagation, and mobile acoustic transmitters and<br/>receivers hence suffer from severe Doppler distortion.

This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology."

Much of this carbon uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where water from the deep ocean comes to the surface. How much water ""up-wells,"" and therefore how much carbon is absorbed, is believed to depend on the strength and location of the major westerly winds in the southern hemisphere.  These wind patterns have been shifting southward in recent decades, and future changes could impact the global carbon cycle and promote the circulation of relatively warm water from the deep ocean on to the continental shelf, which contributes to enhanced Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise. Understanding of the westerly winds and their role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the circulation of ocean water is therefore very important.   The work supported by this award will study past movement of the SH westerlies in response to natural climate variations. Of particular interest is the last deglaciation (20,000 to 10,000 years ago), when the global climate made a transition from an ice age climate to the current warm period.  During this period, atmospheric carbon dioxide rose from about 180 ppm to 270 parts per million, and one leading hypothesis is that the rise in carbon dioxide was driven by a southward movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies.  The broader impacts of the work include a perspective on past movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies and their link to atmospheric carbon dioxide, which could guide projections of future oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, with strong societal benefits; international collaboration with German scientists; training of a postdoctoral investigator; and outreach to public schools. <br/> <br/>This project will investigate whether the abundance of a noble gas, krypton-86, trapped in Antarctic ice cores, records atmospheric pressure variability, and whether or not this pressure variability can be used to infer past movement of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. The rationale for the project is that models of air movement in the snow pack (firn) in Antarctica indicate that pressure variations drive air movement that disturbs the normal enrichment in krypton-86 caused by gravitational settling of gases.  Calculations predict that the krypton-86 deviation from gravitational equilibrium reflects the magnitude of pressure variations.  In turn, atmospheric data show that pressure variability over Antarctica is linked to the position of the southern hemisphere westerly winds. Preliminary data from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core show a large excursion in krypton-86 during the transition from the last ice age to the current warm period.  The investigators will perform krypton-86 analysis on ice core and firn air samples to establish whether the krypton-86 deviation is linked to pressure variability, refine the record of krypton isotopes from the WAIS Divide ice core, investigate the role of pressure variability in firn air transport using firn air models, and investigate how barometric pressure variability in Antarctica is linked to the position/strength of the SH westerlies in past and present climates."

Those same conditions in adults can also be traced back to events early in life. Therefore understanding how organisms respond to environmental stress is crucial. However, this has been challenging partly because although responses to stress have been studied at but the cellular and whole organism level, scientists have not yet made a successful link between stress to the whole animal and the cellular consequences. The goals of the project are to 1) improve our understanding of stress responses at both levels and 2) critically evaluate how the stress response is regulated. This project also aims to improve science literacy and inquiry-based science education in rural regions of Alabama. First, this project will contribute to a more holistic view of how organisms respond to stress, and will teach middle and high-school students how events at molecular and whole-animal levels are interconnected. Second, models describing stress response regulation have been applied to evaluate diseases risk factors, e.g., obesity and socioeconomic status. This project will educate Alabamian public school students about the consequences of obesity, lifestyle, and diet and how to overcome stress. Finally, the participation in, and quality of, science fair projects in southeastern Alabama has been extremely low, although such projects provide a great opportunity to implement an inquiry-based approach to science education. In collaboration with biology teachers, the project will provide training, mentorship, and opportunities to conduct science fair projects to spark interests in biology, inspire scientific careers, and increase science literacy in regions historically underserved in STEM education.<br/><br/>Conceptualizing and studying stress has been challenging because stress responses extend across multiple biological scales, and the consequences of stress are often non-linear. This lack of integration is a major obstacle in this field, and is well exemplified by glucocorticoid- and heat shock protein-focused studies of stress responses. Therefore, this project will characterize an integrative stress response involving both HSPs and glucocorticoids. Specifically, this project will test the hypothesis that HSPs and glucocorticoids prime each other's response in preparation for subsequent stressors by determining whether 1) glucocorticoids elevate HSP and associated transcription factor and 2) a disruption in proteostasis, as regulated by the heat shock response pathway, elicits glucocorticoid responses. Elevation of HSPs and glucocorticoids has both protective and damaging effects. The allostasis model conceptualizes this non-linear nature of stress, yet this model has not been explicitly tested. Using zebra finches which adjust their heat tolerance with prior heat-conditioning, the project will also evaluate the allostasis model by testing the hypothesis that pre-conditioned birds elicit greater HSP and glucocorticoid responses than birds with no prior exposure to the stressor, thereby protecting individuals from stress-related suppression of reproductive and immune functions. By defining the direct and reciprocal relationship between HSP and glucocorticoid responses, this project will characterize organismal orchestration of the HSP response and provide a molecular basis for the switch from protective to damaging effects of glucocorticoids. Furthermore, this project will provide an in-depth evaluation of the allostasis model and whether this model applies to a stressor beyond nutritional stress."

But low-level code in unsafe languages attracts security vulnerabilities, developer productivity suffers without the software engineering benefits of higher-level languages, and in the age of heterogeneous hardware and big data workloads, a single hand-optimized codebase may no longer provide good performance across different target platforms. Generative programming is a radical rethinking of the role of high-level languages and low-level languages. Instead of running whole systems in a high-level managed language runtime, the idea is to focus the abstraction power of high-level languages on composing pieces of low-level code, making runtime code generation and domain-specific optimization a fundamental part of the program logic.  This project will conduct a fundamental study of generative design patterns, which will be extracted from existing and emerging program generators and domain-specific languages. The intellectual merits are a deeper understanding of how to develop software in a generative style.

But while the general idea of program generation is well understood, the technique has remained esoteric?a black art, accessible only to the most skilled and daring of programmers. What is missing is a discipline of practical generative programming, including design patterns, best practices and so on. To achieve these broader goals, the project includes an education program, which, driven by the project?s research, will teach generative programming to a wide audience of students and developers in industry. This education effort will also serve as a large-scale usability study, closing the feedback loop into the research on generative programming techniques."

Abrupt transitions from cold to warm North Atlantic climate states, spaced several millennia apart, were generally associated with increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. While surface climate also varied on shorter, millennial time scales, atmospheric carbon dioxide variability on this time scale was negligible. Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on the longer times scale, and surface climate on both time scales, are generally attributed to changes in circulation within the deep ocean, but our knowledge of deep ocean circulation variability during the last ice age is limited. Detailed knowledge of glacial circulation variability is required to understand the influence of deep ocean circulation variability on surface climate and atmospheric carbon. This project supports education and training of an undergraduate student and a post-graduate investigator. All data generated as part of this study will be made publicly available. The data will also be valuable to the climate modeling community, which uses paleoclimate data to test the same models used to predict future climate change.<br/><br/>Bottom water temperature estimates, determined from elemental ratios of benthic foraminifera, from a tropical North Atlantic sediment core, will be used to identify times of deep ocean circulation change during the last 65,000 years. Models predict large and rapid warming at the location and depth (~550 m) of the sediment core in association with a weakening of deep Atlantic water originating from the North Atlantic region. The sediment core has high accumulation rates (>30 cm/kyr), and variations in magnetic susceptibility that can be tied directly to Greenland ice core &#948;18O variations. Proposed radiocarbon and planktonic foraminiferal &#948;18O analysis will further refine the chronology. Reconstructing deep ocean variability during the last ice age is critical to understanding the role of deep ocean circulation in driving glacial atmospheric carbon dioxide variability, which generally varies significantly only on longer, multi-millennial, time-scale. On the other hand, confirming that deep ocean circulation did (or did not) vary on the shorter millennial time scale will help determine whether or not observed large climate shifts in, for example, tropical Atlantic hydrology, occurred in the absence of deep ocean circulation change. Such a finding would imply that episodes of North Atlantic cooling have significant and widespread climate impacts in the absence of changes in ocean dynamics."

Male fruit flies of the genus Drosophila carry out a complex and stereotyped courtship ritual that provides an excellent model in which to study these processes. The correct performance of this ritual is critical for success in mating and reproduction. Mutations affecting the courtship ritual typically result in slow courtship, or failure to court entirely.  However, we have identified a gene (Tre1) that, when mutated, causes unusually rapid performance of the ritual. This result is unique, and suggests a previously unknown function in mating behavior: delay of courtship. This research project aims to answer two questions: first, why would a gene exist whose function appears to be to reduce the speed of mating, which would seem to put males at a disadvantage relative to males that mate more quickly? Second, in what cells does the Tre1 gene function, and what are these cells doing during courtship behavior? In addition, to increase the exposure of women and underrepresented minority students to basic scientific research, an integral component of this project is to establish a summer mentorship program that brings high school biology teachers from local minority-serving high schools, together with their students, to the lab to design and implement behavioral genetics experiments for their classrooms.<br/><br/>Drosophila males engage in a stereotyped courtship ritual in order to gain the favor of females. Previous research has shown that the typical result of failure to perform any of the steps correctly and in the correct order results in greatly reduced opportunities to mate. In addition, the behavioral sex determination gene fruitless (fru) has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to direct all steps of courtship behavior. Loss of the male-specific fru transcripts (fruM) typically leads to increased latency to court, inappropriate mate choice, or failure to court at all. We identified a GAL4-transgene that is inserted into the coding sequence of the Tre1 GPCR gene (Tre1-GAL4). When this GAL4 line is used to drive expression of either an RNAi targeting fruM or the feminizing transgene UAS-traF, it results in male flies that initiate courtship and achieve copulation much more quickly than control animals. This phenotype is recapitulated in males mutant for Tre1, which indicates that the Tre1 GPCR is required for normal courtship behavior. The expression pattern of Tre1-GAL4 is limited, with expression in regions consistent with olfactory reception and processing in both the peripheral and central nervous system. The activities described in this proposal identify positively the Tre1-GAL4 cells, investigate the function of those cells in courtship initiation, test the hypothesis that the Tre1-GAL4 cells are involved in mate choice, and further investigate the role of Tre1 itself in courtship initiation."

In particular, the advent of affordable and portable electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement devices has enabled collection and storage of hours of detailed information about patients? personal cardiovascular system. However, the untrained individual's limited ability to interpret this raw information limits the revolutionary healthcare potential of such technology. Consequently, there is no decrease in required face-to-face visits with a physician, and many ethical questions arise regarding storage, transmission and responsibility of the doctor to monitor such information. In this project, this I-Corps team outlines a strategy for taking such technology to the next level of personalization by incorporating a novel metric for cardiovascular health into currently available portable ECG measurement devices.<br/><br/>The ability to extract meaningful information from a large set of data is of paramount importance in the digital age. At its core, the proposed technology isolates the degrees of freedom within the cardiovascular system that govern a particular aspect of the heart's response to external stresses including pollutants. By enabling real-time measurement of the cardiac muscle physical ability to recover from a single contraction through the so-called ""reserve of refractoriness"" (RoR), the door to non-invasive assessment of exposure to arbitrary types of potential pollutants is opened. A remarkable feature of introduced metric is its lack of sensitivity to the inherent noise in low-resolution, single-lead ECG measurement devices. Such a stiffness makes the proposed refractoriness metric an ideal method for analyzing the cardiovascular system in a variety of practical contexts. Specifically, the proposed technology demonstrates how it may be rewarding for the medical industry, companies with concern for occupational or environmental hazards, as well as for the vast fitness industry."

While the measures of ground motion intensity would have indicated moderate structural damage, instead ten reinforced concrete buildings collapsed and hundreds more have been reported to have severe damage as a consequence of the earthquake. This damage was surprising because Taiwan has made considerable investments into earthquake research, regulations, enforcement, and strengthening. To understand this discrepancy in reinforced concrete building performance, this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will fund a team of researchers from the United States to travel to Taiwan to work with Taiwanese researchers to gather detailed building response data, including the observed damage and properties of building structures in quantifiable terms.  Both damaged and undamaged buildings will be surveyed to produce a comprehensive data set that can be used to test hypotheses on causes of damage. The data set will be used to: (1) understand causes of building collapse, (2) identify building properties that increase probability of structural damage, (3) identify vulnerable structures in seismic areas, in particular older structures built prior to modern seismic design codes, and (4) study the relationship of the site response and building damage.  Because Taiwan has adopted seismic design methodologies similar to those in the United States, this data set also will help improve understanding of the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings in the United States. <br/><br/>The U.S. team will work with researchers from Taiwan's National Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering and National Cheng Kung University to gather data from 100 to 150 buildings affected by this earthquake.  For each surveyed building, collected information will include: structural damage, geotechnical damage, structural configuration, key dimensions, building drawings, year of building code used for design, material properties, and for selected buildings, high-resolution image sequences to produce digital damage maps that can be used to quantify damage and performance in clear terms.  Breaking with common practice, the team will survey both damaged and undamaged buildings, as well as retrofitted buildings. The project will produce a comprehensive data set, including information on ground motion (Taiwan has one of the densest networks of accelerometers in the world), geotechnical information, structural information, and observed performance.   The data set will enable detailed engineering studies of specific buildings and sites.  In total, the data set will form a ""testbed"" to: (1) evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies used to evaluate building vulnerability, including vulnerability to collapse, (2) develop new damage indicators for rapid screening of the built infrastructure, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of retrofit strategies. The data set will be archived in the data repository on the DesignSafe-CI.org web site for broad use by researchers, educators, and the practicing engineering community in the United States, Taiwan, and other countries.

Approximately 200,000 repair surgeries are carried out in the U.S. every year. However, with current strategies, few patients reach a full functional recovery. Currently, the preferred intervention takes 'less important' nerve from the patient to aid regeneration at the site of injury, leading to multiple surgical sites and tissue morbidity. Therefore, there is a clear need for synthetic nerve guidance channels to effectively replace the use of patients' own tissue. The advantages of the proposed technique to produce nerve guidance channels are a consistent high yield and internal fiber features that are defined on the macroscale, reducing the need for expensive microfabrication techniques. This team has harnessed this materials processing technique to work with biologically relevant polymers as well as incorporating features including electrodes and topography to enhance tissue growth. The proposed guidance channels have shown promise for guiding and enhancing the rate of nerve growth, but much work both on the technical and business side of this project is required to translate this technology to the market and ultimately to patients.<br/><br/>This team's current hypothesis is that the end user for the proposed technology will be the patient and the primary customer will be the surgeon who implants the device. Additional stakeholders may be, but are not limited to: procurement officers, primary care physicians, and/or hospital technology officers.  The I-Corps program and aggressive customer discovery will be paramount in identifying the key stakeholders involved in all aspects of commercialization, including product production, customer acquisition, and end usage.  The team aims to use the I-Corps program process to build its understanding of customers and value propositions by interviewing 80-q100 stakeholders, and also plan to expand further the material library to further improve the biocompatibility and efficacy of the nerve guidance channels."

The new process is an order of magnitude better in energy cost than current practices, and also emits well below half the carbon dioxide (CO2) of the most efficient existing metallurgical processes. The goal of the project is to generate the necessary process data to evaluate scalability and cost-effectiveness of this solid-oxide-membrane-based green electrolytic process for semiconductor and solar grade silicon production. Upon successful implementation, this process will demonstrate several advantages over current processes. They include: very low energy usage relative to free energy required for silicon dioxide (SiO2) reduction; use of inexpensive raw materials that require little to no pre-treatment; no carbothermic reduction, which emits 10 kg of CO2 per kg silicon (Si) product and whose contaminants typically reduce purity of silicon from 99.6% in natural quartzite to 97-98% in metallurgical grade (MG) Si; possibility of inherent boron removal by borium triflouride (BF3) volatilization; absence of any carbon or chlorine in the process; and there are no anode effects resulting in perfluro and/or perchloro carbon emissions. <br/><br/>Current methods for Si production include, fluidized bed reduction processes, carbothermic reduction of high-purity silica, slag/crystal refining, liquid Si electrorefining, and electrolysis of chlorides and fluorides. Some of the major limitations of these processes include extensive raw materials pre-processing, low yields, detrimental environmental impact and substantial energy requirements. In the proposed process, a one-end-closed oxygen-ion-conducting stabilized zirconia (SOM) tube will be used to separate pure silica (SiO2) dissolved in molten flux from an inert anode placed inside the SOM tube. To ensure product purity, a pre-reduction step using a secondary cathode at lower applied potentials will be employed to remove impurities that are more electronegative than Si. The impurity-laden secondary cathode will be removed, and then employing a liquid tin cathode the applied potential will be increased to reduce silica. The Si reduced will go into solution in the liquid tin cathode. Less electronegative impurity ions compared to Si will remain in the flux. Thus impurity oxides of both more and less electronegative impurities are not reduced along with silica. Si is over 95 atom% soluble in liquid tin at high temperatures but at lower temperatures pure Si and Sn are immiscible. This will allow directional solidification to be employed after electrolysis to produce high-purity Si ingots and demonstrate this as a cost-effective carbon-free method for mass production of Si from commercially available sources of silica. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to work with our industrial partners and move the technology closer towards commercialization. It will also provide a rich set of case-study materials for introduction into both undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching.<br/><br/>Infinium, a clean metals company, and SunEdison Semiconductors, consumer of semiconductor grade silicon will be engaged in the research program to assess quality, scalability and cost-effectiveness of the green technology for mass production of silicon starting from commercially available sources of silica."

Yet, while there is increasing access to these environments, biological collection and the molecular biology and biochemical analysis of these environments is still highly challenging. One source of this challenge is the robotic collection arms currently used in these environments. Commercially-available deep sea manipulation systems are designed to perform heavy mechanical work (i.e., construction or pipeline maintenance) and are not geared to perform delicate tasks, such as the collection of fragile biological specimens. Details for the design and construction of this instrument will be made available to the public.  <br/><br/>The new instrument is based on soft robots and will enable unparalleled sampling in the deep sea environment.

The non-traditional bilateral control software and underwater actuators are innovative, and the modular design with multiple grippers makes this system extremely flexible for wide range of biological sampling. The gripping surface will incorporate micro scale surface textures that minimize damage to delicate biological samples.

Detection of viruses associated with sewage, such as coliphage, requires sending a water sample to an off-site laboratory.  In the lab,  the samples are spread onto petri dishes covered with a smooth lawn of host bacteria.  In about 24 hours, the virus causes visible clear areas called plaques to form in the lawn of bacteria.  The plaques are counted and results are sent back.  The process takes 2-3 days and costs $20-50.  This I-Corps team has designed a test kit for detecting fecal matter viruses in contaminated recreational water.  The team genetically engineered a strain of E. coli bacteria so that when particular types of virus are present, the bacteria produce a red color.  The intensity of the red color that develops is related to the amount of bacteriophage present in the contaminated water.  The test can be run in less than 4 hours, offering a considerable competitive advantage over current virus detection methods.  It will be easy to use and to read,  detecting the coliphage with a simple color change.   This would help officials at the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) and the Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to test the water at a beach in the morning, and post the same day contamination status or close the beach before people are exposed to contaminated water conditions.  <br/><br/>This project offers a swift and inexpensive way to detect harmful coliphage virus contamination in recreational waters.

Such systems generally cannot be fully described in closed analytical form (mathematical expressions that can be written down) for more than two particles, even if their individual properties and the forces between them are precisely known. This dilemma is well-known as the ""few-body problem"" and it limits the extent to which one can predict the states of the particles (e.g. their positions and velocities) for any time in the future. Therefore, advancing the knowledge of phenomena that emerge due to the complex interplay of several particles requires the joined theoretical and experimental exploration for a wide range of situations. In this project, few-body phenomena of quantum systems consisting of atoms, their electrically charged components (electrons and ions), and photons (the particles of light) will be studied. Such quantum systems represent an ideal testing ground of few-body physics for multiple reasons: First, few-body effects in these systems are ubiquitous and relevant to many research fields and numerous technical applications, particularly in areas such as materials science, quantum chemistry, biological science, and information processing. Second, advanced experimental techniques are available which allow manipulation of the parameters of the few-particle quantum state with a high degree of control and accuracy. Moreover, modern spectrometers enable snapshots to be taken of the state's change over time, allowing details of the state's dynamics to be analyzed. Techniques for the control of atomic few-body systems and for the analysis of their dynamics which have been developed in the past twenty years (largely independently of each other) will be combined in the present project for the first time. This will enable the observation of few-body quantum phenomena while being able to tune the system parameters, and it will allow benchmarking theoretical models.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, this project involves the control and analysis of atomic few-body systems using laser cooling and manipulation techniques to prepare a large variety of initial states, ranging from single excited or polarized lithium atoms to large ensembles of atoms that are cooled to quantum-degeneracy. Systems of only very few atoms can be confined in a micrometer-sized optical dipole trap and their interaction can be tuned close to Feshbach resonances. For the analysis, a ""reaction microscope"" will be employed allowing the coincident measurements of the momentum vectors of atomic fragments after ionization of the lithium atoms by femtosecond or attosecond laser pulses. In essence, there are three fundamental questions to be addressed in the proposed experiments: First, how do the ionization dynamics depend on the relative orientation (or helicity) of an ionizing laser field and a polarized target atom? Such experiments will help to understand fundamental symmetries and ultimately control the interaction of laser fields with chiral (atomic or molecular) targets, which play a crucial role e.g. in biochemistry. Second, how is the disintegration of an atom due to the interaction with an ionizing field influenced by its environment? This is experimentally only studied for clusters or solid targets, but largely unexplored for more dilute systems. Apart from the fundamental importance of this question, the dependence of the ionization dynamics on the environment is relevant to the understanding of the damage of biological tissue due to radiation. Finally, how does the correlated wave function of a few-particle system change as a function of the particle number and interaction type and strength? The possibility to ""engineer"" simple few-body systems and observe such systems comprehensively would allow one to ""simulate"" and understand fundamental quantum phenomena that occur in natural or artificial materials."

Before the core is even processed, data from the borehole probe will immediately determine the depth-age relationship, augment 3D mapping of South Pole stratigraphy, aid in searches for the oldest ice in Antarctica, and reveal layers of volcanic or extraterrestrial fallout.  Regarding the intellectual merit, the oriented borehole log will be essential for investigating features in the ice sheet that may have implications for ice core chronology, ice flow, ice sheet physical properties and stability in response to climate change.  The tools and techniques developed in this program have applications in glaciology, biogeoscience and exploration of other planetary bodies. The program aims for a deeper understanding of the consequences and causes of abrupt climate change. The broader impacts of the project are that it will include outreach and education, providing a broad training ground for students and post-docs.  Data and metadata will be made available through data centers and repositories such as the National Snow and Ice Data Center web portal. <br/><br/>The laser dust logger detects reproducible paleoclimate features at sub-centimeter depth scale.  Dust logger data are being used for synchronizing records and dating any site on the continent, revealing accumulation anomalies and episodes of rapid ice sheet thinning, and discovering particulate horizons of special interest.  In this project we will deploy a laser dust logger equipped with a magnetic compass to find direct evidence of preferentially oriented dust.  Using optical scattering measurements from IceCube calibration studies at South Pole and borehole logs at WAIS Divide, we have detected a persistent anisotropy correlated with flow and crystal fabric which suggests that the majority of insoluble particulates must be located within ice grains.  With typical concentrations of parts-per-billion, little is known about the location of impurities within the polycrystalline structure of polar ice.  While soluble impurities are generally thought to concentrate at inter-grain boundaries and determine electrical conductivity, the fate of insoluble particulates is much less clear, and microscopic examinations are extremely challenging.  These in situ borehole measurements will help to unravel intimate relationships between impurities, flow, and crystal fabric.  Data from this project will further develop a unique record of South Pole surface roughness as a proxy for paleowind and provide new insights for understanding glacial radar propagation.

It uses the case of a police department's project of redrawing its district boundaries in the context of a highly segregated Rust Belt city.  In contrast to many redistricting efforts that aim to more evenly distribute urban service provision across a jurisdiction, this redistricting intended to concentrate distinct policing problems within the new districts.  In so doing, it created more racially homogenous districts and opened the door for divergence in policing practices.  This study examines the motivations for and consequences of this reform.  It aims to expand our understanding of the varied roles that the police play in projects of social control and service provision by identifying the relational and socially constructed nature of policing priorities across the city. The research has the potential to inform policing and to improve relationships between police and the policed.<br/><br/>The researcher describes the motivations for and consequences of the redistricting through a multi-method design that links the structural context of racial residential segregation to institutional priorities that in turn shape on-the-ground policing. First, the researcher will interview 80 stakeholders involved in or affected by the redistricting in order to identify the networks and interests that structured the redistricting process. Next, the researcher explores the current social organization of police work at the district-level through a year of ethnographic observation of two of the most affected districts. Finally, the researcher describes the intended and unintended consequences of the change through longitudinal analysis of calls for service data, arrest and citation data, crime data, and demographic data. In examining the relationship between residential segregation and policing styles, the researcher identifies the dynamics of policing that not only re-inscribe and maintain segregation boundaries, but reconstitute the nature of segregation by actively creating different kinds of spaces in the city. Thus, this research both contributes to sociology of crime, criminology and community studies but it also contributes to strengthening the relationship between police and the policed. It contributes to understanding how to change the processes that lead to the material and symbolic racial disparities that characterizes these relationships and attends to broader historical and institutional processes as well as mandates at the institutional level."

Producing enough food and energy for a world population likely exceeding 9.7 billion by 2050 is the greatest challenge facing agriculture. Compared to modern genomic sequencing technologies, plant phenomics lags behind in its capacity and throughput. The instrument developed in this research will alleviate this limitation, allow more efficient genotype-phenotype analysis, and ultimately catalyze the acceleration of crop improvements (in terms of yield and stress tolerance) to solve the looming global food security challenge. The project will foster a collaborative environment where the postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in plant biology, biological engineering, and computer science. The team will develop course materials that allow students in traditional plant biology to learn the new domain knowledge of sensing, instrumentation and data processing (this is a perceived gap in university plant biology curriculum). Discoveries from the project will be presented at international conferences on plant science and biological engineering and published in peer reviewed journals. The team will also collaborate with plant scientists at UNL and plant phenotyping groups around the world for the broad dissemination of the instrument. <br/><br/>This instrument can simultaneously probe chemical properties of plants (such as water, nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentration) through LASER imaging and measure 3D plant structure (such as size and spatial orientation of individual leaves) through LASER ranging. Through these measurements, more parameters related to plant physiology and functions (such as photosynthesis and stomatal activity) can be extracted. All the parameters will be spatially co-registered, eliminating the need for tedious data fusion. New algorithms will be developed to process massive 3D LASER point clouds and reconstruct plant leaf and stem surfaces. The performance of the instrument will be rigorously validated through a series of experiments involving stressed versus healthy plants. Taken together, the instrument provides transformative improvement in both capacity and throughput for plant shoot phenotyping, which will in turn benefit many fields of basic and applied plant biology research."

Software consists of data fusion and data-2-decision algorithms developed via our previously funded NSF technology (i.e. localization of a node). Functionally, each node is capable of detecting anomalies (e.g. high temperature and low moisture) and sending alert signals to the base station. The system alerts the farmer (or an autonomous vehicle) and offers precise localization and navigation to the concerned site for executing real-time remedial measures.

A common way that social scientists learn about individuals' traits and beliefs is to have people answer many closely related questions about the same topic. These large multi-item batteries are used to measure constructs like personality traits, psychological illnesses, political ideology, personal values, levels of knowledge, and more.  Public opinion researchers, however, often choose not to use these widely respected multi-item batteries because of concerns regarding respondent burden or the costs of long surveys.  The standard solution is to select a subset of the available items, which then are administered to all respondents.  Such static-reduced batteries are well known to increase bias and lower measurement precision, however.  CAT ameliorates much of the decreased measurement precision and accuracy associated with static-reduced scales.  The project builds on existing work in the fields of educational testing and psychometrics to develop software and an online webservice that adopts and adjusts CAT for the specific needs of public opinion researchers.<br/><br/>This research project will apply CAT algorithms to the domain of survey research and provide practical resources and theoretical guidance specific to the needs of public opinion researchers.  CAT algorithms adapt dynamically to measure latent constructs while minimizing the number of questions each respondent must answer.  This approach uses information about the qualities of each question item to respond to individuals' prior answers by choosing subsequent questions that will place them on the latent dimension with maximum precision and a minimum number of questions. That is, it chooses questions for each respondent based on their previous responses so that researchers can learn as much as possible about the opinions of a respondent.  The project will provide basic software infrastructure necessary for developing CAT batteries and administering them on surveys. This includes the completion and hosting of a cloud-based webservice easily integrated into survey-administration software.  The project also will provide solutions to problems likely to confront survey researchers fielding adaptive batteries including appropriately handling high levels of measurement error and diagnosing flawed question-item calibrations. Finally, the project will collect data to build adaptive batteries measuring important concepts in the social sciences, with a special emphasis on personality inventories, using a combination of large convenience samples, a nationally representative sample, and existing datasets.  The distribution of these calibrations will allow researchers to use CAT techniques without the added cost of extensive pre-testing."

Much of this carbon uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where water from the deep ocean comes to the surface. How much water ""up-wells,"" and therefore how much carbon is absorbed, is believed to depend on the strength and location of the major westerly winds in the southern hemisphere.  These wind patterns have been shifting southward in recent decades, and future changes could impact the global carbon cycle and promote the circulation of relatively warm water from the deep ocean on to the continental shelf, which contributes to enhanced Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise. Understanding of the westerly winds and their role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the circulation of ocean water is therefore very important.   The work supported by this award will study past movement of the SH westerlies in response to natural climate variations. Of particular interest is the last deglaciation (20,000 to 10,000 years ago), when the global climate made a transition from an ice age climate to the current warm period.  During this period, atmospheric carbon dioxide rose from about 180 ppm to 270 parts per million, and one leading hypothesis is that the rise in carbon dioxide was driven by a southward movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies.  The broader impacts of the work include a perspective on past movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies and their link to atmospheric carbon dioxide, which could guide projections of future oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, with strong societal benefits; international collaboration with German scientists; training of a postdoctoral investigator; and outreach to public schools. <br/> <br/>This project will investigate whether the abundance of a noble gas, krypton-86, trapped in Antarctic ice cores, records atmospheric pressure variability, and whether or not this pressure variability can be used to infer past movement of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. The rationale for the project is that models of air movement in the snow pack (firn) in Antarctica indicate that pressure variations drive air movement that disturbs the normal enrichment in krypton-86 caused by gravitational settling of gases.  Calculations predict that the krypton-86 deviation from gravitational equilibrium reflects the magnitude of pressure variations.  In turn, atmospheric data show that pressure variability over Antarctica is linked to the position of the southern hemisphere westerly winds. Preliminary data from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core show a large excursion in krypton-86 during the transition from the last ice age to the current warm period.  The investigators will perform krypton-86 analysis on ice core and firn air samples to establish whether the Kr-86 deviation is linked to pressure variability, refine the record of krypton isotopes from the WAIS Divide ice core, investigate the role of pressure variability in firn air transport using firn air models, and investigate how barometric pressure variability in Antarctica is linked to the position/strength of the SH westerlies in past and present climates."

Support from this grant for the conference ""New Advances in Probing Cell-Extracellular Matrix Interactions; Berlin, Germany; October 21 - 22, 2016"" will enable young investigators to meet senior scientists and to understand technologies at the cutting edge of the field.<br/><br/>Recent progress in cell mechanotransduction research has been facilitated by advances of experimental tools. Microtechnologies have enabled the design and fabrication of controlled physical microenvironments for the study and measurement of cell-ECM interactions. Advances in engineered biomaterials have allowed researchers to develop synthetic ECMs that mimic tissue microenvironments and investigate the impact of altered physicochemical properties on various cellular processes. Finally, advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques have facilitated the visualization of the complex interaction between cells and ECM in vitro and in living tissues. This meeting will highlight the application of recent innovations in these technologies to probing cell-ECM interactions with an aim to inspire new combinatorial experiments from the interaction of these sub-disciplines."

For example, to sense the texture of an object, a person might move her hand over the surface, whereas to measure the object's weight, she might hold it in her palm and move it up and down. This use of different movements to sense features of the environment is called Active Sensing. Although active sensing is commonplace in human behavior, how the brain generates and controls these movements is poorly understood.  The goal of this project is to reveal and describe (in mathematical equations) the brain's strategies for active sensing. This will be achieved by studying a specialized animal species, the weakly electric glass knifefish. This animal was chosen because it has a suite of properties that make it ideally suited for the experimental approach. The expected findings will have broad implications for active sensing in other animals (including humans) because active sensing behaviors are similar across species. This work will have broad societal impacts, including the possible transformation of robotic control systems and enhanced understanding of the brain that may ultimately improve our understanding of neurological disorders. Further this work includes multidisciplinary training of promising students in critical STEM fields.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis for this research is that organisms adjust active movements in order to tune the resulting sensory feedback to match processing features of CNS circuits. This is a challenging problem because sensory inputs and motor outputs are linked by a closed loop. The experimental approach overcomes this challenge by (1) exploiting unique features of a well-suited model system, weakly electric fishes, (2) developing a closed-loop behavioral control system, and (3) performing chronic neurophysiological recordings in freely swimming fish.  This integrated approach will enable the quantification of neuromechanical control strategies that organisms use to produce and modulate movements for active sensing, identification of cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying neural responses to feedback from active movements, and discovery of how these changes in active movements affect sensorimotor integration in midbrain circuits."

Contemporary digital tools in language documentation allow the integration of the building blocks, so that a linguistic database might use the dictionary to translate the narratives, use the narratives to add words to the dictionary.  Electronic databases structure a set of data, in this case language material, and they facilitate searches for information by allowing various keywords or categories to be used.  These kinds of digital documentation tools produce very rich databases, with sound files, photographs, grammar information, and entire stories, all which are possible data that can be entered and tagged.  This project will employ digital language documentation tools to process and analyze materials in an endangered Native American language, Warm Springs Ichishkiin (also known as Sahaptin). The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. By using digital tools to assist in the analysis of Native American languages, this project will increase access to linguistic and cultural materials, traditional cultural knowledge, and produce and disseminate a grammar and a dictionary. Broader impacts include training workshops for tribal citizens, and a best practices collaboration among the community elders, the tribal language program and academics.  This will broaden participation by increasing the number of Native American citizen scientists as Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs community members are trained in the scientific methods of linguistic documentation and apply them to their own language.<br/><br/>This project will document and analyze discourse, morphosyntax and semantics in the Warm Springs Ichishkiin language  which is spoken on the Warm Springs Reservation in the volcanic valleys of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, USA.

The collaborative team will include the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Language Program and community, joined by linguists from Portland State University and the Northwest Indian Language Institute of the University of Oregon. Valerie Switzler of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Nariyo Kono of Portland State University and Joana Jansen of the University of Oregon will work with digitized copies of reel-to-reel and cassette tapes as well as newly collected audio and video materials. The researchers will create transcriptions and translations that will contribute to a deeper level of understanding of lexical and grammatical features of Ichishkiin. A database, updated dictionary and updated grammar will result. Scientific interest in the language includes verbal morphology, referent tracking systems and metrical patterns, as these appear to differ in related varieties. Investigations will lead to a greater understanding of the relationships within the larger Sahaptian family, including Nez Perce and other of Ichishkiin varieties. This project will also provide a pathway to mobilizing the data and findings in the community's language programs, and in the continued maintenance of the Warm Springs Ichishkiin language within the tribe."

Many proteins, the workhorse molecules in cells, perform their functions because they adopt distinct three-dimensional shapes, or structures. These are termed folded proteins.  Knowledge of protein structure informs on protein function.  However, greater than 30% of human proteins do not adopt single, folded structures but rather are highly flexible and disordered. These are termed intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).  IDPs are involved in myriad biological functions throughout the different compartments in cells and, importantly, are associated with a wide variety of human diseases.  However, because IDPs are always moving, they are difficult to study using conventional scientific methods.  This has created a knowledge gap regarding how IDPs do their jobs in cells.  To address this gap, the conference will cover three main themes: 1) the molecular details of how IDPs do their jobs in cells, 2) novel therapeutic strategies to counteract the roles of IPDs in disease, and 3) the roles of IDPs in the formation of structures in cells termed membrane-less organelles.  In summary, this conference will address emerging topics related to a prevalent but currently poorly understood class of proteins in cells, the IDPs.  Importantly, the conference will provide opportunities for young scientists from the US, including women and member of underrepresented groups, to learn about the latest developments and build professional networks with world leaders in the IDP field.  There will be many professional opportunities for US scientists in the IDP field in the future and the conference will be a gateway to these opportunities.    <br/>  <br/>The 2016 Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) Gordon Research Conference will address important themes related to intrinsically disordered proteins, which often remain flexible and disordered when performing their biological functions and are prevalent in all life forms, including humans.  Major challenges in the IDP field include: i) understanding the diverse biological roles of IDPs, ii) understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie these diverse biological functions, and iii) relating our physical knowledge of IDPs gained in vitro to their behavior within cellular systems.  Addressing these challenges will provide explanations regarding how disorder contributes to biological function so as to understand why they have evolved in organisms across all branches of life.  Speakers at the conference will address these important challenges.  Importantly, recent studies have established that IDPs play central roles in mesoscale cellular assemblies termed membrane-less organelles through their ability to undergo phase separation into liquid-like bodies.  The conference will also address this emerging area with lectures on topics ranging from the physics of biomolecular phase separation to its roles in diverse biological processes.  Gaining fundamental molecular knowledge on how IDPs perform their diverse functions will empower applications in the areas of synthetic biology and biomaterials.  From a professional development perspective, the conference will provide opportunities for young scientists from the US, including women and members of underrepresented groups, to learn about the latest developments and build professional networks with world leaders in the IDP field.  There will be many professional opportunities for US scientists in the IDP field in the future and the conference will be a gateway to these opportunities."

Deep coral reefs, and deep sea environments in general, are hotspots for unique biological diversity and genetic adaptions that have only recently become accessible to scientists due to advances in remotely operated vehicle and submersible technology. Yet, while there is increasing access to these environments, biological collection and the molecular biology and biochemical analysis of these environments is still highly challenging. One source of this challenge is the robotic collection arms currently used in these environments. Commercially-available deep sea manipulation systems are designed to perform heavy mechanical work (i.e., construction or pipeline maintenance) and are not geared to perform delicate tasks, such as the collection of fragile biological specimens. Details for the design and construction of this instrument will be made available to the public.  <br/><br/>The new instrument is based on soft robots and will enable unparalleled sampling in the deep sea environment. This new instrument will be mounted to remotely operated vehicles and will mimic the operator's arm and hand motions for quick, nimble, and delicate interactions. Feedback to the user, integration of soft structures at multiple scales, and the development of a hair-like feedback and actuator control system that will prevent damage to fragile samples are key aspects in this novel robotic arm. The non-traditional bilateral control software and underwater actuators are innovative, and the modular design with multiple grippers makes this system extremely flexible for wide range of biological sampling. The gripping surface will incorporate micro scale surface textures that minimize damage to delicate biological samples. The long term robustness of this instrument in such harsh deep sea environments is also an important feature. By sampling this mostly unknown environment the instrumentation will benefit the molecular and cellular biology, marine biology, and biochemistry research communities."

It is hypothesized that the great diversity of mammalian species resulted from the evolution of structures associated with an ability to access, consume and process new food resources. However, this hypothesis has not been tested for the majority of mammal groups, and therefore the question of how mammalian diversity arose remains an important, unanswered one. This project will employ a suite of modern tools in the study of anatomy and physical forces associated with feeding (such as skull or cranial anatomy, and chewing or masticatory muscles) to test this hypothesis in three of the most species-rich and ecologically diverse mammal groups: bats, carnivores and primates. The research will generate unprecedented quantitative datasets on the masticatory muscles and the three-dimensional skull anatomy of over 100 species. The researchers will explore the links between these anatomical and functional (internal) factors with external factors (such as food characteristics and diversity) as a way to understand patterns of species diversification. Through this work, the project will create a large public database of mammal 3D cranial morphology, train a diverse group of students, disseminate results through a public museum exhibit, and establish cross-disciplinary collaborations among several young investigators.<br/><br/>Morphological and functional adaptations are important drivers of ecological diversification across the Tree of Life. Within mammals, it is hypothesized that many radiations were enabled by the evolution of morphological and functional traits that provided access to new dietary adaptive zones, but quantitative tests of this hypothesis are lacking for the broad diversity of mammals. This gap is partly rooted on the extensive lack of comparative datasets that integrate both the osteological and myological components of the feeding apparatus. These data, which currently exist for less than 2% of mammalian taxa, are critically needed both for an understanding of mammalian masticatory physiology and for the application of diversification analyses that contrast the relative influences of intrinsic versus extrinsic drivers of mammalian radiation. The proposed work will test macroevolutionary hypotheses about ecological diversification by generating the largest comparative datasets to date on the three-dimensional morphology, function and performance of the mammalian feeding apparatus. The team will couple micro-Computed Tomography, gross dissections, geometric morphometric analyses and biomechanical modeling to produce these data across three species-rich and ecologically diverse mammal clades (bats, carnivorans and primates). Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be used to test hypotheses about the influence of dietary selective regimes on the evolution of cranial morphology, function and performance, and their association with lineage diversification. The organismal aspect of the research will illuminate the biomechanics and ecomorphological diversity in mammal groups that are of broad scientific interest. This study will help elucidate the potential drivers of diversification in these groups while creating a foundation for further research on the physiology, biomechanics and evolution of mammal feeding."

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.<br/><br/>The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change."

Experimental studies and mechanical models have revealed how certain body shapes maximize swimming and feeding ability of the fish, in response to ecological factors such as predator presence or habitat and food availability, or in response to environment conditions such as water temperature and salinity. However, very little is known about how these ecological and environmental factors interact to explain fish body shape over evolutionary time-scales.  This research will test hypotheses of the ecological, environmental and functional drivers of body form evolution across teleost fishes using a dataset of body shape diversity that will be generated from approximately 7,500 fish species.  The project also will help to digitize the fish collections of several natural history museums making the information collected freely available to the public. Approximately 40 undergraduate students will receive training in fundamental research skills and will work together to design and execute an ambitious group research project based on the data they help to collect. Beyond illuminating the mechanisms by which life diversifies, in particular the process of convergent evolution whereby independent fish lineages have evolved similar body shapes, this study will provide the basis for identifying functional groups of fish, which are used for assessing aquatic ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This research will use a phylogenetic comparative approach to reconstruct the history of ecological shifts and biological innovations and their impact on trends in teleost shape diversity. Body-shape, including regions vital for swimming and prey-capture performance, will be estimated from approximately 20,000 teleost specimens using geometric morphometrics and linear measurements on lateral and dorsal views. The teleost ecomorphospace generated will provide the context for exploring the nature of exceptional adaptive radiations, such as the African rift lake cichlids. Large databases of biological, environmental and ecological and functional traits will be assembled from the scientific literature and museum records. Morphological convergence, novelty, and the ecological, environmental and functional factors associated with them, will be identified using an adaptive landscape approach using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in a robust phylogenetic framework.

(AUI) presents a strategic vision over the next decade to manage, operate, optimize and disseminate results from the world-leading capabilities of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). With the successful construction of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the recent enhancement of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), two new forefront facilities are moving into routine operation with ever-increasing scientific capability. Taken together, these iconic arrays fulfill a major milestone in modern astronomy, encompassing more than an order-of-magnitude leap in observational capabilities for astronomical sources at frequencies between 1 gigahertz and 1 terahertz. <br/><br/>As prioritized by multiple National Research Council Decadal Surveys in Astronomy and Astrophysics, NRAO facilities are tools for the entire scientific community that will empower discoveries across all fields of astrophysics. ALMA enables transformational research into the physics of the cold Universe, regions that are optically dark but shine brightly in the millimeter/submillimeter portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Within the broad range of science accessible with ALMA, the top-level objectives include imaging the redshifted dust continuum and molecular line emission from evolving galaxies as early as a redshift of z~10 (500 million years after the Big Bang), determining the chemical composition and dynamics of star-forming gas in normal galaxies like the Milky Way but at z~3 (75% of the way across the Universe), and measuring the gas kinematics in young disks in nearby star-forming clouds. ALMA has already demonstrated its revolutionary impact with its dramatic images of planet, star and galaxy formation. These results will accelerate as the full array becomes operational, and with the longest baselines ALMA will achieve an angular resolution of tens of milli-arseconds. ALMA provides one to two orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous facilities in all areas of millimeter- and submillimeter-wave observations, including sensitivity, angular resolution and image fidelity. <br/><br/>Likewise, at centimeter wavelengths, the broadband VLA has ushered in a new era in radio astronomy, with groundbreaking results published in areas ranging from Galactic proto-stellar clouds to images of the molecular gas in the earliest galaxies. The enhanced VLA is opening new scientific frontiers and explicitly addressing four primary science themes: measuring the strength and topology of cosmic magnetic fields; imaging young stars and massive black holes in dust-enshrouded environments; following the rapid evolution of energetic phenomena; and studying the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Improvement over previous performance is up to a factor of 10 in continuum sensitivity and coarsest frequency resolution, and a factor of 1000 or more in finest frequency resolution and the number of frequency channels.<br/><br/>In collaboration with NSF's international partners in ALMA, NRAO will transition ALMA from the current phase of commissioning and early science to full science operations. Already the most capable millimeter/submillimeter facility on the planet, in the next few years ALMA will realize significant new capabilities, further increasing ALMA's scientific productivity. The ALMA Development<br/>Program, a key component in the plan for the coming decade, will solicit and support community input and expertise in upgrading ALMA's capabilities throughout its useful lifetime.<br/><br/>Under AUI management, NRAO will implement a staged VLA infrastructure maintenance and development plan to renew and support operation of the VLA beyond the end of the next decade, followed by community-based planning and technical development for the next-generation centimeter-wave facilities. AUI will expand the NRAO Central Development Laboratory (CDL) mission to enhance NSF's existing radio astronomy facilities, to develop technology and expertise needed to build the next generation of radio astronomy instruments, and to benefit the broader economy via technology transfer. In collaboration with the university community, the CDL will support development for both ALMA and VLA and conduct leading-edge, creative research in both core and exploratory technologies that will continue to be vital to the NRAO mission in the coming decade.  <br/><br/>With plans for enhanced user support services and new data manipulation and visualization tools, AUI envisions expanding the NRAO user base beyond traditional radio astronomers and enabling multi-wavelength science by researchers and students. AUI will also ensure that NSF's investment in NRAO achieves the broadest possible impact in cutting-edge research and technical innovation, training the next generation of researchers, and inspiring students and the public.<br/><br/>Building on an existing framework of diversity activities, AUI will conduct ambitious programs to transform the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. An Office of Diversity Initiatives will lead programs, including the National Astronomy Consortium and Physics Inspiring the Next Generation, to empower under-represented students to obtain graduate degrees in STEM fields. The enhanced International/National Exchange Program and Chilean Women Graduate Internships will support international student research in radio astronomy. A key AUI objective for the NRAO workforce in the coming decade will be to move toward achieving parity with the nation's demographics for women and people of color.<br/><br/>AUI embraces an integrative approach to education and public outreach (EPO), closely aligned with NRAO research. The EPO plan builds on a comprehensive suite of programs, targeting learners of all ages, broad geographic regions, and traditionally under-represented groups, and incorporates federal STEM education initiatives that identify evidence-based best practices. NRAO will support graduate and undergraduate research, and Jansky postdoctoral fellows will carry out investigations independently, or in collaboration with staff and/or university collaborators, thus building professional relationships between NRAO and academic research groups.<br/><br/>As part of AUI's management and oversight of NRAO, AUI will regularly review the technical, financial, and administrative functioning of NRAO as well as AUI's own governance and business practices. Key Performance Indicators and both qualitative and quantitative assessments will inform NRAO activities and AUI policies to achieve optimal management and operation of NRAO."

This question is at the heart of evolutionary ecology, but has been very difficult to answer. A major problem is that current analytical approaches, known as phylogenetic comparative methods, require that a single value be used to represent a trait for an entire species. As a result, valuable information on differences among individuals within a species can't be used. This limits the types of questions that these comparative methods can address. The main goal of this project is to develop new analytical software that accounts for trait variation within species, which will result in a much more powerful computational tool. The newly developed software will be tested using experimental data from salamanders and fish. This award will have multiple broader impacts. This new tool will let a whole new set of hypotheses be tested and will be widely used by scientists doing evolutionary ecology research. Undergraduate students will receive hands-on training in mathematical modeling and software development. Educational outreach activities include a research-education exchange between a regional undergraduate university and a large research university. National and international teaching workshops will help train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world.<br/><br/>Analyses of phenotypic data tend to remain distinctly different enterprises between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies. Consequently, we still do not know how microevolutionary trends from ecological selection associate to macroevolutionary trends across phylogenies. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) measure the amount of phylogenetic signal in a set of data or account for the phylogenetic relatedness among observations when evaluating ecological variation, but currently work only with single values for species. Thus, large amounts of within-species data are disregarded when using PCMs, which limits their inferential capability. This project will develop an analytical solution to this problem, and provide a framework for extending PCMs to large data sets comprising microevolutionary data. The methods developed will allow scientists to evaluate the consistency of small-scale and large scale evolutionary relationships in a comparative framework. This project will incorporate both theoretical and empirical components.  Statistical research will evaluate the statistical power and inferential error rates of ""expanded-PCM"" to varied analytical designs, phenotypic variables, tree topologies, and data balance. These methods will be applied empirically to two vertebrate systems to study the phylogenetic relatedness of intra-species morphological variation, as it is associated with intra- and interspecific ecological variation. Several educational outreach activities will also be conducted, including: a research-in-education exchange between a primarily undergraduate university and large research university, and teaching workshops in quantitative methods to train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world."

But does this interaction make a significant difference to the Jovian magnetospheric dynamics as it does at Earth? Most believe that the effects of any interaction with the solar wind are completely overwhelmed by the effects of the rapid rotation of Jupiter's strong magnetic field and the extended torus of heavy ions created by Io's volcanoes. This question continues to be an area of active research and debate due in part to the lack of available solar wind measurements near Jupiter's orbit. The study will use a model that propagates solar wind conditions measured near Earth out to Jupiter in order to estimate solar wind conditions there. The work will examine observations of magnetic fields and particles within Jupiter's magnetosphere by the Galileo spacecraft, and images of Jupiter's aurora taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, to determine whether changes in these data may be statistically associated with changes in the modeled solar wind conditions. The results of this work will add to our knowledge of how planetary magnetospheres work, putting our understanding of the Earth's magnetosphere into a broader context, and informing the study of star-exoplanet interactions. This grant supports the training of a female postdoctoral student. Results from the research and other recent advances in space plasma physics will be presented to the public during the Boston University Astronomy Department's weekly public open night at the campus observatory while groups are waiting to use the telescopes. Additionally, the proposer will mentor graduate students at Boston University through the Graduate Women in Science and Engineering program. <br/><br/>Previous attempts have been made to model solar wind conditions at Jupiter based on solar wind conditions near Earth but the success of this technique has so far been limited by the large uncertainties in the arrival times of solar wind disturbances.  These uncertainties in turn make linking dynamical responses of Jupiter's magnetosphere to particular solar wind disturbances problematic.  The innovation in this proposal is to use the observed compression of Jupiter's magnetic field in response to the dynamic pressure changes in the solar wind to refine the arrival time of disturbances in the solar wind and minimize uncertainties in timing. The statistical correlation (or lack thereof) between the arrival of solar wind disturbances and changes in Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurora will test the importance of solar wind interactions.  Of particular importance, it will address whether quasi-periodic behavior observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere might be controlled by the solar wind. This study will also determine how Jupiter's main auroral emissions respond to changing solar wind conditions, and compare findings to theories and models."

A predictive model of video interestingness could potentially impact video retrieval, summarization, and search. This would impact fields as diverse as communication and online education. Further, just as research in image saliency was hugely accelerated by the use of eye-tracking data for training, validation, and benchmarking, this project can lead to a similar unification of diverse approaches, and efforts, around an implicit, temporally dense source of ground truth for temporal interestingness in videos."

The project focuses on the use of humanitarian claims in interventions driven primarily by national security concerns to better understand how these justifications affect the relationship between the public and war. the PI argues that high levels of public support for humanitarian interventions create an incentive for presidents to stretch the limits of humanitarian claims, which can have two unintended and potentially negative consequences. First, presidents may use humanitarian justifications to convince the public to support otherwise unpopular interventions. Second, the over-use of humanitarian claims may create a skeptical public, making it harder to build support to prevent mass atrocities in the future. The PI investigates the consequences of this use of the humanitarian frame in three ways: 1) she considers how the prominence of humanitarian justifications has changed over time, 2) she examines when presidents are most likely to rely on humanitarian claims, and 3) she examines whether there are limits to the public' willingness to accept humanitarian explanations. The research has implications for when the U.S. will intervene in the future, especially in response to mass atrocities, and for the public's ability to hold presidents accountable for military action.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>To examine the role of humanitarian justifications in contemporary U.S. military interventions, the PI employs a multi-methods approach with three distinct steps: 1) content analysis of presidential speeches, 2) comparative case studies of interventions, and 3) a survey experiment on the conditions under which individuals support humanitarian appeals. First, the PI uses dictionary-based content analysis of national presidential addresses to construct an original dataset that tracks the frequency of three justification categories for all potential U.S. interventions from 1945 to 2013. Second, she examines three pairs of interventions and non-interventions from three presidential administrations. Using primary sources from the National Security Archives and presidential libraries, these case studies examine when, within cases of intervention, presidents are most likely to emphasize humanitarian claims. The case studies also highlight how and why humanitarian concerns become a part of official justifications for military action and the role of international actors. Third, the PI uses a survey experiment to investigate the conditions under which humanitarian justifications increase support for intervention. In particular, it considers whether support is conditional on the public's belief that humanitarian claims are sincere and that military action is primarily motivated by humanitarian concerns."

For example, we know that the type and density of plants affect where sparrows can be found. However, many animals rely heavily on non-visual senses, such as hearing, when interacting with their surroundings and deciding where to live. Although the acoustic environment -- what animals hear -- may be important to many species, it remains largely unexplored as a force influencing where animals can be found. This project will examine the extent to which natural sounds, such as those generated by wind and water, influence where animals settle, how they interact with one another and, ultimately, how they structure entire communities. Focusing on birds and bats, the investigators will conduct a large-scale experiment in which they place many speakers in the forest to create ""phantom"" oceans and rivers -- the sounds of moving water without the water itself.  This will allow them to figure out how sounds can change the way in which species interact with their environment and with each other. Specifically, this study will test how noise can explain where animals live, how they behave, and the extent to which they are impacted by human-made noise generated, for example, along major highways. This study will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students at small universities and will result in an ""Acoustics in Ecology and Evolution"" workshop to teach young scientists how to incorporate acoustics into their own ecological field research.<br/><br/>Researchers will test for acoustic impacts on bird and bat communities in areas characterized by high levels of natural sounds from moving water (natural river and ocean surf sounds), low levels of natural sounds, high levels of artificially created natural sounds (phantom river and surf sounds), and spectrally-shifted, artificially created natural sounds.  The latter two treatments will be generated via large-scale playbacks of sounds recorded elsewhere. The experimental approach of playing back natural sounds at different frequencies will allow researchers to parse the influence of acoustic masking versus more general effects of sounds (e.g., disturbance and distraction) on bird and bat behavior and on community structure.  Researchers will also assess the potential role of low frequency natural sounds as acoustic beacons for habitat selection. Field work will entail a combination of behavioral experiments, bird, bat, arthropod and vegetation surveys, and spatially explicit quantification of the acoustic environment.  Researchers will test hypotheses regarding how sounds structure communities directly by masking cues used for communication or predator/prey detection, directly via elevated perceived risk through a reduction in auditory surveillance, or indirectly by altering prey distributions."

Layers of volcanic ash (tephra) embedded in glacial ice can be used to establish an accurate ice core chronology. In order to use a visible or ultrafine volcanic ash layer as a time-stratigraphic marker, a unique geochemical fingerprint must be established, and this forms the basis of our research. This award will investigate the volcanic record in the 1751 m ice core that was completed at the South Pole during the 2015/16 field season. The core is in an ideal location to link the existing, established, volcanic records in East and West Antarctica, and therefore to connect and integrate those records, allowing the climate records of ice cores to be directly compared, as well as to focus research on the most widespread and significant volcanic eruptions from West Antarctica.  Tephra derived from well-dated, large, tropical volcanic eruptions that may have had an impact on climate will also be studied.   Recent success in identifying and analyzing very fine ash particles from these types of eruptions makes it likely that we will be able to pinpoint some of these eruptions, which will allow the sulfate peaks associated with these layers to be positively identified and dated. Volcanic forcing time series developed from earlier South Pole ice cores based on preserved sulfate were crucial for testing climate models, but without tephra analysis, the origin of these layers remains uncertain. <br/><br/>Work on the tephra layers in the South Pole ice core has a number of significant specific objectives, some with practical applications to the basic science goals of Antarctic ice coring, and others that represent independent scientific contributions in their own right. These include: (1) providing independently dated time-intervals in the core, particularly for the deepest ice, (2) quantitatively linking tephra records across Antarctica with the goal of allowing direct and robust climate comparisons between these different parts of the continent, (3) providing information for large local eruptions, that will lead to direct estimates of eruption magnitude and dispersal patterns of Antarctic volcanoes, several of which will likely erupt again. The initial stages of the work will be carried out by identifying silicate-bearing horizons in the ice core, using several methods.  Once found, silicate particles will be imaged so that morphological characteristics of the particles can be used to identify volcanic origin.  Particles identified as tephra will then be chemically analyzed using electron microprobe and laser ablation ICP-MS.  Samples that yield a robust chemical fingerprint will be statistically correlated to known eruptions, and this will be used to address the goals described above.  Broader impacts of this project fall into the areas of education of future generation of researchers, outreach and international cooperation. These activities will continue to promote forward progress in integrating the Antarctic tephra record and more broadly tying it to the global volcanic record."

This has led to increased glacier melt, widespread glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses, and glacier speed-ups. Many of these changes are driven by changing precipitation and increased melt due to warmer air temperatures. This project will use a combination of two models - a regional atmospheric model and a model of processes at the glacier surface - to simulate future changes in temperature and snowfall, and the resulting changes in glacier mass. The combination of models will be tested against the observational record (since 1979 when satellite observations became available), to verify that it can reproduce observed change, and then run to the year 2100. Results will provide better estimates of the impacts of future climate changes over the Antarctic Pensinsula and the expected glacier mass changes driven by the evolving climate. <br/><br/>The project will use the large changes observed on the Peninsula to validate a model framework suitable for understanding the impact of these changes on the glaciers and ice shelves there, with the goal of developing optimally constrained future climate and surface mass change scenarios for the region. The framework will provide both a coherent picture of the impacts of past changes on the region?s ice cover, and also the best available constraints on forcings that will determine ice mass loss from this region going forward under a standard scenario.  The Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) Model will be used over the domain of the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands to quantify trends in spatio-temporal patterns of mass change with a focus on surface melt. The WRF model will be enhanced to account for the specific conditions of glacier surfaces, and the modified model will be used to simulate climate conditions and resulting surface mass budgets and melt over the period 1979-2100. Tying modeled past climate changes to the surface and satellite-based observational record will provide a foundation for interpreting projected future change. Results will be validated using available weather station observations, surface mass-balance data, and satellite-derived records of melt.  The activity will foster partnerships through collaboration with colleagues in Spain, Germany and The Netherlands and will support an early-career postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, introduce undergraduate and high-school students to original research and provide training of students through inclusion of data and results in course curriculums."

However, while there has been constant evolution in the applications that use the Internet, the same is not true of the underlying Internet itself. Instead, the Internet's core service offering has proven tremendously difficult to change and, in fact, has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s. This is problematic because of its impact on the network 'carrier' companies that own and operate the network infrastructure: any upgrade or change in their networks is a tremendously difficult and expensive process, leading to partial and ad-hoc fixes and escalating management costs. The difficulty of effecting change also means that network carriers have been stifled in their ability to explore new services and business models. In short: the long term health of the Internet depends on the health of the carriers that operate its underlying infrastructure, but these carriers are increasingly squeezed between mounting costs and flat revenues. This trajectory is now widely recognized as unsustainable.<br/><br/>The research being undertaken in this project offers a way out of this bind by making efficient software traffic processing a fundamental component of the network infrastructure. Traditionally, network infrastructure has been built from specialized fixed-function hardware which is slow and expensive to evolve. Augmenting this infrastructure with software functions that run on commodity general-purpose hardware, will allow carriers to more easily and cheaply evolve their existing services, as well as to explore innovative new service models. In other words, this project's research will allow network functionality to evolve on (faster) software rather than (slower) hardware development timescales.<br/><br/>Today, the de-facto approach to incorporating advanced traffic-processing functionality into a network is through the deployment of specialized 'middleboxes'. These middleboxes have grown to be a vital part of modern networks but are also widely recognized as bringing with them significant problems including high cost, inflexibility, and complex management.  Recently, advances in software packet processing and virtualization technologies has led industry and research to explore an alternate approach: moving middle- box functionality out of dedicated boxes into software applications that run multiplexed on commodity x86 processors. This approach - termed Network Function Virtualization (NFV) - stands to reshape network infrastructure and bring the benefits of cloud computing to networks. However, the evolution of cloud computing (particularly for data analytics) has greatly benefited from the existence of frameworks that implement application-independent methods for elastic scaling, placement and failover, achieving high efficiency while relieving programmers of these burdens. NFV has no such general management solutions. The central premise of the research agenda being undertaken in this project is that NFV needs a framework, by which we mean a software environment for packet-processing applications that implements general techniques for common functions.<br/><br/>The project addresses fundamental questions that arise when processing network traffic in software. It provides general and effective solutions to the common problems of scaling, performance management, and fault-tolerance for software-based network functions. Moreover, by showing how these solutions can be embedded in a common framework, the research enables faster innovation: third-party vendors can more easily develop new application-relevant functions since they no longer have to deal with the common but thorny issues of availability/scalability/efficiency which are now handled by the framework.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project contributes to the broader goal of ensuring that the Internet continues to serve as the vehicle bringing transformative communication services to the global population. The project's educational component addresses the growing divide between coursework and practice in networked systems through a new undergraduate course that uses the above NFV framework to expose students to modern network software and provide in-depth experience in building and deploying innovative network services. The project is also exploring lab methodologies to scale such project-centric classes to 100+ students. Outreach activities include the creation of an open-source effort in collaboration with network vendors and carriers, and mentoring undergraduates and under-represented students. For this, the PI builds on a strong record of working with industry to impact practice and an exceptional record of building a diverse research group."

Traditional microphysics parameterizations artificially separate ice into categories such as cloud ice, snow, and graupel. These models assume that for each category ice crystal size varies with mass, but they do not account for ice crystal shape evolution. In nature, ice crystal shape, or habit, is temperature dependent and evolves as ice moves through a cloud.  Ice crystal shape significantly affects vapor growth rates by varying the gradients in the encompassing vapor field. Ice crystal shape also influences riming rates and fall speed.  Traditional models are not able to capture this ice crystal shape sensitivity.<br/><br/>This project will study the impact of ice crystal shape evolution on different cloud systems.  Simulations will be conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to look at how ice crystal habit evolution impacts orographic precipitation, tropical cyclone dynamics and precipitation, and squall lines.  A 2-dimensional modeling framework will also be used to explore the effects of evolving ice crystal shape on phase partitioning in mixed-phase clouds.  Finally, how representing lightly-rimed ice crystals, which is now possible by evolving ice crystal shape, impacts mixed-phase cloud stability will be studied.  <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The research provides a unique opportunity to study how ice crystal habit evolution impacts different cloud systems.  At present, the degree to which ice particle shape evolution influences cloud evolution is unknown. With the new microphysics parameterization, the influence evolving ice crystal shape has on cloud system properties can be explored.  How light riming affects mixed-phase clouds can also be examined for the first time.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Modeling ice crystal fall speed evolution which is partially determined by ice crystal shape is crucial for quantitative precipitation forecasts.  Also, cirrus cloud properties and lifetime are incredibly sensitive to ice crystal fall speeds. Cirrus cloud radiative properties depend on ice crystal shape as well, meaning ice crystal shape could have important influences on climate.  Because the microphysical methods in this study can, in principle, be used in any modeling framework, the research has the potential to impact modeling ranging from operational forecasting through climate studies of ice clouds.  Being able to more accurately forecast precipitation, especially heavy or persistent precipitation that could cause flooding in general makes this research relevant to society."

The Condensed Matter and Materials program in the Division of Materials Research also contributes to this award. Understanding the motion of electrons and ions is important for understanding and predicting many phenomena that involve the interaction of matter with light.  These phenomena have both fundamental and technical importance, for example, photovoltaic devices which convert light into electricity, photocatalysis, and control of chemical processes using lasers.   The equation that governs this motion has been known for 90 years.    For all but the simplest systems, however, it is too difficult to solve this equation exactly.  This difficulty arises because of correlated motion. Each electron's motion affects every other electron's motion as well as each ion's, and vice-versa.  Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is an efficient, approximate and popular approach to solving this equation.  In many cases, the particular approximations used today are not adequate, causing unpredictable errors in the electron dynamics.  Maitra and her coworkers develop improved approximations based on rigorous theoretical considerations.  Both undergraduate and graduate students participate in this cutting-edge research.

The dynamics of the electrons and ions are coupled by using a method based on the recently-introduced first-principles exact factorization approach.   This includes developing practical mixed quantum-(semi)classical schemes for correlated electron-ion dynamics that include electronic decoherence and wave packet-branching from first-principles."

To address these challenges, the investigators will use airborne thermal infrared imaging to acquire frequent and detailed tracking of moving flaming fronts for an area of chaparral vegetation in southern California.  The flight lines will be aligned along the direction of the flaming front in the vicinity of the maximum spread zone.  Frequent, sequential images captured along flight lines will enable wind speeds to be estimated through image flow analysis techniques.  Segments of the fire line will be analyzed using spatial statistical and geovisualization methods to empirically establish the relationships between the rate of wildfire spread and characteristics or conditions of the vegetation fuels, terrain, and wind at the landscape scale.  Project benefits to the broader community will include better tools to evaluate fire behavior and better estimates of the response of wildfires to fuel conditions and treatments."

Localized upwelling of hot mantle known as ""mantle plumes"" successfully explains locations like Hawaii and Yellowstone. However, there are many other sites worldwide like Cape Verde and the Canaries islands that require further research to understand the mechanisms behind volcanic activity. The team's goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that produce volcanoes away from plate margins using a collaborative approach that combines data from geochemical and geodynamical studies. The investigators, including international collaborators, will collect new geochemical data including volatiles (C, H, S, etc.) from Cape Verde and the Canaries, using these locations as natural laboratories to study the deep Earth. They will use melt inclusions contained within the host crystals to collect volatile data to answer the proposed fundamental questions. These results can also be incorporated in assessment of volcanic hazards. Additionally, they will provide new CO2 and H2O data that will help constrain volatile output for intraplate magmatism, and especially increase our understanding of the deep Earth carbon cycle. The results from this project will flow directly into the teaching of the principal investigator, and will be disseminated to a broad audience through outreach activities at the Geosciences Museum at Virginia Tech, the Virginia Science Festival, and through different media sources to the public.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to integrate petrological and geochemical data from Cape Verde and the Canaries with geodynamic models to broaden our understanding of the composition and dynamical processes in the mantle that can give rise to intraplate magmatism. The mantle plume model has generally been accepted as a plausible mechanism for intraplate volcanism, but not all locations that are considered ""hotspots"" have the seismic and geochemical signatures to back up a deep-rooted source. Small-scale convection (e.g., edge-driven convection, EDC) has been proposed as an alternative mechanism for a subset of near continent locations. The investigators propose to test mantle plume vs. EDC as mechanisms for intraplate volcanism using Cape Verde and the Canaries as natural laboratories. These locations were selected for their position near a continental margin but away from plate boundaries, making them ideal to test our working hypotheses. Also, these locations provide easy access to abundant primitive tephras to be used for melt-inclusion studies and volatile determinations, which are necessary for an improved determination of melting conditions. Finally, Cape Verde and the Canaries are the only two oceanic settings where carbonatites have been reported. Preliminary work on Cape Verde and the Canaries suggest that some samples (including the carbonatites) from these locations melted from a carbonated mantle source, indicating the importance of intraplate volcanism for mantle outgassing, a missing link in the deep global water and carbon cycles. Thereby, the team will address these fundamental questions: 1) How do the dynamics of mantle upwelling control the melting behavior of the source through the effects of temperature and upwelling rate? 2) What is the source composition of these Atlantic hotspots, and how does it affect the dynamics of mantle upwelling as well as petrological determinations of source temperatures, the size of the swell and the seismic expression of mantle upwelling? 3) What are the volatile budgets of intraplate magmas and their role in the global water and carbon cycles, and how do volatiles modulate mantle dynamics by reducing viscosity? 4) What are the diagnostic geochemical and petrological signatures of the plume model vs. EDC?"

These micro-scale devices are important elements in many consumer electronics and products including wireless telephones, automobiles, and entertainment devices. The capabilities of these systems are often limited by a number of factors that restrict their range of operation, such as their maximum amplitude of vibration.  This research pursues a fundamental understanding of these limitations and developing systematic tools for improving the performance of these devices.  The broader impact of this project includes outreach, mentoring and training, inclusion of students from underrepresented groups, development of classroom materials motivated by the research, and dissemination of results.  This project will result in multidisciplinary training of students, who benefit from the close collaboration and integrated theoretical and experimental research approach of the PIs.   Also, the PIs and their graduate students will continue their longstanding participation in summer outreach programs to middle- and high-school students, and the inclusion of undergraduate research assistants. The PIs also plan to create an alumni mentoring program for graduate students, in which current graduate students will be connected with alumni who will offer professional advice and support.<br/><br/>Most commercial devices that employ vibratory MEMS are designed so that the resonant elements operate in their linear range and the designer can rely on simple models to analyze their response.  However, this sets limits on their operating range that do not take full advantage of their potential.  There have been recent efforts demonstrating significantly improved performance when nonlinear effects are systematically included in the MEMS design process.  The focus of this project is to embrace nonlinear behavior in resonators, to develop an understanding of the attendant limits, and to develop and experimentally demonstrate design methods that allow one to optimize performance in this realm.  The research focus is on MEMS that operate with one or two fundamental vibratory modes that can be described by weakly nonlinear models so that analytical methods, namely perturbation techniques, and the theory of normal forms, are applicable.  These models are linked with multi-physics computational tools and optimization techniques, using normal forms to formulate objective functions for the applications of interest.  Devices developed with these tools will be fabricated, characterized, and tested to validate the approach.  Applications will include frequency generation, frequency conversion, and inertial sensing."

Communication among cells is critical for most, if not all, living systems and regulates processes including cell migration, cell division, growth, and death. One way this occurs is though a process called endocytosis whereby molecules are transported into the cell. Endocytosis requires an intricate coordination of proteins inside the cell as well as physical changes to the surface of the cell. The deformation of the cell's surface is central to endocytosis, yet there are few tools that can dissect these physical changes that are necessary for endocytosis. One reason this is difficult to study is that this processes is dynamic and occurs on the nanoscale, beyond the resolution of traditional microscopy. This project will advance the study of nanometer scale cell surface dynamics by developing and applying new methods to measure and manipulate the process of endocytosis in living cells. Many biological processes occur on this scale, and the methods developed in this research will be widely applicable across a range of biological systems including virus entry and budding, cell migration, and neurobiology.  In addition to contributing to understanding cellular processes, the effort will include training students from K-12 through graduate school on microscopy and the value of multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding cellular processes. <br/>The goal of this research is to understand the dynamics of endocytic vesicle assembly and the interconnected roles played by the proteins involved, as well as the physical changes to plasma membrane shape. A recently developed fluorescence microscopy technique is uniquely suited to imaging nanometer dynamics of vesicle formation in real-time in living cells. In Aim 1 the novel microscopy technique is used to measure endocytic pit formation dynamics upon stimulation with EGF. This experimental platform will then be used to dissect the protein dynamics during pit formation, mapping the correlation between protein dynamics and plasma membrane morphology (Aim 2). Finally, a strategy will be developed to physically stall endocytosis utilizing a tethered ligand. This platform will be used to explore curvature sensing and curvature inducing proteins (Aim 3). This research will yield a quantitative description of ligand internalization dynamics and the interplay between protein recruitment and membrane morphology on a millisecond time scale. Completion of this research will shed light on previously undiscovered mechanisms of plasma membrane dynamics and signaling that may revolutionize the way cellular communication is understood. Further, it will provide new tools to broadly improve the understanding of plasma membrane dynamics in cell signaling and homeostasis.  In addition to providing K-12 though graduate students with a rich educational experience, the PI will make available to the community any software that is produced and which is useful to others in achieving high resolution data.<br/>This award is supported jointly by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics"

However, reconstructing the genetic mechanisms explaining precisely the experimentally observed patterns and, more importantly, the morphological outcomes in terms of shape and forms, is an extraordinarily difficult task for human scientists due to the complex regulatory networks and dynamics characteristic of biological processes. This project will produce and use novel computational tools to aid in the discovery of dynamic predictive models explaining at once the exponentially growing experimental datasets of morphogenetic shapes, forms, and patterns. The interdisciplinary characteristic of this project will foster new links between computational and biological sciences, resulting in fundamental changes in the research methodology in these fields that will lead to an acceleration of novel applications in developmental and regenerative medicine. The computational tools developed in this work will also serve as educational advances for the teaching of dynamic regulation and systems theory in biology, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Importantly, this project will involve graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. This work will be performed at UMBC, which has traditionally served large minority communities, and this project will advance the participation of these communities in the fast-paced field of computational biology.<br/><br/>This research will develop the necessary set of computational algorithms and tools that will readily assist scientists in the discovery of the genetic mechanisms controlling the development of biological shapes, forms, and patterns.

The project will be grounded on mathematical models of partial differential equations, which will leverage our understanding of biological mechanisms of morphogenesis using the theory of dynamical systems. Furthermore, these novel computational tools will allow us to streamline the building of predictive, dynamic models of morphogenesis, explain the ever-increasing large dataset of morphogenetic experiments being laboriously produced by the community, and advance many fields of biology and engineering."

The study of the resulting streams of data currently requires extensive expertise and often utilizes methods that are not guaranteed to be optimal. This leads to an overly qualitative analysis that can miss a significant portion of the information hidden within the signal. This project aims to utilize and advance tools from topological data analysis, an emergent field focused on providing quantitative measurements of the shape of data, and to elucidate invisible features and structure of signals which current methods cannot detect.  Therefore, the resulting framework will be able to provide insight into the systems that generated the data while providing a strong mathematical footing for automating the analysis of systems and processes. The knowledge gained from the work will benefit a wide variety of scientific fields where analysis from sensor feedback signals is needed such as additive manufacturing and smart drug delivery systems. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this project will offer students rich opportunities for collaboration and cross-training in a variety of areas in engineering, applied math, and signal analysis. The PIs will also continue and expand their efforts to identify and recruit graduate students from under-represented groups with relevant interests by working with the Association for Women in Mathematics and the Society for Women Engineers.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort that seeks to investigate an innovative framework for time series analysis through advancing and linking signal processing, dynamical systems, and topological data analysis. The research team will pursue a topological approach that utilizes the recently developed persistent homology to study the time series of dynamical systems. Specifically, they will (1) derive a solid mathematical foundation based on applied topology which enables a more robust and quantitative investigation of dynamical systems, (2) research innovative methods for studying the topology of the underlying manifold in dynamical systems from collected time series using topological data analysis, and (3) demonstrate and assess the validity of the theoretical results using numerical and physical experiments. The theoretical underpinning of the research is especially suitable for detecting and describing dynamical signatures such as underlying attractors, chaos, and self-similarity using lower dimensional descriptors, rather than lower dimensional representation. Therefore, this work is capable of providing a new perspective into our understanding of time series analysis particularly for dynamical systems with complex behavior."

This question is at the heart of evolutionary ecology, but has been very difficult to answer. A major problem is that current analytical approaches, known as phylogenetic comparative methods, require that a single value be used to represent a trait for an entire species. As a result, valuable information on differences among individuals within a species can't be used. This limits the types of questions that these comparative methods can address. The main goal of this project is to develop new analytical software that accounts for trait variation within species, which will result in a much more powerful computational tool. The newly developed software will be tested using experimental data from salamanders and fish. This award will have multiple broader impacts. This new tool will let a whole new set of hypotheses be tested and will be widely used by scientists doing evolutionary ecology research. Undergraduate students will receive hands-on training in mathematical modeling and software development. Educational outreach activities include a research-education exchange between a regional undergraduate university and a large research university. National and international teaching workshops will help train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world.<br/><br/>Analyses of phenotypic data tend to remain distinctly different enterprises between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies. Consequently, we still do not know how microevolutionary trends from ecological selection associate to macroevolutionary trends across phylogenies. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) measure the amount of phylogenetic signal in a set of data or account for the phylogenetic relatedness among observations when evaluating ecological variation, but currently work only with single values for species. Thus, large amounts of within-species data are disregarded when using PCMs, which limits their inferential capability. This project will develop an analytical solution to this problem, and provide a framework for extending PCMs to large data sets comprising microevolutionary data. The methods developed will allow scientists to evaluate the consistency of small-scale and large scale evolutionary relationships in a comparative framework. This project will incorporate both theoretical and empirical components.  Statistical research will evaluate the statistical power and inferential error rates of ""expanded-PCM"" to varied analytical designs, phenotypic variables, tree topologies, and data balance. These methods will be applied empirically to two vertebrate systems to study the phylogenetic relatedness of intra-species morphological variation, as it is associated with intra- and interspecific ecological variation. Several educational outreach activities will also be conducted, including: a research-in-education exchange between a primarily undergraduate university and large research university, and teaching workshops in quantitative methods to train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world."

Taking part in the workshop will be faculty from UH and other 2-year and 4-year-colleges in Hawaii and across the central Pacific Ocean, undergraduate advisors who are experienced in guiding Pacific Islanders into STEM studies and careers, and recent graduates of the University of Hawaii who have achieved STEM-relevant careers. Two professionals from the University of California with expertise in expanding diversity in education will provide a context for underrepresentation of groups in STEM. It is anticipated that solutions may differ because of cultural differences between island groups, so sufficient time will be given for discussions that reveal such differences. At the end of the workshop, an annotated document that summarizes recommendations for reducing barriers to STEM education and careers for Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders will be assembled for dissemination via websites and a journal focusing on such issues. It is anticipated that such document will be useful to faculty who mentor Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in STEM, specifically those in the biosciences.<br/><br/>Training Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in STEM fields will allow them to actively engage in devising solutions to the many problems faced by the islanders due to climate change.

These micro-scale devices are important elements in many consumer electronics and products including wireless telephones, automobiles, and entertainment devices. The capabilities of these systems are often limited by a number of factors that restrict their range of operation, such as their maximum amplitude of vibration.  This research pursues a fundamental understanding of these limitations and developing systematic tools for improving the performance of these devices.  The broader impact of this project includes outreach, mentoring and training, inclusion of students from underrepresented groups, development of classroom materials motivated by the research, and dissemination of results.  This project will result in multidisciplinary training of students, who benefit from the close collaboration and integrated theoretical and experimental research approach of the PIs.   Also, the PIs and their graduate students will continue their longstanding participation in summer outreach programs to middle- and high-school students, and the inclusion of undergraduate research assistants. The PIs also plan to create an alumni mentoring program for graduate students, in which current graduate students will be connected with alumni who will offer professional advice and support.<br/><br/>Most commercial devices that employ vibratory MEMS are designed so that the resonant elements operate in their linear range and the designer can rely on simple models to analyze their response.

The focus of this project is to embrace nonlinear behavior in resonators, to develop an understanding of the attendant limits, and to develop and experimentally demonstrate design methods that allow one to optimize performance in this realm.  The research focus is on MEMS that operate with one or two fundamental vibratory modes that can be described by weakly nonlinear models so that analytical methods, namely perturbation techniques, and the theory of normal forms, are applicable.  These models are linked with multi-physics computational tools and optimization techniques, using normal forms to formulate objective functions for the applications of interest.

The structure and intensity of turbulent mixing in the surface layer of the ocean vary greatly in the presence of steep wind waves, and existing numerical models are not always very accurate in their predictions. This study seeks to improve the representation of surface wave effects in numerical models of upper-ocean mixing and expand the empirical basis for validating these models against mixed layer turbulence measurements. Existing data from freely drifting instruments that move up and down the well mixed layer of the upper ocean will be analyzed to yield new information about the vertical structure of turbulence under a wide range of wave conditions. Virtual drifters simulated in very high resolution numerical models will be used to develop new analysis methods and to enhance the limited observational data sets. The study will aid comparisons among competing theories on wave-turbulence interaction by expanding and refining the metrics of model-data comparisons.  Insights on wave-turbulence interaction will lead to new mixing parameterizations, that can be validated against small-scale turbulence measurements, and ultimately enhance the skill of ocean circulation models. The dissemination of drifter measurements and model code will also benefit other approaches to parameterizing wave effects.  The ability of the improved closure models to reproduce the observed anisotropy of mixed layer turbulence, and the homogeneity of momentum and scalar profiles, will be of interest in many physical and biogeochemical oceanographic fields, ranging from climate modeling to coastal sediment transport and oil spill prediction. Implementing the improvements in a widely used modeling framework, the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) will facilitate usage of these results by a broad range of ocean modelers. This project will promote study at a unique nexus between engineering and geophysics and supports a graduate research associate to work on drifter data analysis and model-data comparisons.

The CL forcing Reynolds stress terms and new turbulence closures will be applied to modify the larger class of 'weak-equilibrium' SMCs for Langmuir turbulence. These will be implemented and evaluated in the GOTM framework, including the modeled interaction of Langmuir turbulence and surface wave breaking. New analysis of existing high-quality Lagrangian float data will provide profiles of kinetic energy components, turbulent length scales, large-eddy kinetic energy dissipation rates and near-surface Lagrangian statistics that can discriminate between theories for surface -wave forcing of boundary-layer turbulence. New large eddy simulations (LES) will contain embedded virtual floats, and will include forcing by stochastic wave breaking at float- and model-resolved scales. Using this LES, the researchers will develop new data analysis methods and guide SMC modifications for wave forcing. The new near-surface closure for CL forcing will be combined with similar treatments of buoyant production in of turbulent covariance in SMC for convection with nonlocal gradient closures. LES results and float data will be used to verify and tune SMC models. Modified SMC model code and float data test cases will be distributed for public availability via the GOTM framework."

ALMA has already demonstrated its revolutionary impact with its dramatic images of planet, star and galaxy formation. These results will accelerate as the full array becomes operational, and with the longest baselines ALMA will achieve an angular resolution of tens of milli-arseconds. ALMA provides one to two orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous facilities in all areas of millimeter- and submillimeter-wave observations, including sensitivity, angular resolution and image fidelity.<br/><br/>NRAO will design and produce ALMA Band 1 (35-50 GHz) low noise amplifiers and associated test and support equipment.

Garcia-Garibay of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California-Los Angeles is establishing new synthetic strategies to transform simple chemicals into more complex, high value substances, by taking advantage of reactions that occur under the high order and rigidity of the crystalline state.  Their strategy relies on the selection of structures that are known to form highly reactive intermediates when activated by the absorption of ultraviolet light.  By executing those reactions in the crystalline state, instead of doing them in liquids, they are able to obtain nearly pure solid products with no need for solvents, catalysts or additional reagents. This project is in the SusChEM portfolio as the reactions do not use solvent and require no energy for the separation and removal of byproducts.  This project provides an excellent multidisciplinary training ground for several students.  Graduate students and summer undergraduates from three partnering Historically Black Colleges and Universities institutions: Howard University, Clark Atlanta University, and Spellman College, are involved.     <br/><br/>Having implemented robust strategies to engineer reactions in crystals by selecting stable molecules that generate highly reactive intermediates, this project addresses the solid state photodecarbonylation of hexasubstituted ketones and the photodenitrogenation of triazolines, pyrazolines, and selected aromatic azides.  Radical pairs, biradicals, and nitrenes are generated in the crystalline state in highly exothermic processes from the excited state of the reactants, and their product formation and kinetics are analyzed in detail. In the solid state, radical-radical combination reactions with retention of stereochemistry, and selective nitrene insertions occur.  Photochemical reactions are carried out in well-characterized crystalline phases and their transformations from the solid phase of the reactant to the solid phase of the product are analyzed by thermal analysis and spectroscopic means.  This characterization is done in order to determine the corresponding phase diagrams and the conditions required for clean and efficient reactions.  Detailed reaction mechanisms are explored by taking advantage of structural information available from single crystals X-ray diffraction and kinetic measurements obtained from laser flash photolysis measurements using nanocrystals suspended in water."

However, at each of these levels, there are some individuals who cheat and others who do not, and biologists still do not fully understand how populations evolve stable systems with both types of individuals or how this coevolution is distributed across populations of the same species in nature. This is because individuals who cheat gain the benefits of cooperation without paying their fair share of the cost, and thus this should spread rapidly through populations. Studying the natural distributions of cheating and cooperation in populations is important because cheating is prevalent in the natural world and occurs across all levels of biological organization, from genes that enhance their own transmission to the detriment of the individual that harbors them, to brood parasites that trick others into raising their young. More importantly, the evolution of mechanisms to prevent cheating was likely critical to the emergence of biological complexity. Moreover, cheating can influence everything from the success of symbioses to the emergence of cancer, and thus has important applications to both medicine and agriculture. The novelty of this project is that the researchers will document natural populations of a slime mold in the wild to determine if there is variation (and coevolution) in the degree of cheating and in resistance to cheating across space and through time. The research also takes a population genomic approach to determine the genes involved in cheating and resistance. Overall the goal is to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes influencing the dynamics of cheating in nature. <br/><br/>One prominent hypothesis is that cheating selects for mechanisms to resist or suppress it, which in turn selects for mechanisms to overcome that resistance. Cheating might thus give rise to an arms race of adaptations and counter-adaptations. If so, then social conflict, just like other forms of selective conflict, may cause rapid, divergent, and never-ending change, driving evolutionary divergence and diversification. To date, this arms race hypothesis has garnered support from laboratory experiments and molecular evolution analyses, but there is no work examining how cheating impacts the evolutionary trajectories of social traits in nature. The goal of this research is to test several predictions of this hypothesis in natural populations of the social amoeba (or cellular slime mold) Dictyostelium discoideum. This organism has an unusual form of multicellularity that renders it particularly vulnerable to cheating. The research will quantify phenotypic patterns of adaptation and counter-adaptation in nature, inspired by approaches used to elucidate other forms of selective conflict, such as host-pathogen or genetic conflict. Longitudinal sampling across space and time, combined with the ability to save and revive past and future social partners, offers a unique opportunity to observe coevolution in situ and constitutes a major advantage over other model systems."

This general class of system arises in many applications of interest to society, including water infiltration from the Earth's surface, carbon sequestration, gas production from hydraulically fractured wells, petroleum recovery, land-atmosphere interaction, engineered treatment processes, and a wide range of biomedical applications (e.g. tumor growth, dermal transport, etc.). Our scientific understanding of porous medium systems is embodied in mechanistic mathematical models, which are used to evaluate such porous medium systems, make predictions, guide engineering design, and to inform policy decisions. Because the length of many porous medium systems is much greater than the natural length scale of the solid phase, the mathematical models intended to represent such systems are typically posed at a scale that neglects many aspects of the physical processes known to influence flow in such systems. While the physics are relatively well understood at the small scale, there has not existed a rigorous connection between the small, well-understood scale and the larger scale where problems must be solved. Recently, a theory has been developed that connects these two length scales and yields models that have the promise to be more physically realistic and accurate than the standard models used in practice. This research will reduce these new theoretical models to completely solvable forms, evaluate specific aspects of these models, and validate the models for a range of systems. Both small scale experiments and high-resolution modeling will be a used to accomplish these objectives. The results will be of widespread benefit to society because of the broad applicability of this class of problem, and the work will involve graduate students recruited from a pool that is rich in under-represented fractions of the population working in scientific research. <br/><br/>Many critical problems in hydrology involve two-fluid-phase flow in porous medium systems. The proposed work will connect well-understood microscale processes with macroscale models using the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) that will yield closed, solved models that are evaluated and validated.  Microfluidic experiments, and high resolution lattice Boltzmann simulations will be used to provide the fine scale detail needed to construct specific forms of closure relationships and support a thorough evaluation and validation of this new class of model. Computational and experimental methods and results will also be produced that will be of value independent of the theoretical manner in which macroscale systems are modeled. This work will have a significant set of broader impacts. The models developed are hydrologically motivated but have applicability far beyond hydrology. We will nurture and grow our set of collaborators that apply TCAT-based models for applications such as tumor growth, the effects of diabetes on extremal tissue, and engineered systems such as ultrafiltration membranes. The lattice-Boltzmann methods developed will be applicable to a wide range of systems beyond the hydrologic systems of focus in this work. A second edition of a book describing the theoretical advances will be produced to disseminate the findings of this work. Additional impacts include: (1) contributions to education through course content, student research, and science outreach; (2) participation of underrepresented researchers and linkages to minority recruitment programs; (3) broad dissemination of findings in hydrology, physics, engineering, and applied mathematics journals; and (4) digital archiving and dissemination of unique data sets and video images of experiments and high-resolution simulations."

BMGs are novel metallic materials that are fundamentally different from, and advantageous to conventional alloys. They are stronger than most crystalline metals, but at the same time shapeable like plastics. Additional benefits of BMGs include extremely high precision of parts, increased complexity and elimination of expensive machining. Use of BMGs will provide broad opportunities for manufacturers in areas such as watch making and precision mechanics, electronics, biomedical, nano-imprint, defense, aerospace, and automotive. The current barrier to industrializing BMGs is non-availability of practical feedstock material such as BMG sheets. Technologies that we are developing as part of this project include BMG sheet fabrication and thermoplastic forming (TPF) of final components for a variety of applications. Using sheets, manufacturers can leverage BMGs unique processability to fabricate complex shapes at highest precision and ease through thermoplastic forming methods. Our technology also has significant societal implications. It will empower innovative small and medium size U.S. companies by bringing them a novel manufacturing technology that is highly versatile, energy efficient and low in capital investment. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project is based on the recent scientific discovery of BMG sheet fabrication using the thermoplastic forming technology. This is a low-force, high-rate deformation method with great potential for large-scale commercial manufacturing. We expect that our findings will lead to a better understanding of TPF-based processes. Specifically, for multi-step TPF-based sheet fabrication, the proposed work will reveal process stability and how it is affected by processing parameters. Proposed research will also determine the effects of TPF-based processing on mechanical properties of BMGs, will help identify suitable BMG alloys for sheet fabrication and provide insights into their commercial feasibility. In addition, the proposed work will also enhance theoretical understanding of BMG sheet fabrication and help develop a predictable and quantitative model description. Such models can allow prediction of alloy-specific processing conditions in industrial settings in the future. Finally, this project will result in a commercially viable sheet fabrication process and apparatus for BMG sheets of unprecedented sizes. It will significantly advance opportunities for bulk metallic glasses in a wide range of applications, bringing two decades of academic discoveries to the commercial arena."

The geologic record of Earth's past offers a glimpse of what could be in store for the future.  Research by Ivany and her team looks to Antarctica during a time of past global warmth to see how seasonality of temperature and rainfall in coastal settings are likely to change in the future.  They will use the chemistry of fossils (a natural archive of these variables) to test a provocative hypothesis about near-monsoonal conditions in the high latitudes when the oceans are warm.  If true, we can expect high-latitude shipping lanes to become more hazardous and fragile marine ecosystems adapted to constant cold temperatures to suffer.  With growing information about how human activities are likely to affect the planet in the future, we will be able to make more informed decisions about policies today. This research involves an international team of scholars, including several women scientists, training of graduate students, and a public museum exhibit to educate children about how we study Earth's ancient climate and what we can learn from it.<br/><br/>Antarctica is key to an understanding how Earth?s climate system works under conditions of elevated CO2. The poles are the most sensitive regions on the planet to climate change, and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and the degree to which high-latitude warming is amplified are important components for climate models to capture. Accurate proxy data with good age control are therefore critical for testing numerical models and establishing global patterns. The La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island is the only documented marine section from the globally warm Eocene Epoch exposed in outcrop on the continent; hence its climate record is integral to studies of warming. Early data suggest the potential for strongly seasonal precipitation and runoff in coastal settings.  This collaboration among paleontologists, geochemists, and climate modelers will test this using seasonally resolved del-18O data from fossil shallow marine bivalves to track the evolution of seasonality through the section, in combination with independent proxies for the composition of summer precipitation (leaf wax del-D) and local seawater (clumped isotopes).  The impact of the anticipated salinity stratification on regional climate will be evaluated in the context of numerical climate model simulations.  In addition to providing greater clarity on high-latitude conditions during this time of high CO2, the combination of proxy and model results will provide insights about how Eocene warmth may have been maintained and how subsequent cooling came about. As well, a new approach to the analysis of shell carbonates for 87Sr/86Sr will allow refinements in age control so as to allow correlation of this important section with other regions to clarify global climate gradients.  The project outlined here will develop new and detailed paleoclimate records from existing samples using well-tuned as well as newer proxies applied here in novel ways. Seasonal extremes are climate parameters generally inaccessible to most studies but critical to an understanding of climate change; these are possible to resolve in this well-preserved, accretionary-macrofossil-bearing section. This is an integrated study that links marine and terrestrial climate records for a key region of the planet across the most significant climate transition in the Cenozoic."

The knowledge gained from the work will benefit a wide variety of scientific fields where analysis from sensor feedback signals is needed such as additive manufacturing and smart drug delivery systems. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this project will offer students rich opportunities for collaboration and cross-training in a variety of areas in engineering, applied math, and signal analysis. The PIs will also continue and expand their efforts to identify and recruit graduate students from under-represented groups with relevant interests by working with the Association for Women in Mathematics and the Society for Women Engineers.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort that seeks to investigate an innovative framework for time series analysis through advancing and linking signal processing, dynamical systems, and topological data analysis. The research team will pursue a topological approach that utilizes the recently developed persistent homology to study the time series of dynamical systems. Specifically, they will (1) derive a solid mathematical foundation based on applied topology which enables a more robust and quantitative investigation of dynamical systems, (2) research innovative methods for studying the topology of the underlying manifold in dynamical systems from collected time series using topological data analysis, and (3) demonstrate and assess the validity of the theoretical results using numerical and physical experiments. The theoretical underpinning of the research is especially suitable for detecting and describing dynamical signatures such as underlying attractors, chaos, and self-similarity using lower dimensional descriptors, rather than lower dimensional representation. Therefore, this work is capable of providing a new perspective into our understanding of time series analysis particularly for dynamical systems with complex behavior."

Computer models of ice sheet behavior are central to addressing this challenge. In this project we will test and improve ice sheet models by comparing model predictions of past ice extent to the geologic record in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica.  This innovative project will collect key geologic data from mountains called nunataks that extend above current and former ice levels that can be used as ""dipsticks"" to reconstruct changes in ice elevation that will be used to improve the models.  The end result will be both much better knowledge of past three-dimensional changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and improved models that allow for more accurate simulations of potential future changes in the ice sheet. <br/><br/>This research will fill critical gaps in the geologic record of the pattern and timing of vertical changes in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in western Dronning Maud Land, by focusing on areas that are critical for differentiating between possible models of past ice sheet configuration. Reconstruction of ice-sheet surface changes will involve mapping and cosmogenic nuclide dating of glacially sculpted bedrock, ice-marginal moraines, and erratic boulders at different elevations on nunataks. Patterns of 10Be, 26Al, 14C, and 21Ne concentrations and ratios will enable inferences about the timing and magnitude of changes in maximum ice surface elevations and periods of burial by non-erosive (cold-based) ice. Results will be integrated with data from other areas to provide insight into changes across the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet, and into the role of large ice sheets in climate evolution and global sea level changes. The field-based results will provide constraints against which predictive ice sheet models will be tested and improved, contributing to glaciology, climate and Quaternary science. Broader impacts of this study will also advance the development of the next generation of STEM students and polar scientists. While gaining experience in international collaboration, field and laboratory methods, data analysis, and modeling, two graduate students will work with teachers to develop, implement, and disseminate standards-based lesson plans for student activities linking this research to learning objectives for middle school science."

The project aims to enhance the capabilities of such a group of robots by integrating Compressive Sensing for data compression. Compressive sensing enables robots to quickly extract information from their environment, efficiently communicate that information to each other over a wireless network, and intelligently direct their motion to obtain relevant sensing data in the future.  Significant theoretical and technical challenges must be addressed in this project to realize the potential of a compressive robotic sensing system.  The project will demonstrate results in two specific applications, (i) driving a group of aerial robots to monitor their environment, (ii) driving robotic micro-probes to measure processes inside a living cell.  The project also seeks to disseminate its findings through educational and outreach activities.  Results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in control theory at both Boston University and Stanford University.  The researchers will also work with high school students and undergraduates through research mentorship programs and through lab demonstrations for visitors.<br/><br/>The fundamental goal of the project is to create rigorously analyzed algorithms that take advantage of sparse signal descriptions to create efficient motion plans for a team of sensing robots that monitor the environment.  The driving hypothesis is that sparsity can greatly extend the performance of robotic sensing systems by saving battery power, computation, storage, and communication bandwidth---all critically limited resources for robotic platforms.  The research team will take a Bayesian approach to Compressive Sensing, which allows for sensing quality to be quantified with information theoretic metrics such as entropy.  A receding horizon control approach will be developed for driving robotic sensors to collect the most valuable sensor data, in order to reconstruct a sparse representation of their environment using Compressive Sensing.  Such control strategies will be adapted to both static and dynamic environments, and both centralized and distributed solutions will be sought. The concepts developed in this project will be applied to two specific sensing domains: (i) networks of quadrotor sensing robots sensing environmental data and (ii) confocal fluorescence microscopy for three-dimensional imaging of dynamics in bio-molecular systems. These two application domains have radically different length and time scales, dynamical properties, and information content. A successful application of the ideas developed in this project to both these domains will prove the generality of the Compressive Robotic Sensing System concept."

The literature in social psychology suggests that human social cognition is fraught with a host of cognitive and motivational biases that are difficult to explain within a coherent theoretical framework. In contrast, research in other fields studying human social behavior as well as some studies in the area of social cognition suggest that people are well attuned to their immediate social environments and that apparent biases may be caused by methodological problems.  The data collected in this pilot project will inform this debate and help researchers from psychology, sociology, computational social science, and other fields build more coherent models of cognitive processes underlying social judgments.  Many public educational programs rely on spread of knowledge and behaviors through people's networks.  Project findings regarding the accuracy of human social judgments will have implications for those programs.  The data will be archived in the public repository Open Science Collaboration.<br/><br/>This research project will test the feasibility of building an innovative methodological tool called the social circle panel to study the accuracy of people's judgments about the presence of different beliefs and behaviors in their social environments.  Social circles will be defined by the frequency of contact.  The online panel will aim to include participants with diverse sociodemographic characteristics as well as members of their social circles or personal networks. The panel will enable both the elicitation of subjective judgments of beliefs and behaviors in individuals' social circles, and the evaluation of those judgments against objective data collected from the members of their social circles.  It also will enable measurement of the stability of people's judgments over time and the investigation of whether changes in one's social circle are reflected in one's judgments.  Building the panel will require dealing with a number of methodological challenges ranging from biased samples to panel contamination.  The data produced by this pilot study will be useful for researchers who wish to use similar tools to understand cognitive processes underlying network effects."

Nowhere have the changes been more pronounced, nor happened as quickly, as in the Arctic Ocean. Pack-ice is melting, water is warming, storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and basic circulation patterns are being altered. Our project focuses on the fate of the Pacific water that enters the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait. Pacific water plays a critical role in the western Arctic ecosystem. In wintertime the cold inflowing water provides nutrients that spur the growth of phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. In summertime, the warm water melts pack ice and provides freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. After the water crosses the Chukchi Sea, north of Bering Strait, some of it forms a narrow current at the edge of the shelf and flows eastward. As part of our project we will continue to maintain a mooring positioned in the center of the current to measure its physical and biological properties. The mooring has been deployed (with a few gaps) since 2002, and during this time it has measured striking changes that need to be placed in the context of the evolving Arctic system. In addition, we will carry out shipboard surveys of the current and adjacent waters when we service the mooring, to provide a larger-scale view of the fate of the Pacific water.<br/>  <br/>The monitoring mooring is situated at 152oW near the Beaufort Sea shelf break, roughly 150 km downstream of Pt. Barrow. It will be deployed for two years from fall 2016 to fall 2018. This will extend the time series at this location to 13 years. The mooring records the velocity of the water column and pack ice using two ADCPs, and measures temperature, salinity, and pressure using a series of MicroCats spaced along the wire. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate will be measured at 35 m (at the top float of the mooring), and a passive acoustic recorder situated near the base of the mooring will record marine mammal calls. Zooplankton concentration will be estimated using the ADCP backscatter data. Among other things, this will allow us to determine how much water, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, and freshwater are transported by the current, and, importantly, assess how much exchange occurs between the interior of the Arctic Ocean and the boundary waters. Upwelling occurs during all seasons along the Beaufort slope, and it appears to be increasing as the climate warms. The mooring is ideally suited to quantify the upwelling, as well any downwelling that occurs. The shipboard sampling will include sampling of some of the Distributed Biological Observatory transects, which will contribute to those ongoing time series."

This has led to increased glacier melt, widespread glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses, and glacier speed-ups. Many of these changes are driven by changing precipitation and increased melt due to warmer air temperatures. This project will use a combination of two models - a regional atmospheric model and a model of processes at the glacier surface - to simulate future changes in temperature and snowfall, and the resulting changes in glacier mass. The combination of models will be tested against the observational record (since 1979 when satellite observations became available), to verify that it can reproduce observed change, and then run to the year 2100. Results will provide better estimates of the impacts of future climate changes over the Antarctic Pensinsula and the expected glacier mass changes driven by the evolving climate. <br/><br/>The project will use the large changes observed on the Peninsula to validate a model framework suitable for understanding the impact of these changes on the glaciers and ice shelves there, with the goal of developing optimally constrained future climate and surface mass change scenarios for the region. The framework will provide both a coherent picture of the impacts of past changes on the region's ice cover, and also the best available constraints on forcings that will determine ice mass loss from this region going forward under a standard scenario.  The Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) Model will be used over the domain of the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands to quantify trends in spatio-temporal patterns of mass change with a focus on surface melt. The WRF model will be enhanced to account for the specific conditions of glacier surfaces, and the modified model will be used to simulate climate conditions and resulting surface mass budgets and melt over the period 1979-2100. Tying modeled past climate changes to the surface and satellite-based observational record will provide a foundation for interpreting projected future change. Results will be validated using available weather station observations, surface mass-balance data, and satellite-derived records of melt.  The activity will foster partnerships through collaboration with colleagues in Spain, Germany and The Netherlands and will support an early-career postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, introduce undergraduate and high-school students to original research and provide training of students through inclusion of data and results in course curriculums."

This topography reflects the many episodes of continental collision, breakup, and modification that the land mass has experienced over billions of years. The movements of the tectonic plates at Earth?s surface are inextricably linked to the movement of rocks in Earth?s mantle (mantle convection). Understanding the connection between the Earth?s interior and surface is essential to addressing fundamental questions about how continents are created, how they evolve over time, and how they are destroyed. This study will use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to image the properties of the crust and mantle beneath North America, with particular emphasis on imaging in three dimensions the energy loss (attenuation) experienced by seismic waves. While it is generally acknowledged that seismic attenuation has the potential to be a valuable source of information about the Earth?s interior, it is difficult to isolate attenuation from other wave-propagation phenomena, which has historically limited its use by researchers. Integrated research and education activities will utilize data recorded by the NSF EarthScope USArray seismometers, which have recorded what is likely the best data set in existence to confront these challenges.<br/><br/>This project will investigate, using new data analysis and seismic-wavefield simulations, the three-dimensional variations in shear attenuation beneath North America. This study will also develop a 3-D model of shear velocity in the upper mantle and, through joint interpretation with the attenuation model and laboratory measurements of attenuation and wave speed, place constraints on the variations in temperature, composition, partial melt, and water in the North American upper mantle. The attenuation model will be derived from measurements of Rayleigh wave amplitude and body-wave attenuation at USArray stations throughout the contiguous United States, and the velocity model will be derived from Rayleigh wave travel-time and local site-amplification observations. Separating the competing effects of focusing by elastic structure and anelastic decay on the Rayleigh wave amplitudes is the primary obstacle to imaging small-scale attenuation variations; spectral-element simulations with high-resolution elastic models for the U.S. that have been made possible by USArray will be used to compute focusing effects with greatly improved accuracy. The educational activities are targeted at high-school and undergraduate students. Educational seismometers will be installed at two Providence, RI area high schools. Data recorded by these seismometers and USArray stations will be used to engage the high-school students in earthquake science, fundamental properties of waves, and the tectonic history of North America. Teaching modules utilizing these data that address the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) will be developed and disseminated more widely. At the undergraduate level summer interns will carry out research projects at Brown during three summers, and a new field course in Environmental Geophysics will be developed."

Why do natives oppose or support immigrants more in some locations than others? Upon arriving in new countries, immigrants' experiences vary greatly across both space and time. In some cases, immigrants are able to thrive in their new location, succeeding economically while peacefully coexisting with nationals. Yet in other cases, immigrants are lodged in perpetual poverty and have strained relations with nationals.  One important determinant of successful integration is the context in which immigrants settle. The PI contends that locations governed by anti-immigrant parties will hinder immigrants' successful immigration.

The PI argues that locations governed by anti-immigrant parties will hinder immigrants' successful immigration. The PI argues further that highly homogenous immigrant communities foster anti-immigrant attitudes. These arguments will be tested by leveraging a quasi-experiment in refugee location that occurred in Denmark.  The quasi-experiment comes in the form of the Spatial Dispersion Policy of 1986-1998, in which refugees were assigned to municipalities around Denmark. Combined with micro data from government registers, this will allow the PI to test the expectations described above. Second, this project will investigate the role of local-level diversity among immigrants as a determinant of native opposition to immigration. This argument will be tested with a survey experiments in Denmark. Respondents will be randomly selected to view a vignette about either a high or low diversity immigrant community and then asked their opinion about immigrants and immigration. Reported opinions between the high and low diversity groups will be compared to evaluate the theoretical expectation. Overall, this study intends to bring important light to how society can best overcome the challenges presented by immigration in the coming years."

MSMU primarily serves women and has a long-standing commitment to providing quality programs to under-served and financially disadvantaged students. This project entitled ""Supporting Scholars to Succeed in STEM (S4) Program"" will support strong education and leadership opportunities for an ethnically diverse population.   New knowledge is added to existing research via the design and construction of the S4 data dashboard to track impacts of each program activity on STEM enrollment, retention, success, and graduation of low income women.  Eighteen talented students will be recruited and provided with S-STEM scholarships to retain, support and graduate the students into the workforce or to graduate programs.<br/><br/>Research indicates that institutions with high retention rates consistently use retention software incorporating an early alert system to identify students at risk of dropping out. Building upon this research the S4 program will improve data analytics and early alert mechanisms by creating the S4 dashboard to identify factors contributing to low retention and graduation rates, to diagnose these factors and enable the leadership team to use the data reports generated to inform targeted responses. The analysis of on-track indicators by discipline and student subgroup, will enable the team to understand which milestones students are failing to reach, which subgroups are struggling most to reach each milestone, and why students are not reaching specific milestones. The research enables STEM faculty, administrators, and student support staff to identify the variables contributing to low retention and graduation rates. The aim is to diagnose the results of the various strategies used to ensure success, to measure the impact of each curricular and co-curricular support service thereby helping the Leadership team to make data driven improvements to curriculum, instruction, support services and institutional policies.  An external evaluator will provide formative and summative evaluation applications and metrics for each of the project's five program objectives."

For example, we know that the type and density of plants affect where sparrows can be found. However, many animals rely heavily on non-visual senses, such as hearing, when interacting with their surroundings and deciding where to live. Although the acoustic environment -- what animals hear -- may be important to many species, it remains largely unexplored as a force influencing where animals can be found. This project will examine the extent to which natural sounds, such as those generated by wind and water, influence where animals settle, how they interact with one another and, ultimately, how they structure entire communities. Focusing on birds and bats, the investigators will conduct a large-scale experiment in which they place many speakers in the forest to create ""phantom"" oceans and rivers -- the sounds of moving water without the water itself.  This will allow them to figure out how sounds can change the way in which species interact with their environment and with each other. Specifically, this study will test how noise can explain where animals live, how they behave, and the extent to which they are impacted by human-made noise generated, for example, along major highways. This study will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students at small universities and will result in an ""Acoustics in Ecology and Evolution"" workshop to teach young scientists how to incorporate acoustics into their own ecological field research.<br/><br/>Researchers will test for acoustic impacts on bird and bat communities in areas characterized by high levels of natural sounds from moving water (natural river and ocean surf sounds), low levels of natural sounds, high levels of artificially created natural sounds (phantom river and surf sounds), and spectrally-shifted, artificially created natural sounds.  The latter two treatments will be generated via large-scale playbacks of sounds recorded elsewhere. The experimental approach of playing back natural sounds at different frequencies will allow researchers to parse the influence of acoustic masking versus more general effects of sounds (e.g., disturbance and distraction) on bird and bat behavior and on community structure.  Researchers will also assess the potential role of low frequency natural sounds as acoustic beacons for habitat selection. Field work will entail a combination of behavioral experiments, bird, bat, arthropod and vegetation surveys, and spatially explicit quantification of the acoustic environment.  Researchers will test hypotheses regarding how sounds structure communities directly by masking cues used for communication or predator/prey detection, directly via elevated perceived risk through a reduction in auditory surveillance, or indirectly by altering prey distributions."

Earth's magnetic field lines are ""frozen"" into the plasma and thus are entrained in this convection.  Of particular interest, the feet of these convecting magnetic field lines thread the ionosphere (a layer of charged particles in the Earth's upper atmosphere) at high latitudes and set the ionospheric plasma into motion as well, forming patterns of convection that change as the solar wind changes.   At lower latitudes the ionospheric plasma co-rotates with the Earth. Disturbances in the solar wind associated with stormy space weather strengthen the convection in the magnetosphere, which has the effect of expanding the convection pattern in the ionosphere equatorward into regions where previously the ionospheric plasma was co-rotating. This project aims at improving knowledge of the portion of the expanded convection pattern in the mid-latitude region, where observations have previously been sparse, using a set of newly built radars. This is crucial to understanding space storms and their effects at Earth.  The improved convection patterns from this project will enable a broad spectrum of new research. This geoscience postdoctoral fellowship will support the further training of an early-career scientist. It will also ultimately result in more accurate space weather models of value to society.<br/><br/>To accomplish its goals, this project will use the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), which is a primary tool for constructing the high-latitude convection pattern and its variability. Recently SuperDARN expanded its coverage in the northern hemisphere by adding nine mid-latitude radars and three polar cap radars to better resolve these sections of the convection pattern.  The work will use seven years of SuperDARN data from 2008 through 2014 in combination with solar wind observations from the OMNI 2 database to produce an expanded and improved model of the high-latitude convection pattern as it responds to solar wind drivers."

In return, most of these bacteria harvest extra energy from the diet and protect against infection. However, a range of factors can trigger the gut immune system to activate an inflammation response and produce anti-microbial molecules that harm beneficial bacteria while leading the a bloom of non-beneficial bacterial. It has become widely accepted the that gut microbiome is important, nevertheless, the understanding how the fluctuations in diet and bacterial composition affect the immune system and how the 'good' bacteria maintain a healthy state remains largely unknown. A major limitation is a lack of technologies for non-invasively measuring the molecules produced by the gut immune system. The investigator seeks to overcome this limitation by engineering harmless, orally ingestible 'sensor bacteria' that specifically detect these molecules and respond by expression of a reporter (that might give rise to a color change of the bacteria, for example) that can be evaluated after passage through the gut.  The investigator will use a combination of computational and experimental techniques to evaluate the ability of these sensor bacteria to probe molecular interactions that impact the gut microbiome.  This work supports NSFs mission to understand a fundamental complex and poorly understood biological processes at a molecular level. It may also offer down-stream opportunities to reduce or eliminate some of the prevalent bowel diseases. The planned broader impact activities emphasize student education and public outreach to demonstrate how basic research can have profound beneficial impacts on society.<br/><br/>The mammalian gut maintains a large and diverse community of bacteria that performs numerous beneficial functions. The so-called gut microbiota is largely comprised of anaerobic fermenters that digest host- and diet-derived oligosaccharides. However, metabolites produced by minority members can induce a host inflammatory response, which enriches the local environment with reactive oxygen species, leading to the accumulation of oxidized metabolites. These metabolites can be respired by facultative anaerobes leading to blooms of otherwise rare gut members, under certain conditions. The consequence can be long-term microbial imbalance, or dysbiosis. The precise connection between the temporal dynamics of oxidized metabolite production and consumption leading to undesirable microbial blooms remains poorly understood.  This project uses a systems and synthetic biology approach to engineer bacteria to sense physiologically-relevant signals in the gut. The sensor bacteria would report on the state of the gut microbiome during its transient passage through the gut, providing a molecular-level understanding of gut physiology and dynamics."

Scavenging ambient energy from environment to power these devices can eliminate the cost of replacing batteries, particularly in remote environment. The hybrid energy harvesters developed in this project will significantly improve the power output and response dynamic frequency, therefore provide sufficient power to many such devices. The high power density will also enable more frequent data acquisition and transmission of such sensor networks, and promote more ubiquitous deployment of advanced sensor networks. The automatic manufacturing process will enable their adoption by various customers including internet of things.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop manufacturing processes for advanced hybrid energy harvesters. Although piezoelectric energy harvesters have found broad applications, their power density and mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency are still low, with values at microwatts to milliwatt and <10%, respectively since they primarily operate at the d31 mode of the piezoelectric transducer and the mechanical impedance mismatch between the vibration source and the harvesting device. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced hybrid energy harvesting device can provide significantly higher power density at > 100 mW and conversion efficiency at > 40% by using the more efficient d33 piezoelectric mode and with reduced stiffness in a curved structure that can efficiently transfer the energy from the vibration source to the active piezoelectric materials. The Phase II project will be focused on developing low-cost innovative automatic manufacturing process to enable their practical applications in commercial and industrial market."

Layers of volcanic ash (tephra) embedded in glacial ice can be used to establish an accurate ice core chronology. In order to use a visible or ultrafine volcanic ash layer as a time-stratigraphic marker, a unique geochemical fingerprint must be established, and this forms the basis of our research. This award will investigate the volcanic record in the 1751 m ice core that was completed at the South Pole during the 2015/16 field season. The core is in an ideal location to link the existing, established, volcanic records in East and West Antarctica, and therefore to connect and integrate those records, allowing the climate records of ice cores to be directly compared, as well as to focus research on the most widespread and significant volcanic eruptions from West Antarctica.  Tephra derived from well-dated, large, tropical volcanic eruptions that may have had an impact on climate will also be studied.   Recent success in identifying and analyzing very fine ash particles from these types of eruptions makes it likely that we will be able to pinpoint some of these eruptions, which will allow the sulfate peaks associated with these layers to be positively identified and dated. Volcanic forcing time series developed from earlier South Pole ice cores based on preserved sulfate were crucial for testing climate models, but without tephra analysis, the origin of these layers remains uncertain. <br/><br/>Work on the tephra layers in the South Pole ice core has a number of significant specific objectives, some with practical applications to the basic science goals of Antarctic ice coring, and others that represent independent scientific contributions in their own right. These include: (1) providing independently dated time-intervals in the core, particularly for the deepest ice, (2) quantitatively linking tephra records across Antarctica with the goal of allowing direct and robust climate comparisons between these different parts of the continent, (3) providing information for large local eruptions, that will lead to direct estimates of eruption magnitude and dispersal patterns of Antarctic volcanoes, several of which will likely erupt again. The initial stages of the work will be carried out by identifying silicate-bearing horizons in the ice core, using several methods.  Once found, silicate particles will be imaged so that morphological characteristics of the particles can be used to identify volcanic origin.  Particles identified as tephra will then be chemically analyzed using electron microprobe and laser ablation ICP-MS.  Samples that yield a robust chemical fingerprint will be statistically correlated to known eruptions, and this will be used to address the goals described above.  Broader impacts of this project fall into the areas of education of future generation of researchers, outreach and international cooperation. These activities will continue to promote forward progress in integrating the Antarctic tephra record and more broadly tying it to the global volcanic record."

Compressive sensing enables robots to quickly extract information from their environment, efficiently communicate that information to each other over a wireless network, and intelligently direct their motion to obtain relevant sensing data in the future.  Significant theoretical and technical challenges must be addressed in this project to realize the potential of a compressive robotic sensing system.  The project will demonstrate results in two specific applications, (i) driving a group of aerial robots to monitor their environment, (ii) driving robotic micro-probes to measure processes inside a living cell.  The project also seeks to disseminate its findings through educational and outreach activities.  Results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in control theory at both Boston University and Stanford University.  The researchers will also work with high school students and undergraduates through research mentorship programs and through lab demonstrations for visitors.<br/><br/>The fundamental goal of the project is to create rigorously analyzed algorithms that take advantage of sparse signal descriptions to create efficient motion plans for a team of sensing robots that monitor the environment.  The driving hypothesis is that sparsity can greatly extend the performance of robotic sensing systems by saving battery power, computation, storage, and communication bandwidth---all critically limited resources for robotic platforms.  The research team will take a Bayesian approach to Compressive Sensing, which allows for sensing quality to be quantified with information theoretic metrics such as entropy.  A receding horizon control approach will be developed for driving robotic sensors to collect the most valuable sensor data, in order to reconstruct a sparse representation of their environment using Compressive Sensing.  Such control strategies will be adapted to both static and dynamic environments, and both centralized and distributed solutions will be sought. The concepts developed in this project will be applied to two specific sensing domains: (i) networks of quadrotor sensing robots sensing environmental data and (ii) confocal fluorescence microscopy for three-dimensional imaging of dynamics in bio-molecular systems. These two application domains have radically different length and time scales, dynamical properties, and information content. A successful application of the ideas developed in this project to both these domains will prove the generality of the Compressive Robotic Sensing System concept."

This project will assess the risk of scour-induced bridge failures by integrating experimental, numerical, and theoretical research and educational efforts. Specific tasks that will be conducted include: designing a scour sensing system; improving theory on estimating scour hole depths; developing experimentally validated and accurate numerical scour models; and system testing and validation. Five major research tasks that will be accomplished during this three-year project will allow us to quantify the risk of scour-induced bridge failure using direct sensor measurements of scour hole evolution coupled with numerical model updating. First, a ""scour net"" hardware/software system that can measure scour topography and will optimize them for use in challenging operating environments will be designed. Second, the sensors will be used for measuring jet-induced scour hole evolution and will be used to improve established relationships. Then, fluid-structure models will be implemented, updated using experimental scour topography and bridge dynamic response data, and validated by rigorous experimental testing. The scour net system and numerical models will also be validated through large-scale testing using a unique scour monitoring test bed located in the Hydrotech Research Institute of National Taiwan University.

The results will advance sensor technology, structural health monitoring, hydraulic engineering, and structural engineering fields of study. The ability to monitor scouring, model and predict their evolution in time, and measure its impact on entire transportation infrastructure systems will be critical for achieving safe, resilient, next-generation cities that can adapt to global climate changes. Broader impact of research will be in the form of advancing scour monitoring, computational model updating of turbulent fluid flow, scouring, sediment erosion, and substructure degradation, and the integration of experiment and theory for probabilistic failure prediction."

Decisions under uncertainty are a basic feature of life and of the human experience. The PIs seek to understand how such decisions are made in the context of financial markets. Understanding financial decisions will shed light on how individuals make choices under uncertainty and aid our understanding of financial markets and models. This can help us uncover, for example, the causes of financial crisis.<br/><br/>The proposed research carries out a set of novel experiments on decisions under uncertainty in financial settings. The most fundamental theory of decisions under uncertainty is subjective expected utility (SEU). Its use is ubiquitous is economics, and other social sciences. The PIs propose a new experimental and empirical approach to testing SEU and its generalizations: state dependent expected utility (SDU), and maxmin expected utility (MEU).<br/><br/>The proposed research seeks to elucidate the applicability and scope of the most important theories of choice under uncertainty in a financial market environment. Such environments have been, and continue to be, the focus of academic research in economics, and the general interest of the public. It is crucial to further our understanding of financial market that we understand the applicability of the most commonly-used theories of individual choice in such markets. The new approach contains two key innovations: 1) it provides non-parametric revealed preference tests, allowing for a test of the theory that does not rest on particular parametric assumptions; and 2) it assumes an environment of financial decision making under uncertainty."

The work focuses on healthcare as an application domain where real-time video analysis can prevent user-errors in operating medical devices or provide immediate alerts to caregivers about dangerous situations.  The research will develop algorithms to automatically adapt data analysis approaches to maximize accuracy of analysis within a short time period despite limited available computing resources. Today's healthcare environment is significantly more technologically sophisticated than ever before. Many medical devices are now frequently used in patient's homes, ranging from simple equipment such as canes and wheelchairs to sophisticated items such as glucose meters, ambulatory infusion pumps and laptop-sized ventilators. The rapidly growing home health industry raises new safety concerns about devices being used inappropriately in the home setting. The proposed research is designed to reduce medical device related use-errors by developing computational algorithms that perform real-time video analysis and alert the patient or caregiver when medical devices are not used appropriately. The real-time video and sensor data analysis is also critical to the healthcare systems that monitor the activities of the elderly or those with disabilities in order to allow a caregiver to react immediately to an incident. <br/><br/>New machine learning theories and algorithms will automatically adapt to hardware limitations, with the aim to learn from a large number of training examples, a prediction function that (i) is sufficiently accurate in making effective predictions and (ii) can be run efficiently on a specified computer system to deliver time critical results. Three types of prediction models are studied to address the problem of automatic hardware adaptation, including a vector-based model, a matrix-based model, and a prediction model based on a function from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).  A general framework and multiple optimization techniques are being developed to learn accurate prediction models that match limited memory and computational capacity. The new learning algorithms will be evaluated in several medical scenarios through real-time prediction of a patient's activities from observations in the large video archives collected by several healthcare related projects.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is in bridging the gap between the high complexity of a prediction model and limited computational resources, a scenario that is encountered in many application domains besides healthcare. The proposed research in machine learning algorithms and theories will make it possible to run complicated prediction algorithms on big data within the limitation of a given computing infrastructure. The developed techniques for automatic hardware adaptation will be applied to a large dataset of continuous video and sensor recordings for medically-critical activity recognition.  The project's broader impacts include providing medical experts with algorithms and tools supporting novel approaches to analyzing observational data in their quest to recognize and characterize human behavior. Surveillance systems with continuous observations will be able to categorize salient events with co-located, limited hardware. Researchers with complex data from continuous streams will be able to explore their domains with greater accuracy within constrained time using their available computing resources. Similarly, large archives can be exploited as rapidly as possible with limited hardware."

In these plasmas, where collisions between charged particles are rare, energy can be transferred to a charged particle from a plasma wave (analogous to a surfer on an ocean wave).  As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another, and for energizing a small portion of the population to very high energies.  There are many types of plasma waves. Microphysics tells us that plasma waves, called electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (EMIC), are able to scatter electrons formerly trapped in the radiation belts into the atmosphere where they are lost.  However, the relative importance of EMIC waves to the global variability of the radiation belts has been a subject of intense scientific debate for the past 50 years. The main goal of the research is to resolve this debate by combining multi-point conjugate measurements of particles and fields in space with electron precipitation.  The capability for making these measurements was recently expanded by the Van Allen Probes and BARREL balloons missions.  The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The resulting global maps of relativistic electron precipitation will be useful to the broader space physics and aeronomy communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>To address the open questions raised above, the methodology is to construct large-scale maps of plasma and wave fields in space and correlated maps of high-energy electrons precipitating into the atmosphere from multiple satellites both at high- and low-Earth orbit.  At issue is how long radiation belt electrons actually travel through regions occupied by EMIC waves as they move along closed drift path in the radiation belts.  The longer they interact with the EMIC waves the more likely they will be scattered out of their closed drift paths and be lost.  If the waves exist only in  limited regions that are sparsely distributed throughout the radiation belts, or turn on and off rapidly, their cumulative effects may be insignificant.  Comparing these maps not only provides information about the global distribution of plasma waves but also about whether the relationships between the mapped quantities are consistent with EMIC waves.  Even if these maps are not consistent with EMIC wave interactions with the energetic particles and cold plasmas, they provide clues to, and place constraints on, other mechanisms.."

Interestingly, some herbivores are able to eat and then use these naturally-occurring chemicals to protect themselves from predators and parasites.  Because bees consume large amounts of nectar and pollen that contain these chemicals, they may be able use them as a form of self-medication.  This work will test that idea.  The research has three main objectives: (1) Pollen and nectar will be collected from wild plant species and tested for potentially protective chemicals. This will reveal the extent to which bees are naturally exposed to such chemicals. (2) Laboratory experiments will determine which chemicals may affect disease in bees. (3) Laboratory and field experiments will test the role of the same chemicals on disease transmission between flowers and bees. Taken together, this research represents a novel approach and will provide insight into how plant defensive chemicals can impact wild animals.<br/><br/>This work also addresses the contemporary societal issue of bee health and disease. Many bee populations are in steep decline, which poses a large threat to society because bees provide pollination services that are essential for plant conservation and crop production -- services that are worth billions of dollars annually in the United States.  While the combination of many factors is responsible for the crash of bee populations, diseases are one of the major culprits.  Understanding whether bees can use particular compounds in nectar and pollen to self-medicate has great potential for discovery of new mechanisms to manage bee diseases and combat pollinator decline.  Finally, by training students in bee ecology, this project will help produce a new generation of scientists with the skills needed to pursue solutions to bee decline and other ecological threats."

Optimization models, when combined with novel statistical analysis, have been proven fruitful in analyzing these complex datasets. However, optimization problems arising from these applications often involve nonsmooth components that can significantly slow down the convergence of existing optimization algorithms. Moreover, the complex datasets are so big and often distributed over different storage locations that the usual assumption that an entire dataset can be completely traversed in each iteration of the algorithm is unrealistic. Gradient sliding schemes do not require this assumption and hence are ideally suited for optimization with big data.  The research aims at tackling these computational challenges through the design, analysis, and implementation of a novel class of optimization algorithms using gradient sliding schemes.  The effectiveness of these new optimization algorithms will be demonstrated by solving problems in image processing and machine learning.<br/><br/>The gradient sliding algorithms are first-order methods that use first-order information (gradients and function values) exclusively in addition to some auxiliary operations, such as projection over the feasible set. As opposed to existing first-order methods, gradient sliding methods can skip the computation of gradients from time to time, while still preserving the optimal convergence properties for solving different types of large-scale optimization problems. This research will also study a new class of conditional gradient sliding methods that require a linear optimization rather than a more involved projection over the feasible set in each iteration. These algorithms are expected to exhibit optimal rate of convergence in terms of both the number of gradient computations and the number of times for solving the linear optimization subproblem. Moreover, randomized variants of these gradient sliding algorithms which are amenable to parallel/distributed computing will also be studied.  When applied to data analysis, these algorithms can reduce, by orders of magnitude, the number of traverses through the datasets, the computational cost associated with the involved matrix-vector multiplications, as well as the communication costs for the distributed datasets."

The cells in cartilage -  chondrocytes - perceive and respond to mechanical loading, which provide crucial signals for the normal development and maintenance of cartilage.  However, abnormal loading can lead to cartilage breakdown and osteoarthritis.  In this regard, an understanding of the mechanisms by which cells sense loading can provide important insights into the regulation of cartilage development, maintenance, and regeneration.  This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research to examine several new and specific pathways by which cells can sense mechanical signals, particularly the fluid pressure that occurs in cartilage as it is compressed.  This project will examine the role of various ion channels on the cell membrane as sensors of fluid pressure.  An improved understanding of these sensors could allow a means of manipulating the biological response of chondrocytes to prevent degeneration or to enhance tissue repair.  <br/><br/>Chondrocytes in articular cartilage respond to biophysical signals engendered in their extracellular matrix secondary to mechanical loading.  Due to the complex properties of the charged and hydrated cartilage matrix, physiological loading of cartilage exposes the chondrocytes to a variety of biophysical stimuli, including hydrostatic pressure.  Hydrostatic pressure has been clearly shown to enhance both chondrocyte matrix production and the transition of stem cells into chondrocytes.  Specifically, hydrostatic pressure, as opposed to other loading regimes, has been shown to drive chondrogenesis within the developing skeleton. However, the mechanism by which chondrocytes and stem cells transduce a hydrostatic pressure signal into a biological response is not understood. The goal of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of hydrostatic pressure signal transduction in chondrocytes and in chondrogenesis. Recent work has shown that chondrocytes transduce mechanical loading via a variety of mechanosensitive calcium channels in the transient receptor potential and PIEZO families.  Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine if hydrostatic pressure is transduced through these classes of mechanosensitive ion channels on the cell membrane.  The identification of the specific cellular and molecular transduction mechanisms in chondrocytes and chondrogenic stem cells that are activated by hydrostatic pressure could allow a means of manipulating the biological response of chondrocytes or stem cells to prevent osteoarthritis or enhance cartilage regeneration."

Collective innovation works by breaking problems down into many constituent sub-problems, actively engaging a broad group of stakeholders and potential users, and coordinating people with the disparate knowledge needed to solve each piece of a bigger puzzle. This project will create interactive computer systems to support these processes. The proposed research has the potential to fundamentally improve the way people work collectively to solve challenging problems, from small-scale user interfaces to bigger and messier society-scale challenges and to increase the number of people engaged in innovation, important to achieving national objectives. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project will contribute novel interactive systems to explore three key challenges for advancing collective innovation: 1) how to synthesize large collections of prior research and examples in order to frame appropriate research questions, 2) how to productively select and build on the most promising and creative ideas, and 3) how to effectively engage in large-scale participatory design by gathering feedback from an existing community or harvesting it through crowdsourcing and social media. To guide and motivate the design of these systems, this research builds on (and draws explicit links between) theories of design thinking and collective intelligence. The systems developed will be evaluated in authentic, externally valid settings to identify the real-world patterns that emerge when these processes are integrated. The resulting experimental tools will be released as open source so that other researchers may build on the project's progress. The project also includes significant educational goals: training student researchers in social computing system design, design thinking, and evaluation methods; creating a new graduate course on collective innovation; and scaling up the PI's current design studio course."

While these new polymers cannot precisely duplicate the properties of naturally occurring materials, they can be modified at the atomic level to afford materials with different and potentially improved properties.  For electronic applications, semiconducting polymers that rival inorganic-based materials are readily prepared. Furthermore, it is possible to alter their properties through chemical synthesis, prepare a large amount of material under moderate conditions, and fabricate large-area films using solution-processing techniques such as inkjet printing. All of these can significantly reduce the cost of polymer-based solar cells. This award will (i) support research intended to increase basic knowledge for designing and producing conducting polymers with optimized properties for use in ""plastic"" solar cells; (ii) provide interdisciplinary research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students, and (iii) foster interest in polymer science through a creative outreach effort targeting female and underrepresented minority students at all educational levels.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY. <br/><br/>Due to their unique combination of semiconducting and polymer processing properties, conjugated polymers are being explored both academically and commercially for use in organic electronic applications. Two important benefits of these materials are the opportunity to optimize their optical and electronic properties for specific applications through synthesis and the chance to reduce the cost of electronic device manufacturing through the use of solution processing techniques. Although a number of different conjugated polymers have been synthesized, only a few have exhibited high efficiencies in organic photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, many of these are based on complex combinations of heterocycles that are difficult to synthesize. The vision and goals of this project are to develop new polymers based on benzodichalocogenophenes, a class of heterocycles that includes benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene, which has been used in copolymers for high performing organic photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, these building blocks can be easily synthesized in a few high yielding steps from low-cost starting materials and are readily customized. This project will (i) evaluate the impact of atomic engineering on the materials properties; (ii) investigate the physical, optical, and electronic properties of the materials through spectroscopic measurements and performance in organic photovoltaic cells; (iii) provide interdisciplinary research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students, and (iv) foster interest in polymer science through a creative outreach effort targeting female and underrepresented minority students at all educational levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This work is having a broad impact not only on the electronics industry, but also by providing an interdisciplinary research experience for both undergraduate and graduate students, which fosters an interest in chemistry through a creative outreach effort targeting female and underrepresented minority students at all educational levels.<br/><br/>This project focuses on developing new cross-conjugated organic semiconductors for use in organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells. In particular, novel cross-conjugated oligomers comprised of the robust benzobisoxazole (BBO) moiety are being studied. BBO is used as the electron-deficient building block since it is a unique cross-conjugated ring system that can be coupled either through the oxazole rings or through the central benzene ring, producing substances with different properties. The group is synthesizing materials with perpendicular conjugation axes because they have spatially segregated frontier molecular orbitals. This provides a means for semi-independent tuning of either the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). The benefits of the approach are that the cross-conjugated platform allows for the opportunity to optimize the material?s optical and electronic properties for specific applications. Various materials are being prepared and the most promising ones studied further by incorporation into working devices."

The project also addresses the immediate challenge presented by the Next Generation Science Standards to prepare middle school science teachers to implement rich computational thinking (CT) experiences, such as the use, creation and analysis of computer models and simulations, within science classes. <br/><br/>The project, a partnership between the Santa Fe Institute and the Santa Fe Public School District, directly addresses middle school teachers' understanding, practice, and teaching of modern scientific practice.  Using the Project GUTS program and professional development model as a foundation, this project will design and develop a set of Resources, Models, and Tools (RMTs) that collectively form the basis for a comprehensive professional development (PD) program, then study teachers' experiences with the RMTs and assess how well the RMTs prepared teachers to implement the curriculum. The PD program includes: an online PD network; workshops; webinars and conferences; practicum and facilitator support; and curricular and program guides. The overall approach to the project is design based implementation research (DBIR). Methods used for the implementation research includes:  unobtrusive measures such as self-assessment sliders and web analytics; the knowledge and skills survey (KS-CT); interviews (teachers and the facilitators); analysis of teacher modified and created models; and observations of practicum and classroom implementations.  Data collection and analysis in the implementation research serve two purposes: a) design refinement and b) case study development.

The research will also contribute a mathematical framework for testing the robustness of the ecological proposals that the spatial patterns may serve as early warning signs of tipping points associated with climate change.<br/><br/>The research will be developed within a framework of deterministic and stochastic mathematical ecological models, with its objectives enhanced by the availability of rich satellite data that can be used to test model predictions.

This analysis will be based in bifurcation theory. The second objective is to develop and analyze vegetation models with temporally variable precipitation inputs, and spatially variable drainage networks. This will lead to the development of stochastic models with non-Gaussian noise. Model reduction methods will be used to further determine the consistency between model frameworks. Satellite image data of dry-land ecosystems will inform and verify the modeling effort.

Studies to expand and develop these forays into robust synthetic methods will be undertaken. Asymmetric alkylations of zincated and magnesiated nitriles will be performed through a combination of screening and mechanistic probes to address one of the most difficult challenges in the field: stereoselective alkylation of a chiral, metalated nitrile.<br/><br/>The research is likely to lead to new methods for stereoselectively assembling hindered, quaternary centers. Fields as diverse as medicine and materials rely on exactly this type of robust chemistry. The nitrile-based arylation is particularly well suited to the synthesis of several nitrile-containing pharmaceuticals and drug leads because the method uses an inexpensive, abundant copper catalyst rather than palladium catalysts that are currently required for the same transformation.<br/><br/>Three broader impacts will be reached through this research: institutional development, elevation of nitrile chemistry, and student training.

This project focuses on unraveling how human gaze control operates during active real-world scene perception.<br/> <br/>This project approaches human gaze control by starting with the insight that understanding eye movement timing will provide key insight into the underlying cognitive and neural systems that control gaze. The research combines innovative eye-tracking methods with a working computational model that simulates eye movement control.

On the one hand, we can test our understanding of gaze control by determining whether the model can produce eye movements that look like those produced by people. On the other hand, insights from the model can be used as a tool to enhance our theoretical understanding of gaze control, and these insights can be further tested with new experiments.<br/> <br/>The results from this project will enhance basic scientific understanding of how humans perceive and understand the visual world.

This project is designed to have low demands on the implementing instructors in terms of time, budget, equipment and instructor expertise. The intention is to provide easy access to an authentic inquiry-based activity without compromising curriculum requirements and time constraints. Additionally, this project will provide a low-stakes gateway to transition instructors from using traditional teaching practices to inquiry-based learning in their classrooms. <br/><br/>The specific aims of the project are: (1) to develop teaching and learning materials and a research plan accessible to instructors from a variety of institution types serving a broad demographic range of students, (2) to provide a course-based research experience to at least 900 secondary and 900 undergraduate students, (3) to create partnerships that increase access of secondary school students and teachers to undergraduate-level scientists and students and (4) to generate a database of antibiotic resistance through the crowd-sourcing effort of hundreds of high school and college students.

Metabolic heat generation occurs predominantly through oxygen-dependent (aerobic) metabolism, and reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) at high altitude may limit the capacity for maintaining of the optimal body temperature. This study will use populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) adapted to different altitudes as a model to determine which physiological mechanisms permit them to survive under hypoxic and cold conditions of high altitudes. The PIs will use a combination of physiological, genetic and metabolic studies to identify the potentially adaptive traits in mice at different altitudes and use modeling approach to integrate these traits and link them to the organism?s fitness in different environments. Although this study focuses on the populations of deer mice, many molecular and physiological mechanisms of metabolic regulation and thermoregulation are highly conserved among the mammals; therefore, the findings of this study will have implications for understanding physiological adaptations to cold and hypoxia in high-altitude populations of other mammals including humans.  This project integrates research with diverse and extensive educational and public outreach activities including training of graduate and undergraduate students, fostering international collaborations, workshops for high school teachers and public displays at a local museum. <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to identify the mechanistic basis of adaptive population differences in thermogenic capacity between deer mice that are native to different elevations. The investigators will conduct common-garden acclimation experiments in captive-bred, pedigreed mice to assess the roles of phenotypic plasticity and genotypic specialization in adaptation to different altitudes. Measures of whole-animal thermogenic capacity will be integrated with measures of various subordinate traits and a functional genomic analysis of the underlying regulatory networks. The scale of this systems-level analysis, which involves a sophisticated modeling effort to integrate a comprehensive set of physiological, genetic and metabolic variables, has never before been attempted. This research will yield important insights into the mechanistic basis of physiological adaptation to the combined challenges of hypoxia and cold exposure. This research involves an important collaboration with investigators at McMaster University in Canada, who have specialized expertise and access to facilities required for conduct of some experiments.

The undergraduate research experiences are being supported by co-funding from the International Science and Engineering section of the Office of International and Integrative Activities. Stories about life in extreme environments exert a powerful hold on the public imagination, and the investigators will capitalize on this fascination to develop a public outreach program that is centered on the ""Sunday with a Scientist"" program at the University of Nebraska State Museum. Programs will be developed for the general public that will focus on 'adaptation to extreme environments'. At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, researchers will be involved in a series of workshops in evolutionary biology aimed at assisting high school teachers to develop tools and effective approaches to teach evolutionary biology using examples from this research."

These include the changes that occur in biological materials, in semiconductor materials, and in plastics.  Although computational modeling is increasingly able to describe these processes, serious challenges remain.  For example, it is very important to be able to understand what happens to the energy that is deposited in molecules through the absorption of light.  Such knowledge is a critical element for our understanding of the degradation of materials, of the functioning of solar cells, and of biological processes such as photosynthesis. The specific objective of the present studies is the development of new, generally applicable, theoretical and computational models and methods that can fully describe chemistry involving very light atoms and electrons, where quantum mechanics must be invoked. The algorithms being developed can be directly applied as computational tools for the design of advanced materials, pharmaceutical discovery, and nanoscale engineering.  They can also impact critical practical issues, including affordable solar energy capture for sustainable energy and a sustainable climate. Outreach activities stemming from this work contribute to the future stability of the scientific workforce, as well as to the public's ability to participate in science policy.<br/><br/>The research efforts are developing new simulation algorithms for the quantum mechanical description of nuclear motion that go beyond presently available practical methods in key respects. The novel method is based on the dynamics of Wigner transform variables and is a rather direct generalization of an earlier linearized path integral (""classical Wigner"") approach. The new approach retains the ability to directly evaluate the dynamics of non-linear operators (e.g., in inelastic X-ray scattering) and describes vibrational dynamics without unphysical components associated with the simulation algorithm. Further, since the new method directly propagates the phase space points (in contrast to path-integral based approaches), there is good reason to believe that it can be integrated into a non-adiabatic electronic dynamics protocol. Applications to relatively well-characterized molecular systems are being used to test the capability of new methods. The molecular-scale insight needed to guide us to new materials with desired functions or insight into Nature's solutions will follow from the implementation of advanced computational science, coordinated with revealing experimental probes. The resulting capabilities form the basis for what may be the routine modeling methods of the future, just as the basic research of the last 50 years routinely provides for today's experimental researcher. Project efforts enhance education at all levels, including the professional development of graduate and postdoctoral students as researchers and educators with timely skills in the computational solution of physical problems."

By examining textual information gleaned by processing large volumes of verbal data from 10-K filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal investigators will use techniques developed by computer scientists to assess verbal themes and link them to market data to assess whether future crises are forming. The techniques employed enable the identification of actual risks allowing regulators and market participants the ability to respond appropriately in advance of a major development. The free provision of data and computer code on the internet will lower the cost for future researchers to also examine these issues. The principal investigators will also present the research at conferences, submit the work for publication, and will work with and train graduate students. The material will be taught to future business leaders in the classroom, where MBA students and undergraduate students can openly discuss the results and their implications. The work will also be submitted to conferences attended by regulators to share insights on how they can be used to manage potential crises before they can cause extensive damage.<br/><br/>The principal investigators will use methods from computational linguistics, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and document similarity analysis, to identify a set of verbal topics that are common among financial firms, non-financial firms with exposure to the finance industry, and then all firms in the economy. The investigators will then use clustering and network methods to assess and categorize the business links among firms in the economy and to examine how they evolve over time. The resulting firm-relatedness network will then be compared to market data during various time intervals to understand how and why stock prices comove differently in neighboring periods, especially periods leading up to major crises. The verbal factors will be interpretable, and hence this technique will provide a fully automated description of why firms comove in different ways in different time periods. This method will be replicable and not subjected to researcher prejudice, allowing the data to inform researchers regarding the most salient issues affecting markets, even if the researcher is ex-ante unfamiliar with the true drivers of a specific systemic risk event. Once the textual drivers of comovement are understood, these factors can be used to back-test how the dynamic topic structure evolves during other systemic events. If successful, this research could create an early warning system for potential future crises and serve as a risk management tool by addressing the drivers of crisis before they occur, thereby reducing the cost of resolution.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site: http://cbe.lehigh.edu/kathleen-weiss-hanley"

The increased frequency, duration and intensity of hypoxia events worldwide have led to impaired health and functioning of marine and freshwater ecosystems.  Although the potential impacts of hypoxic exposure are severe, there is little known about the consequences of systemic, sub-lethal exposure to hypoxic events for populations and communities of fishes.  The objective of this project is to determine whether sub-lethal exposure to hypoxia during early life stages leads to poor growth and hence increased mortality.  This project will use ""environmental fingerprint"" methods in fish ear stones (otoliths) retrospectively to identify periods of hypoxia exposure.  The project will compare consequences of hypoxia exposure in different fish species from the Gulf of Mexico, the Baltic Sea, and Lake Erie, thus examining the largest anthropogenic hypoxic regions in the world spanning freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems.  In addition, the research will increase awareness of hypoxia-related issues by disseminating curriculum materials to high schools in southern Texas that are dominated by Hispanic and Latino American students.  As a part of this program, two high school teachers will be sponsored to participate in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ""Teacher At Sea"" program, where they will gain first-hand experience in biological sampling in the northern Gulf of Mexico ""Dead Zone"" and help lead teacher training workshops for additional high school teachers to implement hypoxia-related curriculum in their classrooms.  In addition, this project will contribute significantly to basic information for critical stakeholder groups in Baltic Sea and Great Lakes fisheries via the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission.  Two graduate students and one post-doc will also be supported in part by this project.<br/><br/>This project will employ long-term, permanent markers incorporated into fish otoliths to identify life-long patterns of sub-lethal hypoxia exposure far beyond time spans currently achievable using molecular markers.  This work will capitalize on patterns of geochemical proxies such as Mn/Ca and I/Ca incorporated into otoliths and analyzed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to identify patterns of sub-lethal hypoxia exposure.  The investigators will then determine whether exposure results in differential growth and survival patterns compared to non-exposed fish by tracking cohorts over time and identifying characteristics of survivors.  Because this work involves multiple species in multiple hypoxic regions, it will allow cross-system comparisons among unique ecosystems.  The results from this project will thus provide unprecedented insight into effects of hypoxia exposure in three major basins using novel biogeochemical proxies, thereby paving the way for a fuller understanding of the impacts of ""dead zones"" on coastal resources."

In the computer-aided design of electronic materials, devices, as well as chemical and physical processes, accurate prediction of electronic properties plays a decisive role. While many wave function-based methods are highly accurate, their computational costs are too expensive to be generally useful for practical applications.  For large many-atom systems, DFT is the only method with both the required accuracy and efficiency and for that reason it is the most widely used electronic structure method. However, commonly-used density functionals are unable to achieve universal accuracy.  Tao and coworkers focus on developing functionals with a wider range of applicability.  These functionals are being used to study the properties of diverse systems such as (water) clusters and light-emitting oligomers and polymers. The work involves both method development and numerical application. The project also includes summer outreach programs aimed primarily at undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this research project is the development and application of nonlocal density functionals (DFT), including a new nonlocal correlation energy functional for long-range van der Waals interactions.  The focus of this effort is on solving or mitigating some long-standing difficulties that commonly-used density functionals encounter.   A major outstanding problem for DFT methodology is that a density functional may be accurate for one or more classes of systems, but not for all systems, or for one or more properties, but not for all properties. A goal of this project is to develop a density functional with universal accuracy and wider applicability so that diverse chemical and physical problems can be solved on the same footing, with the same density functional.  Such a density functional must be nonlocal, because the nature of the Coulomb interaction is nonlocal.  Undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs are involved in various aspects of this project."

This lack of understanding is understandable given the complex and interrelated nature of the impacts from extreme events. Communities need to design solutions for infrastructure management, land use planning, public health, and emergency management, understanding how each is related to the other. In areas that are subject to repeated events, the problem is exacerbated. In this project, an interdisciplinary team of researchers will develop an integrated model, the Integrated Hazard, Impact, and Resilience Model to better understand the impacts of repeated hurricanes and heat waves on regional vulnerability and resilience and use the model to develop approaches for improving resilience to these repeated hazards. The team integrates expertise in individual and organizational behavior, economic modeling, climate science, infrastructure engineering, hazard modeling, public health, and spatial landscape analysis. The work on this project will be grounded in and integrated through systems modeling. The goal of the project is to significantly advance the understanding of the impacts from hurricanes and heat waves on the vulnerability and resilience of regions over time and the tools and resources available to help regions better prevent repeated hazards from becoming repeated disasters.<br/><br/>The mid-Atlantic region will be the case study for this project, grounding the work in a critical region of the U.S., one that has a growing population facing increasing threats from weather extremes. The team will also have strong international collaborators, helping to make sure the work has broad applicability to other areas of the world. As part of this project, a set of undergraduates, masters, and doctoral students as well as postdoctoral scholars will be trained in trans-disciplinary hazards research and modeling. This cadre of students and researchers will form a critical resource for the nation, helping to improve regional resilience to repeated hurricanes and heat waves."

Coupled with the increased computational ability of students in other disciplines, it is known that interdisciplinary courses are more appealing to underrepresented groups.  Ideally, the Computer Science community would be provided with a set of validated approaches to interdisciplinary education. In order to reach this goal, the community must investigate the educational value of various approaches.

The investigator proposes to provide a detailed study of highly efficient high-order well-balanced methods in the following directions: 1. Development of well-balanced methods: Very accurate well-balanced numerical methods will be developed for several equations arising in different areas; 2.  Shallow-water equations: Positivity-preserving well-balanced methods for the shallow-water equations will be developed. Then, the investigator will investigate their performance, including efficiency, scalability, etc., and study their potential application in the coastal ocean modeling; 3.  Euler equations under a gravitational field: Hydrodynamical evolution in a gravitational field arises in most astrophysical problems. The investigator will develop well-balanced methods for such system; 4.

Many recent declines have been caused by a deadly chytrid fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Bd has recently spread around the world and infects hundreds of amphibian species. This project focuses on understanding the interaction between the Bd pathogen and its amphibian hosts. Specifically the investigators will learn 1) why some amphibian species are devastated by Bd while others are not harmed and 2) why some strains of Bd are more deadly than others. The investigators will conduct an integrative and worldwide study of numerous Bd isolates and a diversity of frog species. Results from this project will help guide conservation efforts be targeted to the most vulnerable species and to areas where Bd will have the most devastating impact. Further the general understanding of host-pathogen interactions resulting from this project can be applied to other systems where wildlife are threatened with new emerging diseases. The project also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups. In addition to scientific research, the project will provides education about biodiversity and conservation to the public and local public elementary school children through popular press publications, museum exhibits, and an outreach event called ""Save the Frogs Day"". <br/><br/>The researchers in this project have taken genetic, genomic, immunological, and organismal approaches to accomplish their objectives. First, they will use a comparative approach to identify genomic variations in 60 Bd isolates gathered from around the world that vary in infectivity towards various amphibian hosts. Second, they will study variations in in vitro growth phenotypes that they propose directly relate to infectivity. Last, they will examine in vivo and cell culture-based phenotypes, in parallel with host tissue profiling. A key aspect of the third goal is that the applicants have selected 6 congeneric amphibian host pairs (2 species in each of three different genera) that vary in susceptibility to Bd. They will utilize Illumina-based sequencing techniques to obtain genome-wide association studies of the phenotypes of interest. In vivo infection phenotypes such as Bd burden under the common garden conditions tested will be coupled with transcriptomic analysis of host gene expression to evaluate differential responses by susceptible/tolerant hosts. To address this important problem, the investigators have blended evolutionary, ecological and physiological perspectives and this integrative approach promises to bring new insight into this field."

Workshop participants will work with underlying theory about ways that effective teaching can draw out student preconceptions, the importance to students of deep foundation knowledge and a conceptual framework, and the development of metacognitive abilities.   The workshops will also draw on theory about growth and fixed mindsets and the development of expertise.  The specific pedagogic practices utilized will be peer instruction and flipped classrooms, with additional use of live coding, pair programming, discussion of how best to use teaching assistants, and discussion of how technology can support learning.  Online community support and the development by each participant of a teaching portfolio will help solidify use by participants of the practices they learn in the workshops.
