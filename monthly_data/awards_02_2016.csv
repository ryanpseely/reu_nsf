Despite progress and promise in the development of many different biofuel technologies, none have proven economically viable. The aim of this project is to make production of fuels and chemicals from biomass resources economically viable. The poor economics of biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals is due largely to biomass resistance to chemical and biological attack. Three primary platforms have been suggested for overcoming biomass recalcitrance: bio-oil (produced via pyrolysis or liquefaction), synthesis gas (produced by gasification), and sugars (produced by pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis). This proposal is focused on the sugars platform. Biomass resistance to chemical and biological attack makes recovery of monosaccharides expensive and energy intensive. The focus of this work is on recovery of monosaccharides from biomass because this step represents the key technological bottleneck of the sugars platform.<br/><br/>The overarching research objective is to understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying cellulose deconstruction by solid acid catalysts. The approach consists of constructing polymer-brush modified inorganic particles (silica and zeolites) as catalytic microreactors with: 1) well defined external acidity that can be accessed by insoluble substrates, 2) cellulose targeting/binding/solubilization capability to provide interactions between insoluble substrates and external surfaces of solid acids, and 3) internal pore structure and acidity that can be accessed by small molecule soluble substrates. Specific questions to be addressed include: 1) what is the structure/property- function relationship that governs the catalyst-biomass interaction? 2) what is the relationship between solid acid strength and cellulose hydrolysis activity? and 3) what is the balance between external acidity for cellulose chain breaking and internal acidity for hydrolysis of soluble fragments? The project will evaluate the hypothesis that solid acid catalysis is mediated by binding interactions and strong acidity. In the research component of this work, the underlying mechanism will be examined to: 1) understand the role of catalyst-cellulose binding and the relationship between cellulose adhesion, catalyst surface composition, and catalyst surface energy; 2) quantify the role of acidity and answer the question of how acidic the surface needs to be to catalyze hydrolysis; 3) differentiate between external acidic sites required to convert insoluble substrates and internal acidic sites capable of converting soluble carbohydrates.<br/><br/>The research objectives will be integrated with educational and outreach aims to use data-to-music tools to attract students from under-represented backgrounds to careers in STEM fields and to appeal to a broader range of learning styles at the undergraduate level than are typical in the engineering curriculum. In terms of education, the use of music to teach difficult concepts to college engineering students could improve training for students that use learning styles that are not typical in engineering curricula. This has potential to improve retention of a broader range of undergraduate students in STEM fields. The outreach component will provide K-12 students with an engaging STEM experience that empowers rather than alienates. Specifically, research data will be converted into sounds and re-modulated into music, a process that mimics the practice of sampling that drives hip hop music composition."

During this Cretaceous period, the Ontong-Java-Nui (OJN) volcanic outpouring also occurred, creating a large plateau (1/100 of Earth's area) that eventually split apart. With no reversals of the magnetic field to generate the characteristic crustal anomalies that allow scientists to track tectonic plate motions, it has not been possible to understand the cause-effect relation between this deep-generated volcanic activity and the change in plate motion at the surface. While satellite measurements provide some indication of seafloor structure, it is not possible to discern the narrow abyssal hills that form at the fast spreading centers that controlled the plateau breakup. Direct seafloor mapping and sampling are required. Undergraduate and graduate students will receive training in marine geological data acquisition during this study and some will participate in the post-cruise analysis via class projects. Podcasts of a research seminar will extend the reach of the new knowledge.<br/><br/>The OJN breakup must have occurred via spreading at the Osbourn Trough, along unmapped spreading centers in the Ellice Basin. Like other early Cretaceous oceanic plateaus, the OJN seems to have formed near a triple junction. Better understanding of Pacific tectonics during the Cretaceous normal superchron should shed light on the connections between oceanic plateau formation, breakup, plate reorganizations and associations with mantle plumes. In addition, paleolatitude data from the super-plateau remnants can to be tied to a common Pacific reference frame to refine the Pacific apparent polar wander path, which could then be compared with the Indo-Atlantic reference frame to determine the relative contributions from hotspot drift and true polar wander. This is a long-term undertaking that will require several expeditions and contributions from multi-disciplinary investigators. This study takes the first step in this process with a multibeam survey of the Ellice Basin that will combine mapping of the central parts of this large basin where extinct spreading centers are likely to be located and remnants of fracture zones can be easily discerned. Coupled with selective dredging and Ar dating of basaltic rocks, including samples from IODP Site U1365 near Osbourn Trough, it will be possible to determine the timing of the inferred change in spreading direction, termination of Ellice Basin spreading, and the end of rifting along the Osbourn Trough."

It is assumed that when a species evolves to become diurnal or nocturnal, its eyes, olfactory organs, and the genes associated with these structures also evolve. However, this concept remains largely untested, because a comprehensive evolutionary tree and associated comparative data are not available. Silkmoths and relatives are some of the most conspicuous moths, and they provide an excellent opportunity to study how two potentially complementary sensory systems -- sight and smell -- have evolved. The group includes many model organisms, such as the domesticated silkmoth and tobacco hornworm, which play key roles in many areas of the biological sciences. Some silkmoths and relatives are damaging to agriculture, and they are frequently used as an educational tool because of their large size, charisma, and ability to captivate children in classrooms. Despite their role in science and education, this model group still lacks a robust estimate of evolutionary relationships. With collaborative research teams in the United States and the United Kingdom, this project will assemble an extensive genetic dataset and reconstruct a robust evolutionary tree for the group. Two postdoctoral researchers, two graduates students, several undergraduates, and dozens of elementary, middle and high school students will be trained, including many students from under-represented groups. <br/><br/>This study will produce a comprehensive phylogeny of a model insect group, the silkmoths and relatives (Lepidoptera: Bombycoidea) and use it to study the evolution of two principal sensory systems: vision and olfaction. The project will develop a US-UK collaborative partnership across five institutions to initially generate a target capture-based backbone phylogeny based on 700 genetic loci and 1000 species of Bombycoidea.  Scanning electron microscopy and 3D Micro-computed Tomography scanning will then be used to quantify sensory morphology of two key organs (eye and antenna) that are central to insect vision and olfaction.  The molecular evolution of vision and olfactory gene sequences isolated from sensory organ transcriptomes will be analyzed to test for evidence of selection between related diurnal and nocturnal species. Gene sequences will be isolated from frozen and museum specimens using new methodologies, thereby making this tool useful to the broader community of scientists."

Deforestation's environmental impacts, including soil erosion, increased flooding, desertification, and habitat loss, are well-established. Logging can be a deforestation trigger, but agriculture is its biggest driver. Small-scale farmers cut wood for fuel and clear modest spaces for crops; mechanized, industrial farming and large-scale ranching clear larger tracts. Industrial agriculture has increased food production and reduced local food shortages. But because these large scale operations require access to expensive technologies and farming inputs, the expansion of industrial agriculture has also pushed poor rural farmers off their lands into cities and into the global flow of migrants. This confluence of agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, and migration changes local environments, destabilizes local politics, and impacts migrant receiving countries, including the United States.  These processes are well-documented on a global scale, but the local-level micro-processes that set these effects off in the beginning are much more poorly understood. How exactly does mechanized agriculture expand into forested areas? How do smallholders lose control of land? Why do so many end up leaving for urban areas? These are the questions the research funded by this award will address.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out by University of Arizona anthropology doctoral student, Cari Tusing, with the supervision of senior anthropologist  Dr. Linda B. Green. Because these processes have already taken place in the United States, where industrial agriculture is now the norm, Tusing will travel to Paraguay where industrial soy farming is just now moving into forested areas, dramatically modifying the landscape and giving Paraguay a deforestation rate that is among the highest in the world. The researcher will concentrate data collection in the region surrounding the Paraguay-Brazil border, where Brazilians are crossing into Paraguay to develop land for large-scale agriculture and ranching in an area where Paraguayan small-scale farmers and Guarani Amerindians practice agroforestry and subsistence agriculture. The researcher will collect data on land titling; class, race, and national identities; and cultural understandings of the relationship between agriculture and deforestation. For this phase of a multi-phase project, the investigator will focus on the Brazilian (also called Brasiguayo) farmers to document their farming practices, strategies employed to obtain land, and social and economic networks. Data will be collected with multiple social science methods including participant observation, interviews, and farm transect walks. Comparable data have already been collected on small-holder farmers and Guarani Amerindians. Cumulatively, the three data sets will produce a fully rounded account of the nature of recent land-use change and its effects on agricultural production, deforestation, local livelihoods, and rural-to-urban migration."

Observations of exhumed remnants of subduction interface shear zones yield fundamental insight into the processes that control this complexity. The scientific objective of this project is to systematically investigate the rheological properties and evolution of the subduction interface using exhumed rocks. Specifically, the project will investigate the heterogeneity of deformation within subduction interface shear zones and the nature of changes in deformational styles and mechanisms as rocks are progressively subducted to depth. The research component of this project will focus on three exhumed subduction shear zones that each record prograde deformation and that together represent a wide range of pressure-temperature conditions. The field sites include the: 1) Chugach accretionary complex, Alaska (T = 150-300 degrees C, P = 2-5 kilobars), 2) the Condrey Mountain Window, southern Klamath Mountains, northern California (T = 300-420 degrees C, P = 5-7 kilobars), and 3) the Cycladic Blueschist Unit in Syros Island, Greece (T = 450-550 degrees C, P = 2-15 kilobars). The project uses a wide range of structural, microstructural, and petrological tools to track macro-scale distributions of strain, degrees and mechanisms of strain localization, fluctuations in fluid pressures and strain rates, microphysical mechanisms of rock creep, effects of metamorphic reactions on deformation, and sources of anisotropy, in rocks that have been cycled through the subduction process. The research involves: 1) identifying domains in each field area that represent deformation under prograde conditions; 2) documenting macro-scale strain distributions; 3) determining the microphysical mechanisms of rock creep in different rock and mineral phases; and 4) synthesizing the field and microstructural observations in the context of subduction zone mechanics. The integrated educational objective of this CAREER award is to establish a five-year mentoring and research program at the University of Texas ? the Jackson School of Geosciences-Catalyst (JSGC) ? aimed at ethnic and racial minorities and first-generation college students in the Earth Sciences. JSGC will provide 1) mentoring, community support, and career advice for undergraduates through mentorship pairing, monthly meetings, social events, and field trips; and 2) financial support for members while simultaneously enhancing their undergraduate research experience through summer internships, senior thesis projects and participation in field-based team research. The JSGC program is designed to increase retention and completion rates of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and to prepare and encourage these students to go on to graduate school.<br/><br/>Processes in the zone between a subducting oceanic plate and the overriding plate ? the subduction zone interface - are responsible for a all-too-familiar yet poorly understood phenomena such as large devastating earthquakes as well as other more enigmatic events such as episodic slip and tremor. This project aims to improve understanding of this zone through a systematic study of terranes that were exhumed from the depths of the interface by various tectonic processes. These terranes provide an unusual opportunity to understand the geologic processes associated with the various phenomena along the subduction zone interface. Additionally, the project will advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of an early career Hispanic female PI, a female graduate student, and, most notably, a robust plan to provide mentoring, and research and professional development opportunities to underrepresented minorities majoring in Earth Science, thus directly contributing to retention and promotion of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields; (2) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training with emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented groups in Earth science; and (3) increased partnerships through international collaboration."

However, there are still significant issues in big-data analytics, especially, regarding the reproducibility of data-driven research findings. To enable analytic methods from traditional reductionist scientific research to constructionist research with the help of rich data, an integrative Bayesian framework is proposed for systems prediction and intervention in high-dimensional network-based systems, which will provide ways to translate the unprecedented amount of heterogeneous data into reproducible scientific knowledge in a cumulative manner with novel concepts of objective-based uncertainty quantification and optimal experiment design based on that. <br/><br/>The proposed knowledge-driven analytics has strong potential of transforming available diverse large-scale data for reproducible knowledge to drive life and materials science research. If successful, it can eventually lead to computational tools for more efficient experiment design to maximize the use of existing big data and speed up the process for effective disease therapeutics and new materials discovery. The interdisciplinary nature of this proposal promises to foster cross-fertilization of ideas between engineering, life science, and materials science through research and education. The broader impact of this proposal involves the integration of the proposed research with an educational plan: (1) to strengthen interactions with the collaborators in life and materials sciences. In addition to making all the tools and research outcomes from this project publicly available, the developed algorithms and tools, including necessary technical help, will be distributed to the collaborators for more effective collaboration; (2) to develop new courses interfacing engineering, mathematics, life and materials sciences and incorporate them into the engineering curriculum for education and research training of students at all levels, which will help the new generation of researchers to establish a broad and solid foundation for interdisciplinary research and prepare them with required skills to address real-world challenges. The courses will be available across campus to attract female and minority students who are interested in research in science and engineering; (3) to involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the research in this interdisciplinary field with the efforts to increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering through the collaborations with the REU programs and other scholarship programs developed to increase diversity at Texas A&M University (TAMU). <br/><br/>The scientific focus of this proposal is solving mathematical and computational problems that exist in high-dimensional network-based systems prediction and intervention with uncertain models. The following open problems will be addressed: (1) to develop a network-based Bayesian framework and methods for systematic analysis of heterogeneous data sets; (2) to define novel objective-based uncertainty quantification for assessing model uncertainty and data significance to enable cumulative analytics to improve systems understanding and optimize future experiment design; (3) to derive optimal Bayesian experiment design based on uncertainty quantification for different operational objectives, which can lead to the maximal use of existing data and effective future experiment design and systems intervention; and (4) to apply the developed methodologies for understanding and treating specific diseases, for example, cancer and type 1 diabetes; as well as designing experiments for new materials discovery in an efficient way, in collaboration with the collaborators in life and materials sciences, which will translate the knowledge to practical applications. This project will lay out the foundation for translating existing data into systems understanding of life, disease, and man-made systems to gain deeper insights and direct them to desirable systems behavior to benefit human society."

The aim is to develop VR techniques that are more effective and more time-efficient for training than real-world exercises and VR systems that emulate them. To demonstrate the general effectiveness of these new VR training techniques, the research focuses on two training domains: (1) Robotic operating room tasks for non-surgeon team members, including preoperative setup, intraoperative tasks, and postoperative cleanup. (2) Pre-shift inspections of off-highway trucks, which include walk-around inspections, mounting the vehicle, and in-cab inspections. Formative expert reviews, studies comparing the new techniques to traditional VR training versions, and real-world validation studies will be used to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the techniques.  Educational activities include a graduate VR course, research experiences for undergraduates, a summer research program for underrepresented high school students, an annual VR summer camp for high and middle school students, and the creation of online video tutorials for VR development to support formal and informal learning.<br/><br/>A new framework for designing and analyzing VR training techniques has been developed to facilitate this research, the Framework for Altering Fidelity to Influence Memory.  It connects two concepts, system fidelity and working memory. System fidelity is the objective degree of exactness with which real world experiences are reproduced by a VR system. Working memory is the temporal activation of short-term or long-term perceptual, cognitive, and motor memory networks in the mind of the human user. The premise of the framework is to manipulate an aspect of system fidelity to help a stage of working memory, which in turn should improve the effectiveness of training. Six novel VR techniques, based on approaches identified with this framework, will be developed and investigated:  (1) causation signaling, (2) sensory accents,  (3) situational dramatization, (4) error instigation, (5) object conjuration, and (6) regulated biomechanics.  For example, the causation signaling method is to purposefully alter time and physics to convey the cause-and-effect relationship between an event and its consequence.  Time warping is a causation signaling technique in which the training scenario can be fast-forwarded after an error to the resulting consequence and then rewound back to the decision point just before the error. This technique will convey to the user the cause-and-effect relationship between the error and resulting consequence, in addition to allowing the user to correct the mistake."

Many buildings in the world are still in operation after centuries amid numerous renovation efforts. This long operational phase represents the majority of a building's lifecycle, yet the information regarding maintenance and renovation is rarely kept up to date. Building Information Models (BIMs) can alleviate this data shortage by centrally storing this data. However, even with a BIM, building updates are not kept due to the difficulty of continuous manual updates over a building's lifetime. This project will create a method to automatically update a BIM by exploiting recent advancements in machine vision. This automation process can systematically and continuously analyze the built environment, detecting changes from a previous assessment. It can distill and update the critical building information with minimal human error and effort. This research will result in a fundamental change in construction record keeping and benefit building operators by enabling maintenance and renovation activities to more easily be planned throughout a building's lifetime. The findings of this work will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate educational modules. Videos created for YouTube will also be developed to attract high school and underrepresented persons to a career in civil engineering.<br/><br/>The project will generate contextual-data relationships for use by an active illumination range camera-based, machine-vision system for automatically updating a BIM database with construction changes and leveraging metadata distilled from BIM object-oriented database models, the Computer-Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) database, and expert knowledge input by human operators. The project will tackle several intellectual challenges.  A primary challenge resides in the machine vision component of the work, which will need to provide additional meta-data beyond a 3D geometric model of an object, pushing the boundary of machine vision for the context of civil engineering systems. Another challenge is to extend data modeling capabilities for the built environment. Specifically, capabilities to translate meta-data from machine vision to identify and obtain meaningful contextual data that is specific for the objects will be created. A specific logical component, the Contextual Decision Maker (CDM), will also be developed to merge meta-data from multiple data sources. Finally, the entire system will be tested in an indoor renovation project to provide a realistic machine-learning process that will grow more robust over time."

The project investigates new automated software verification techniques and tools, that are more efficient and applicable to a wider range of programs and properties. Specifically, the project develops novel techniques for computing Craig interpolants, which are logical means for synthesizing proofs of correctness. The emphasis is on exploring the question of computing optimal interpolants---the simplest possible ones. The work is motivated by the observation that simpler interpolants are more likely to generalize to a proof of correctness. The goal of the project is to develop an algorithmic foundation for efficient verification of complex programs and correctness properties, thus expanding the applicability of formal verification techniques."

During this Cretaceous period, the Ontong-Java-Nui (OJN) volcanic outpouring also occurred, creating a large plateau (1/100 of Earth's area) that eventually split apart. With no reversals of the magnetic field to generate the characteristic crustal anomalies that allow scientists to track tectonic plate motions, it has not been possible to understand the cause-effect relation between this deep magmatic generation and the change in plate motion at the surface. While satellite measurements provide broad indication of seafloor structure, it is not possible to discern the narrow abyssal hills that would have formed at the fast spreading centers that controlled the plateau breakup. More detailed seafloor mapping and sampling are required. Undergraduate and graduate students will receive training in marine geological data acquisition during this study and some will participate in  post-cruise analysis via class projects. Podcasts of a research seminar will extend the reach of the new knowledge.<br/><br/>The OJN breakup is hypothesized to have occurred via spreading at the Osbourn Trough, along unmapped spreading centers in the Ellice Basin. Like other early Cretaceous oceanic plateaus, the OJN seems to have formed near a triple junction. Better understanding of Pacific tectonics during the Cretaceous normal superchron should shed light on the connections between oceanic plateau formation, breakup, plate reorganizations and associations with mantle plumes. In addition, paleolatitude data from the super-plateau remnants can to be tied to a common Pacific reference frame to refine the Pacific apparent polar wander path, which will then be compared with the Indo-Atlantic reference frame to determine the relative contributions from hotspot drift and true polar wander. Understanding evolution of OJN-linked processes is a long-term undertaking. This study takes the first step in this process with a multibeam survey of the Ellice Basin that will combine mapping of the central parts of this large basin where extinct spreading centers are likely to be located and remnants of fracture zones can be easily discerned. Coupled with selective dredging and Ar dating of basaltic rocks, as well as existing samples from IODP Site U1365 near Osbourn Trough, it will be possible to determine the timing of the inferred change in spreading direction, termination of Ellice Basin spreading, and the end of rifting along the Osbourn Trough."

Many buildings in the world are still in operation after centuries amid numerous renovation efforts. This long operational phase represents the majority of a building's lifecycle, yet the information regarding maintenance and renovation is rarely kept up to date. Building Information Models (BIMs) can alleviate this data shortage by centrally storing this data. However, even with a BIM, building updates are not kept due to the difficulty of continuous manual updates over a building's lifetime. This research will create a method to automatically update a BIM by exploiting recent advancements in machine vision. This automation process can systematically and continuously analyze the built environment, detecting changes from a previous assessment. It can distill and update the critical building information with minimal human error and effort. This research will result in a fundamental change in construction record keeping and benefit building operators by enabling maintenance and renovation activities to more easily be planned throughout a building's lifetime. The findings of this work will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate educational modules. Videos created for YouTube will also be developed to attract high school and underrepresented persons to a career in civil engineering.<br/><br/>The project will generate contextual-data relationships for use by an active illumination range camera-based, machine-vision system for automatically updating a BIM database with construction changes and leveraging metadata distilled from BIM object-oriented database models, the Computer-Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) database, and expert knowledge input by human operators. The project will tackle several intellectual challenges.  A primary challenge resides in the machine vision component of the work, which will need to provide additional meta-data beyond a 3D geometric model of an object, pushing the boundary of machine vision for the context of civil engineering systems. Another challenge is to extend data modeling capabilities for the built environment. Specifically, capabilities to translate meta-data from machine vision to identify and obtain meaningful contextual data that is specific for the objects will be created. A specific logical component, the Contextual Decision Maker (CDM), will also be developed to merge meta-data from multiple data sources. Finally, the entire system will be tested in an indoor renovation project to provide a realistic machine-learning process that will grow more robust over time."

Accordingly, harnessing the power and specificity of the immune system has enormous - and still largely untapped - potential to improve human health and wellbeing.  However, there remains an unmet need for technologies that enable precise and predictable ""programming"" of the correct type of immune response necessary to yield a desired outcome. The goal of this CAREER Award is to develop new synthetic materials for ""encoding"" immunological messages and tightly regulating their delivery to the organs, cells, and pathways of the immune system. In this project, the PI will engineer pathogen-mimicking polymer nanoparticles for connecting multiple immunological cues and controlling their delivery to the appropriate pathways of immune cells. This research will address a fundamental need for new tools to control, understand, and harness the immune system, which has significant ramifications in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and treatment of autoimmune disorders. Additionally, the PI will develop an educational outreach program that creates hands-on, inquiry-based lessons to catalyze active engagement in STEM areas by underprivileged students, while increasing awareness about vaccines, the immune system, and the importance of interdisciplinary science.<br/> <br/>Cells of the innate immune system sense invading pathogens or pathologic tissue using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are localized on the cell surface, in endosomal compartments, and in the cytosol. There is significant crosstalk between these pathways, and the integration of signals emanating from these receptors triggers and shapes the phenotype and magnitude of an immune response. Therefore, regulating the delivery of immunologic cues to multiple receptors localized throughout a cell is fundamental to controlling immunity. Yet, there is a lack of synthetic tools that can properly encode these physicochemically diverse cues to confer a desired immunological outcome.<br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER Award is to engineer a versatile nanoparticle-based platform for tightly regulating the delivery of molecularly defined activators of innate immune sensing pathways. The overall hypothesis is that polymer vesicles (i.e., polymersomes) engineered with precisely tunable pH-responsive and endosome-destabilizing activity will enable the coordinated delivery of multiple defined cues that trigger surface, endosomal, and cytosolic PRRs. The hypothesis will be tested and the objectives accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) engineer polymersomes with precisely tunable pH-responsive disassembly, release, and endosome destabilizing properties; 2) investigate the effect of polymersome properties on the activity of PRR agonists delivered alone or in combination; 3) demonstrate that polymersomes loaded with multiple PRR agonists can be used to program the magnitude and phenotype of an immune response. The proposed research will lead to the following impactful scientific and technological outcomes: 1) the development of materials that will expand the repertoire of druggable targets for immunomodulation; 2) fundamental knowledge of how materials can be designed to coordinate signaling events originating from diverse receptors localized throughout the cell; and 3) elucidation of new material-dependent synergies between PRRs that can be exploited to enhance and shape immune responses to vaccines. By integrating the synthesis of novel and rationally designed materials with fundamental studies elucidating new structure-activity relationships, the proposed research will have intellectual merit within the biomaterials, biopharmaceutical, and immunology communities.<br/><br/>To enhance the broader impacts of this CAREER Award, an integrated research, education, and outreach program will be developed to 1) train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in bioengineering research; 2) create and broadly disseminate hands-on, inquiry-based educational science lessons for middle and high school classrooms; 3) catalyze active and authentic engagement in STEM subjects by underrepresented and/or underprivileged middle and high school students; 4) increase awareness about vaccines, the immune system, and the importance of interdisciplinary teams in solving grand challenges in health care. In collaboration with the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt (SSMV) and the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science (VSVS), a 'students teaching students' initiative will be launched to develop an inexpensive, hands-on, mobile lesson kit for middle and high school students in Nashville public schools and rural Tennessee communities."

For example, understanding what a dog is can involve information not only about how the dog looks and acts, but also about how it sounds, feels, and even smells. Consequently, one sense, such as hearing, can exert an influence on processing in another, such as vision. There has been some suggestion from prior research that this is why deaf children often struggle to process some types of visual information. However, this may not be due to a direct effect of lack of hearing on vision. Deaf children often have delayed exposure to language, which may also influence how children's visual processing develops. The effects of language exposure and auditory deprivation can be disentangled by studying deaf children who are exposed to a natural visual language - American Sign Language. This project will provide information about how hearing and language influence vision during development, and will also provide information about how deaf children come to learn about the world around them.<br/><br/>One hundred and fifty deaf children aged 6-13 years, who vary in both their hearing loss and their exposure to American Sign Language, will be followed longitudinally for 2-3 years. During the first wave of data collection, each child's audiological profile, ASL skills and language background, and nonverbal IQ will be assessed. At each of four waves of data collection, their ability to process sequential streams of visual information will be measured. Moderation analyses will be used to determine the effects of hearing loss and natural language exposure and skill on the development of this visual processing ability. In doing so, the researchers will be able to test competing hypotheses about the basis for visual sequence processing deficits in deaf children."

Real materials at low temperatures still offer unexplored territory where the laws of physics and the emerging fundamental particles can differ significantly from the original building blocks of electrons and atoms.  Spin liquids form one such exotic class of systems.  They originate in insulating materials, which can be thought of as electrons frozen in place, with only their magnetic moments (spins) able to flip. At very low temperatures, spin-liquid physics emerges, which enables these materials to carry heat and spin currents, as if they were metals.  An intuitive way to think about that situation is to imagine electrons that have split in half, leaving their charge half stuck to the lattice, while the magnetic half has become mobile. These fractional particles, as they are called, could possibly be exploited to enable quantum computation. Spin-liquid systems are a challenge to theorists, and require new ways of thinking. Developing and testing these new methods requires a continuous conversation between theoretical and experimental research. Spin liquids are rare both experimentally and theoretically, especially in models that can be connected to real materials. This project supports theoretical research in examining how to stabilize these spin liquids in a wide variety of models that can be realized in materials.  The research will lead to the development of a new toolbox that would make it easier to study these exotic systems both numerically and experimentally. Moreover, these ideas could be extended to develop new ways to exploit related phenomena in other systems, which include high-temperature superconductors.<br/><br/>This award also supports outreach and educational efforts that are closely integrated with the research. The educational component aims towards facilitating the conversation between condensed matter experimentalists and theorists by developing a course module of condensed matter theory designed primarily for experimental graduate students.

Spin liquids are exotic magnetic phases that break no symmetries, fluctuate strongly at zero temperature, and have fractional mobile collective excitations that carry only the spin of the electron. These spinons can have strange particle statistics making them of interest for quantum computation. However, spin liquids are rarely found in nature, which is a major impediment to theoretically understanding and eventually exploiting their diverse behavior. Highly frustrated magnetic lattices are promising places to look for spin liquids, however, there is competition from neighboring ordered phases, making spin liquid regions narrow, or even nonexistent. This project will develop methods to stabilize spin liquids by weakly coupling extra degrees of freedom to frustrated lattices in order to exploit their fluctuating nature. The initial subprojects tackle magnetic degrees of freedom, where extra spins are added to a frustrated lattice in ways that favor the spin liquid. These begin with a honeycomb lattice coupled to spins in the center of the hexagons, and then explore how to most effectively couple in extra spins, and even how to use this coupling to select different spin liquids. Other degrees of freedom are: orbital, where increased orbital degeneracy can be stabilized by strong spin-orbit coupling, leading to increased quantum fluctuations; structural, where low-energy local phonons can couple strongly to the spins by modifying the superexchange paths, again increasing the fluctuations; or optical, where gapless spinons interacting with a periodic laser pulse can acquire a gap. Model Hamiltonians involving each of these degrees of freedom will be studied both analytically and with large-scale numerical calculations to determine how the phase boundaries change with the coupling, and how to engineer maximally stable spin liquids. Promising approaches will be used to propose new candidate materials. This research program will open up access to a diverse set of spin liquids in which to develop and test new theoretical ideas, as well as improve our understanding of spin liquids by understanding their fluctuations. Understanding spin liquids is fundamentally important, as they are at the vanguard of new strongly correlated physics and are deeply intertwined with unconventional superconductivity and heavy fermions.<br/><br/>This award also supports outreach and educational efforts that are closely integrated with the research.

Risk assessment of nanotechnology to humans or the environment, resulting from increased accumulations of engineered nanoparticles in aquatic systems, is currently impeded by the difficulty in differentiating engineered nanoparticles from naturally occurring nanoparticles and quantifying engineered nanoparticle exposure concentrations and properties. This CAREER award aims to develop methods to discern engineered and natural nanoparticles and to measure the concentration and properties of engineered nanoparticles in the natural environment. <br/><br/>This CAREER award will develop a multi-method analytical platform capable of discerning engineered nanoparticles from natural nanoparticles based on differences in their physicochemical properties such as size, morphology, chemical composition, elemental/isotopic ratios, and/or combinations of these properties. The hypothesis is that engineered nanoparticles possess significantly different physicochemical properties, relative to natural nanoparticles, which will enable detection and quantification engineered nanoparticles in complex matrices. The multi-method approach includes field flow fractionation coupled with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy, single particle-ICP-MS and transmission electron microscopy coupled with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy techniques and methodologies. In particular, the research will evaluate the capability of these methods to identify subtle differences in physicochemical properties of engineered versus natural nanoparticles to: 1) enable detection and quantification of engineered nanoparticles, 2) determine applicability and limitations of these methods for engineered nanoparticle analysis in surface waters, 3) perform analysis of engineered nanoparticles in surface waters receiving effluents from waste treatment plants, and 4) apply the multi-method approach for monitoring of engineered nanoparticles in surface waters in collaboration with the USGS.<br/><br/>The outcomes of the proposed research will impact other disciplines such as aquatic toxicology and environmental nanoscience and engineering. Quantifying concentrations and properties of engineered nanoparticles in surface waters will affect engineered nanoparticle hazard and risk characterization by focusing on the form of engineered nanoparticles after their transformations in the environment. Also, measuring the concentrations and properties of engineered nanoparticles in surface waters will enable validation of engineered nanoparticles fate models. The outcome of the proposed research will also inform federal agencies (e.g. EPA, NIST, and USGS) and industry on nanoparticle regulation and best safety practices.<br/><br/>To integrate research, education and service, the PI will: 1) develop undergraduate and graduate lectures and courses in environmental nanoscience, 2) edit books that can be used as text book material, 3) enhance undergraduate, graduate, and high school laboratory and field experiences, 4) develop a professional training program for high school teachers, 5) enhance high school students awareness of nanotechnology and the opportunities and challenges it may offer, 6) train students on reviewing proposals, 7) involve students in grants development and writing, and 7) organize the FFF2018 symposium, and a meeting and discussion of high school student with international researchers."

The statistical analysis, in turn, relies on assumptions which, if violated, can lead to incorrect or misleading outcomes. In many modern applications, the statistical modeling is further complicated by inherent structural inhomogeneities in the population. Specific examples include the spread of information in social networks, genetic variation among mitochondrial DNA sequences from different species, collisions of particles suspended in a non-uniform medium, and identification of suspicious activity in a criminal or terrorist network. With these applications in mind, the project initiates a systematic study of probabilistic models and inferential principles for data taken from heterogeneous or specially structured populations. Attainment of these goals requires techniques from several mathematical and scientific areas and should lead to progress at the intersection of applied science, statistics, probability, and mathematics. Project outcomes will lead to a better understanding of how fundamental statistical assumptions affect the validity of scientific conclusions. The mathematical theory and statistical methods developed should have a broad societal impact, as combinatorial stochastic processes are used throughout modern applications in physical, biological, and social sciences, national security, and beyond. The PI has extensive plans for training graduate and undergraduate students in the methods to be used, via courses on the foundations of statistics at both levels, the supervision of Ph.D. theses, and conferences and workshops on these topics for these and other early-career researchers. The plans are innovative and the PI will devote significant time and resources to them. In particular, a strong emphasis will be placed on attracting and hiring students from underprivileged backgrounds who are first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The specific technical objective is a rigorous mathematical theory for understanding random structures that exhibit relative exchangeability and other invariance principles.  A hallmark of the project is the in-depth study and rigorous development of theory and applications for edge exchangeable network models, which were first introduced by the PI as a novel invariance principle for network analysis.  Desired outcomes include relative invariance principles, structural properties, and characterization theorems for evolving combinatorial structures. The project will also exploit deep connections between combinatorics, algebra, logic, and probability theory to refine prior work by de Finetti, Kingman, Aldous, Hoover, and Kallenberg, on graph limits and Levy-Ito-type representations of Feller processes on combinatorial state spaces. Theoretical developments should guide methodological advances in specific applications, including climate science, network science, and phylogenetics."

All of the biological complexity of an organism is encoded within its genome. One of the greatest challenges in science today is understanding how the ""syntax"" of the genome gives rise to the ""semantics"" of biological function and, indeed, all life on Earth. The theory of evolution offers a way forward. These seemingly heterogeneous biological features are merely facets of the common evolutionary process by which they arose. By querying their phylogeny, or evolutionary history, we can begin to decipher the living language in which genomes are written and, ultimately, master it for our own purposes.<br/><br/>Today, phylogenies are primarily reconstructed by computational analysis of biomolecular sequence data. Crucially, state-of-the-art algorithms treat genomes as an unordered bag of observations, not as an ordered sequence of observations. This assumption is made for pure mathematical convenience. In contrast, DNA is a linear molecule, the information encoded in the genome is understood to be sequential, and its order matters greatly. Recombination is one of the major evolutionary processes that rearranges genomes over time, ultimately shaping the sequential ordering of information. Sequence dependence due to recombination (or the lack thereof) is an essential aspect of the computational problem of phylogenetic inference, and yet the common assumption that loci (positions in the genome) are independent and identically distributed remains a major methodological gap.<br/><br/>To address this critical need, this project will create new evolutionary models and algorithms for inferring species phylogenies from genomes while accounting for point mutations, genetic drift, and recombination. A connection is then forged to systems biology by building the new evolutionary models into a new computational method for mapping the genomic architecture of complex phenotypes (observable traits). The new methods will be validated using an extensive performance study incorporating empirical and synthetic data. Analyses of the empirical data are anticipated to result in new biological discoveries such as understanding the genetic basis of adaptive traits in house mouse, the most widely used laboratory organism.<br/><br/>This project incorporates significant educational and outreach components. The new mathematical models, algorithms, and tools proposed in the research objectives will be the basis for two workshop series: one targeted to evolutionary computation researchers and the other to evolutionary biologists. Interdisciplinary training at the undergraduate and graduate level includes underrepresented minority students. Open implementations of all methods and data will be publicly available through a collaborative online community. <br/><br/>This project entails three integrated research objectives. First, algorithms for inferring species phylogenies under a new combined model of point mutations, genetic drift, and recombination will be developed. The combined model unites the coalescent model of population genetics with a hidden Markov model to capture varying degrees of sequence dependence among neighboring loci due to recombination. A key challenge is scalability, which is addressed using new approximation algorithms. Second, the new evolutionary models will be fused with a linear mixed model to capture dependence between genomic loci and a trait encoded by causal loci within the genome. The new models will be the basis for new algorithms that address several related problems in functional genomics. One application is association mapping, which seeks to infer causal loci based upon significant correlation between allele frequencies and observed trait values. Third, a performance study will be conducted to validate the new computational methodologies."

As a typical example of on-demand economy, ride-sourcing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, are transforming the taxi industry and the way we travel in cities. The companies provide ride-hailing applications that intelligently source private car owners who drive their own vehicles to provide taxi services for profit to riders. These companies have been successful, but have created controversy. This controversy arises due to regulations in terms of price, entry and service quality that are imposed on the taxis while comparatively fewer regulatory requirements have been imposed on ride-sourcing companies. Unfair competition is argued particularly by cab drivers and their employers. The success of ride-sourcing services has thus created doubt about the efficacy of regulating the taxi industry; it challenges the very premise behind regulation in this industry. This grant will develop methodologies and tools for analyzing the structure and competition of taxi markets with ride-sourcing services and deriving insights on their regulation. The grant will provide timely support for the government agencies of many cities to better understand the impacts and implications of ride-sourcing companies and develop policies to guide their deployment. The research results can also shed light on the analysis and management of other types of on-demand economy and other emerging urban mobility services such as car sharing and ridesharing. This grant will involve students at all levels and traditionally underrepresented students, creating interactive, virtual environments for in-class use.  Additionally, materials related to an on-demand economy and innovative urban mobility services will be developed to enhance existing courses. <br/><br/>The research will be conducted in two main thrusts. The first aims to develop an analytical framework to investigate optimal regulation regimes of a taxi market with ride-sourcing companies under simplified aggregate or macroscopic settings. Representing the matchings between customers and drivers by an exogenous matching function, the equilibrium properties of an aggregate taxi market will be examined under different market structures to derive insights on whether it is necessary or how to regulate the market. The aggregate model will be extended to network and dynamic contexts to better capture the spatial and temporal variability of the supply and demand of taxi services. The second thrust develops an agent-based simulation and a simulated test bed to provide a better understanding of the working mechanisms of ride-sourcing platforms, validate the analytical results obtained from developed models, and test various regulations and policies for more complex cases that are  analytically intractable. If successful, this grant will advance the knowledge of and analysis capabilities for taxi markets. It will enrich the literature of transportation systems analysis, network modeling and agent-based simulation and modeling."

Parents share extensive personal information about their children on social media sites, often starting before their children are even born. As a result, children are now growing up with their online identities formed and shaped from birth through adulthood. However, upon becoming adults, they have little ability to revise or remove what has already been posted about them online. Furthermore, computational advancements like tagging, facial recognition, and voice recognition enable searching and indexing of personal data, yet provide little support for families to make decisions about how that data should be preserved, accessed, or controlled. This work casts a lens on children's online identities as part of a complex sociotechnical system that is formed and shaped by parents, extended familial and social networks, technology companies, policy makers, and children themselves. <br/><br/>This project will first investigate 1) what information families share about children online; 2) how families think about past identities and future identities being available online; and 3) technology companies' data management and archival practices around children. It will then 4) design and develop prototypes that support families making preservation, access, and control decisions about children's online identities. This research program bridges advances in computation, human-computer interaction, and social computing. It addresses numerous conceptual and technical challenges, including how to support preservation and access decisions about children's identities online, and how to support children's ownership of their own online identities as they grow up.

Newspapers report melting polar ice caps, warming lakes and oceans, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, expanding polar vortices, worsening droughts, and intensifying super typhoons. In the face of this, all nations, including the United States, are strategizing how best to evaluate, adjust, and plan. Doing so, however, is complicated by the fact that although change is global, its effects are experienced and responded to locally. How people perceive the environment and its effects on their lives is mediated by culture, language, and geography. Thus effective planning requires understanding not only global forces but also local variability and the response diversity it produces.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will investigate response diversity in the Philippines, a microcosm of environmental shifts. The Philippines has been struck by a series of super typhoons of increasing frequency and intensity, including Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, the strongest hurricane to hit landfall in recorded human history. The Philippines also faces altered hurricane paths, rising sea levels, sinking islands, mass species extinctions, erratic flooding, and droughts. It is the simultaneity of these developments and the pervasive public awareness that has resulted, all in a single, relatively small arena, that makes the Philippines an illuminating site for investigating responses to environmental change. The research will be carried out by University of California, Los Angeles, doctoral candidate, Bradley Cardozo, under the supervision of Dr. Jessica R. Cattelino. Cardozo will focus on two different groups with contrasting responses to the environmental crisis:  (1) an urban-based political organization, and (2) a rural farming cooperative whose formerly landless peasant members are now experimenting with organic farming and clean energy technologies. Cardozo  will employ a combination of ethnographic research methods, including participant observation in the daily lives and activities of group members; structured and semi-structured interviews; and sustained cultural immersion over the six months to be spent at each site. Using text analysis software, he will catalogue his observations, interviews, and recordings, identify themes, and chart key words and phrases, to delineate the most salient and consequential features of these different responses to common experiences. Cardozo's findings will contribute to improved social scientific understanding of how people's varying perceptions and experiences interact with common events.  Much attention has been focused on the destructive physical effects of the extreme weather phenomena connected to environmental change; this project seeks to document and understand the social and cultural aftermath, as well, and thereby to identify lessons for planners everywhere."

When combined with cutting-edge results in modern context such as random matrix theory, matrix concentration, and convex geometry, these classical theory will lead to novel principled methods for a general class of problems ranging from high dimensional regression and classification to network data analysis and subspace learning. All methods developed in the proposed research will be implemented as standard R packages freely available and will have high pedagogical value and will be used to develop new courses.

This exceptional data set will be used to study the strength of the tectonic plate.  The gravity data and seafloor maps record the downward bending of the tectonic plate when volcanos are built on it.  Models will be used to simulate this bending and provide an estimate of the strength of the tectonic plate.  The results will complement, or could even revise, results produced by experimental methods in which the strength of rock samples is measured in the laboratory.  The project will contribute to the understanding of earthquakes which requires an understanding of rock strength. The project will also contribute to the professional training of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced STEM fields.  In addition, a graduate student seminar will be developed whose topic will be on the strength of the plate, and guest lectures will be given remotely via Skype and made available on iTunes University and YouTube sites.<br/><br/>Rheologic properties of the Pacific Ocean lithosphere will be investigated along the older section of the Hawaiian Ridge.  In this area, volcanoes of different sizes have erupted on crust of roughly the same age (about 85 Ma).  This will allow the researchers to isolate the effect of the size of the load and age of the load from the effect of the thermal age of the lithosphere in their models of the lithosphere response to the loads. The researchers will use multibeam bathymetry and gravity data collected in this region to quantify the rheological laws that control the flexure of the underlying lithosphere and thus, characterize the strength of the lithosphere.  This study could motivate revisions to our understanding of lithosphere rheology overall."

The proposed approach to this problem is a rigorous mathematical treatment for laminar-to-turbulence transition and then an extension of these concepts to fully turbulent flows. The results of this research could have an impact on engineering and technology applications where turbulence is important, and this means most of the flows that surround us and most of the flows in the process industry.<br/><br/>Recent research has shown that exact coherent structures in the form of unstable equilibria, traveling waves, and periodic orbits can be computed precisely for moderately turbulent shear flows, by treating well-resolved numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations as very high-dimensional dynamical systems. These invariant solutions capture the form and behavior of coherent structures observed in experiment and simulation since the 1950s, and they suggest an approach for leveraging ideas from dynamical systems theory to exploit the inherent low-dimensionality of self-organized structures in turbulent shear flows. The goals of the proposed research are to develop these ideas into a rigorous understanding of the structure and dynamics of turbulence at moderate Reynolds numbers, and to extend successes of this approach to high Reynolds numbers. Specific objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to develop a comprehensive database of exact coherent structures for pressure-driven channel flow, from moderate to high Reynolds numbers, and (2) to rigorously derive quantitatively accurate and predictive reduced-order models of turbulent shear flow based on the dynamics of these structures. Successful achievement of these objectives will form the basis for a precise spatiotemporal understanding of momentum and vorticity transport and turbulent energy production in wall-bounded shear flows, and will demonstrate the utility of exact coherent structures and high-dimensional dynamical systems theory in analyzing turbulence. There are also plans to modernize the computational mathematics curriculum in New Hampshire and bring the teaching of Julia (the hybrid computing language to be used in the proposed research) into the classroom."

There is a dramatic shortage of high school physics teachers who have a degree in physics and count themselves as physics specialists.  This problem is more acute in poorer and rural areas of the country. This project will address this issue in rural North-East Texas by building a community of physics students and teachers from local high schools, and community colleges. This community would provide support for students in the physics education degree. The community will focus on a shared activity; development of teaching materials to address physics concepts most students find difficult. These materials will be made freely available, and will help support both physics education majors and high school physics teachers, and lead to increased production of physics teachers. <br/><br/>The goal of the project will be to create a community of practice from participants in a number of recently implemented projects related to teacher education in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Curriculum and Instruction. The projects will include the switch of calculus-based physics courses to studio mode and the creation of a learning assistant program in those classes, a new Master's program in Physics for in-service high school physics teachers, and the Texas Teacher Residency Program which provides stipends for students to be placed in STEM classrooms with mentor teachers while obtaining an education Masters. A Teacher-in-Residence (TIR) will help the project team build the community from students and teachers involved in these projects, and will base the community around the creation of educational materials for high school physics and college introductory physics courses which address areas of conceptual difficulty, provide communal teaching resources, and provide opportunities for participants to perform action research in their classrooms to measure the learning outcomes of those modules. This project will also continue the ongoing reformation the physics teacher preparation program at Texas A&M-Commerce to allow physics teachers to efficiently complete the program via courses that use best practice pedagogy, and to lower barriers to recruitment. The ultimate goal will be to develop a community of teachers and students informed by physics education research with access to free teaching materials, and ultimately increase the supply of physics-degree holding teachers in the state of Texas."

The novel twist here is that plants mediate interactions among different trophic levels, determining how a plant parasite affects a plant predator and vice versa. The research will have direct application to the management and recovery of two rare species: the hemiparasite is federally listed as threatened and the herbivore is an endangered butterfly. The investigators will partner with federal and state agencies to restore both species. This research will also provide research training to a post-doctoral research associate, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student. All will be actively mentored in responsible conduct of research, field and lab data collection, analysis, and outreach. <br/><br/>The organisms used in this study co-occur in grasslands of the Pacific Northwest US.

Hemiparasitism will be manipulated among plants, and herbivores will be allowed to feed on the hemiparasites in a subset of the mesocosms. Hemiparasite survival, biomass, and secondary chemistry will be measured to determine how they are affected by host community composition, and herbivore performance will be related to host plant community and to hemiparasite resources. Stable isotopes will be used to track fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from the host plant community to the hemiparasites, and through the hemiparasites to their herbivores. The research will exploit an ecologically understudied situation in which plants function both as producers and as consumers to provide new insights into how multi-trophic interactions structure ecosystems."

One way microbes could enhance plant coexistence is through negative plant-soil feedbacks: Plants often accumulate species-specific pathogens in their roots and soils. As a plant species increases in number, so do their pathogens, which limits unrestricted growth and can be a mechanism to allow coexistence of many plant species. This mechanism has been tested in the greenhouse, but we have little knowledge of its importance in nature. This research aims to investigate plant-soil feedbacks and its consequences for competition and coexistence between plant species by first testing it in the greenhouse, and then examining it in a field experiment. New projects that focus on culturing and sequencing the fungal associates of plants in the field and greenhouse experiments will answer questions such as: Which microbes are most important in plant-soil feedbacks? What are their effects on plant hosts? Are these effects dependent on climate? The results of these investigations will shed light on the drivers of coexistence in two foundational arid-land grasses, and will be shared with land managers to improve stewardship. This research will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, as well as increase public understanding of arid-land ecosystems via summer camp experiences for school children and outreach.<br/>Substantial theory and mechanistic models predict that plant-microbe interactions contribute to species coexistence, and greenhouse experiments show considerable evidence of microbe-driven plant-soil feedback (PSF). However, field tests of the role of PSF in long term vegetation dynamics are critical to determining the relative importance of PSF compared to other mechanisms of coexistence, such as spatial abiotic niche variation, operating in nature. Dissertation work fills that gap by linking the strengths of PSF (measured in field experiments) to decades-long variation in the stability of coexistence. Proposed improvements will resolve questions that have arisen from dissertation work by characterizing the belowground mechanisms of PSF using next-generation sequencing methods and targeted greenhouse inoculation of fungal cultures. Results will advance knowledge by increasing the ability to scale plant-microbe interactions from the greenhouse to the field, resolving the degree to which fungal community composition explains vegetation dynamics over spatial and temporal scales, and determining the ecological roles of a poorly understood group of fungi (dark septate endophytes), which has the potential to revolutionize current paradigms on how plants respond to abiotic stress."

Each year, we have seen growing attendance and submissions. <br/><br/>The funds sought will be used to provide travel support for 10-15 students and post-docs, including women and minorities, to attend and present their work (oral or poster) at the workshop. Since young researchers, especially students and postdocs, tend to be the driving force behind successful interdisciplinary collaborations, we will dedicate most of the slots in the upcoming BDA meeting to works presented by students and postdocs. Our experience in the past BDA meetings shows that students and postdocs often have difficulty securing travel funds for such events, therefore we will encourage their participation by offering them generous travel grants. We hope to introduce young researchers to this exciting and emerging area of cross-disciplinary research, and help them establish collaborations for the future. <br/><br/>Distributed systems are prevalent in computer science and biology. Both domains rely on networks of interacting entities - molecules, cells, and organisms in biology; sensor, mobile, and autonomous robot devices in computer science - to coordinate output responses to inputs, route resources, and navigate through environments. Both types of systems also seek solutions to these problems that are inherently efficient, robust, and adaptive with respect to changes expected in natural and competitive environments. These connections suggest that by thinking computationally about the settings, requirements, and goals of information processing within distributed biological systems, we can achieve two complementary goals: First, we can use insights about how biological systems solve computational problems to aid in designing more flexible, robust, and adaptive distributed algorithms. Second, we can use, develop, or adapt existing distributed computing theory to help understand the behavior of biological systems and propose new, testable hypotheses to determine how well such models fit the observed behavior of the biological system. By bringing together both biologists and computer scientists, we aim to cross-fertilize the important and timely ideas that both domains can offer to one another."

The summer school will take place July 27-30 and the workshop will take place August 1-5. Representation theory of finite groups is a very rich subject with connections to many areas of mathematics. The subject seeks to understand the ways in which an abstract collection of operators can be expressed as transformations on a space. Striking developments in this field have recently been made by researchers in Europe. A major aim of the scheduled events is to provide an opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and early-career researchers to learn about these developments directly from the sources. An additional aim is to facilitate new collaborations. This project will support the participation of US-based researchers (predominantly graduate students and recent PhDs) in the summer school and workshop.<br/><br/>The scientific focus of the summer school and workshop is the representation theory of finite groups and related algebraic structures, with an emphasis on the modular case. This is an active area of research in the US and abroad, with mathematicians on different continents working on different aspects of the subject. The summer school will be centered around four lecture series: Rational Cohomology and Support for Linear Algebraic Groups (Eric Friedlander); Group Actions via Homotopy Theory (Jesper Grodal); Local Representation Theory (Radha Kessar); and Endo-trivial Modules for Infinite Groups (Peter Symonds). Taken together, these topics cover a broad range of current research on modular representation theory of finite groups. The workshop will consist of twenty-three lectures by international scholars who are are known for their seminal contributions and for their ability to communicate mathematics effectively. The lectures from the summer school and workshop will be submitted for publication. The webpage for the summer school and workshop is http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/160727-psswgatartofg."

Crucial to this ability is the fact that one does not need to make perfectly accurate or fully detailed predictions to make good decisions. Though, due to our natural limitations, our predictions about the future are necessarily flawed, they are nevertheless sufficiently useful to make reasonable decisions. For artificial agents, in contrast, imperfect predictions often lead to catastrophic failures in decision making. Many existing approaches fundamentally assume that the agent will eventually learn to make perfect predictions and make perfect decisions, which is unreasonable in sufficiently rich, complex environments. This work considers the problem of developing artificial agents that are more aware of and more robust to their own limitations. Agents that can more robustly and flexibly learn from experience in truly complex environments have the potential to impact nearly any application in which decisions are made over time, for instance autonomous robots/vehicles, personal assistants, and medical/legal decision support. Furthermore, as the project will be undertaken at an undergraduate-only liberal arts college, undergraduate researchers will play an integral role in the work. The PI will also build on the strength of the liberal arts setting to enhance instruction of key discipline-specific research and writing skills throughout the Computer Science curriculum. Explicit development of these skills will not only improve students' preparation for a wide variety of career paths (including basic research) but is also aligned with best practices for broadening participation in the discipline. <br/><br/>This project studies model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) under the assumption that the agent has fundamental limitations that prevent it from learning a perfect model or from producing optimal plans. The central hypothesis is that in this context the MBRL problem cannot be decomposed into separate model-learning and planning problems, each treating the other as an idealized black box. Rather the optimization process for each component must be aware of its role in the overall architecture and of the limitations of its partner. One key aim of the work is to derive novel measures of model quality that are more tightly related to the true objective of control performance than standard measures of one-step prediction accuracy adapted from supervised learning settings. Another is to investigate how model learning objectives/algorithms can be adapted to account for the limitations of the specific planner that will use the model. Further, control algorithms will be investigated that can make effective use of models of non-homogeneous quality by mediating between model-based and model-free knowledge. The ultimate goal is to integrate these principles into novel MBRL agents that are significantly more robust to limitations in the model class and/or planner and are able to succeed in environments that are too complex and high-dimensional to be modeled or solved exactly."

Their shortcomings include limited choice of work materials, chemical hazards, and thermally induced defects on machined surfaces. This award supports a study of material removal in brittle materials by the impact of nano diamond particles. Research results can lead to a low cost alternative for nanomachining at room temperature without the shortcomings of existing nanomachining processes. The new process can improve the nanomachinability of a wide variety of both conductive and nonconductive materials, and may have applications in biomedical, electronic, automotive, energy, and metal working industries. Potential applications in these industries include nanostructured scaffolds for artificial tissue engineering, nanostructured switches and wireless transmitters, ultra-low friction layers for thermal barrier coatings, and nanostructured proton exchange membranes for fuel cells. <br/> <br/>The experimental platform for the new process is an atomic force microscope where workpiece is vibrated at the frequency of 20-160 kHz. Machining is achieved by the impact of loose nano diamond particles in liquid medium. The research objective is to understand effects of kinetic energy on material removal mechanism (plastic deformation or brittle fracture). The level of kinetic energy is determined by machining conditions (primarily diamond particle size and vibration frequency). The research plan consists of computer simulations and experimental studies. Extended finite element methods will be used to simulate the machining process. In these models, to mimic the impact given by the diamond particle on the workpiece at different kinetic energy levels, the workpiece is fixed and the diamond particle is treated as a vibrating rigid body (at the frequency of 20-160 kHz). Drucker-Prager constitutive law will be employed to describe the behavior of brittle materials. Finite element models will be validated by comparing model predictions with experimental results. Machining experiments using graphene, silicon, and glass samples will be performed at different levels of kinetic energy by varying the mean size of diamond particles (5, 10, 15 nm) and vibrating the workpiece at different frequencies in the range of 20-160 kHz. Machined surfaces will be examined using electron microscopy, and optical microscope to determine if the material removal is done by plastic deformation or brittle fracture."

Misalignment of the circadian clock with respect to 24-hour environmental cycles occurs after rapid travel across time zones and leads to symptoms of jet lag including sleep disturbances, digestive problems, and decreased cognitive performance. The circadian clock is highly conserved across animal species, and there are many similarities in the genes and neural circuits involved in the circadian systems of humans and the fruit fly Drosophila. The goal of this project is to obtain a mathematical understanding of the biology underlying jet lag by developing a detailed model of the circadian clock in Drosophila and then systematically analyzing how the clock is disrupted by sudden changes in the timing of the external light-dark cycle. The predictions of the computational model will then be tested in flies through experiments that simulate transmeridian travel. This project will also create new tools for building mathematical models directly from observed data by bringing together techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, and neuroscience. A unique graduate-level course at the intersection of these fields will be developed. Graduate, undergraduate, and community college students will be involved in this research and obtain interdisciplinary training. The undergraduate and community college students will form integrated summer research project teams. Community college students will be recruited to enroll in an undergraduate-level mathematical modeling course at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and will receive mentorship on pursuing four-year STEM degree program opportunities.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the interface between dynamical systems and statistical data analysis in the context of neuronal modeling. The research goal of this project is to develop novel data assimilation methodologies for inferring models of neuronal dynamics directly from time-course data that enable insights into biological mechanisms. Specifically, this project will create new data assimilation tools to identify and parameterize neurophysiological models from voltage traces recorded from the Drosophila circadian (~24-hour) clock network. This research effort will address two major gaps in the mathematical/computational neuroscience field: a scarcity of methods for inferring parameters of unobserved ionic currents from measurements of membrane voltage alone, and a lack of models that link molecular, cellular, and behavioral scales. This will be accomplished by developing a method to design stimulus protocols for use in data assimilation algorithms that optimally unmask the dynamics of unobservable neuronal variables and improve inference of electrophysiological models and parameters. The method will be used to build a model of the Drosophila clock network that links circadian rhythms in gene expression to changes in neuronal activity and behavioral outputs. These models will be used to analyze how the internal circadian oscillator re-entrains following phase shifts in the external light-dark cycle. More generally, this work aims to elucidate fundamental aspects of synchronization and entrainment in oscillatory systems."

However, a major challenge in T-cell therapy is off-tumor toxicity, in which T cells attack healthy tissues that display the same markers as tumor cells on their surfaces. Off-tumor toxicity can result in severe side effects, including patient deaths that have been observed in several clinical trials. This research proposal aims to reduce off-tumor toxicity by enabling T cells to interrogate the interior of a target cell before making a killing decision. This will be achieved by a new class of engineered proteins that are produced and delivered by T cells into target cells, but become toxic if and only if they encounter a tumor-specific protein inside the target cell. Successful development of the proposed technology will increase the safety and efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapy for cancer by improving the specificity of tumor targeting and by expanding the types of cancers that can be targeted. <br/><br/>The proposed study aims develop a new class of sense-and-respond protein devices?termed Cytoplasmic Antigen Detectors and Extermination Triggers (CADETs)?that enable T cells to search inside the target cell for disease markers prior to unleashing toxicity. CADETs will be constructed by accessorizing the cytotoxic protein granzyme B with regulatory domains that respond to specific intracellular oncoproteins, such as SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). A SENP1-responsive CADET has been constructed by rational design, in which an inhibitory domain blocks CADET?s enzymatic activity until it is cleaved off by SENP1. This architecture can be generalized to other tumor-associated proteases with well-defined cleavage targets. A high-throughput screening process will be developed to enable optimization of CADET molecules that respond to non-proteolytic ligands, such as hTERT. This fluorescence-based screening process will be performed in Pichia pastoris yeast cells, and top-performing CADET sequences will be characterized in primary human T cells for production and delivery efficiency as well as hTERT-activated toxicity. The optimal CADET molecule will be co-expressed with chimeric antigen receptors in T cells and evaluated for the ability to selectively kill oncoprotein-expressing tumor cells while sparing off-tumor target cells in mice. In partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica (SMBGC), this proposal will also develop an outreach program for children between the ages of 12 and 14 to introduce the proposed research and discuss potential paths to future careers in engineering. The proposed technology combines synthetic biology and T-cell engineering to address an important biomedical challenge, and it will serve as an exciting demonstration of the possibilities that an engineering career could offer."

The biogeophysical characteristics associated with tall shrub expansion near streams could potentially explain the documented increases in carbon and nutrient export from large Arctic rivers through the underlying processes of widespread permafrost degradation and increased subsurface flow. Additionally, occurrences of tall shrubs could be used as a readily measured proxy for subsurface properties both across space and time using remote sensing. If our observations hold true in other stream environments, the information has the potential to provide novel hydrological, permafrost, and biological process insights to complement the extensive literature on increasing Arctic shrub cover. Preliminary measurements of differential runoff in Arctic tundra link tall shrubs along riparian corridors to losing stream sections (streams with decreasing discharge downstream), whereas gaining or maintaining stream sections (increasing discharge downstream) lack tall shrubs.<br/><br/>This award will support measurements to test whether the formation of a talik (permafrost-free ground) and a downward hydrologic gradient creates a biogeochemical subsurface environment that favors shrub recruitment and growth, which, in turn, results in patterns of tall shrub distribution coinciding along losing stream reaches.

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects. The corresponding equations contain integro-differential operators that are highly nonlinear, singular and with degenerating coefficients. Integro-differential equations of this type have received increased attention recently: well-posedness and regularity theory are being developed since many new applications have emerged, among which conformal geometry, stochastic control and image processing. The project aims at advancing knowledge in the theories of kinetic equations, nonlocal integro-differential operators and degenerate differential operators."

Previous studies have underlined the potential of this region to document early dispersals of modern humans, Neandertals and perhaps Denisovans along the Eurasian steppe belt. It is assumed, however, that it was particularly challenging for incoming human groups to adapt to the Late Pleistocene environmental setting. Starting from about 120,000 years ago and until the end of the Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, the climate became increasingly unstable with sharp changes in temperature and moisture occurring at an accelerating pace. Hence some scholars have suggested that the peopling of regions with continental climate, such as Mongolia, would be highly dependent on the global variation in temperature and moisture. Climate improvements would favor demographic increases among human populations and trigger range expansions into territories that remained out of reach during the coldest periods. Other scholars argued that humans have been able to cope with challenging environments in most regions of Eurasia before the Late Pleistocene and climate change would have only little effect on population dynamics. These different views illustrate a lack of consensus regarding the impact that climate change had on the peopling of regions such as Europe, Central and Northeast Asia where human responses to such constraints are still poorly understood. The research holds broad significance because it sets within a deep chronological context the interaction between human behavior and climate variability.<br/><br/>Dr. Zwyns and his research team will address this issue by building up a high-resolution archeological and environmental sequence for North Mongolia. The research includes targeted excavations and sample collection at Paleolithic sites located along the tributaries of the Selenga River. The Selenga flows to the Northeast and connects Mongolia with Lake Baikal. Its drainage system has yielded the highest concentration of relevant archeological sites in Mongolia and in Siberia and holds one of the richest records for Northeast Asia. Through the analyses of sediments, fauna and using radiometric dating methods, an international team of an archeologist, a geologist, a zooarcheologist, and two geochronologists, along with other specialists will reconstruct the environmental history in and around the Paleolithic sites to better understand the environment in which humans first settled. The goal is to correlate several archeological sites and to build a solid reference sequences for a region where changes in material culture and in the environment can be observed throughout the last 50,000 years. Because it exhibits an extreme continental climate, North Mongolia is suited for studies of human response to sharp changes in climate. Building up a high-resolution and high-quality environmental and archeological sequence will create field and laboratory training opportunities for students and young professionals from Mongolia and elsewhere."

The STEM Academy will accomplish its goals through the following methods and approaches: 1) providing prospective, talented science educators with a carefully crafted year-long, clinically-rich induction and mentoring program that integrates learning experiences in community-based science learning centers with preparation in formal high-need partner schools; 2) increasing capacity of STEM teaching majors from culturally diverse communities; 3) providing a career transition for STEM majors and STEM professionals; 4) providing a well-developed curriculum that enhances students' science content knowledge, teaching pedagogies, and research experience; 5) studying effective teaching practices and behaviors through apprenticeships with master teachers in host schools; and 6) providing sustainable, integrated support during the candidates' first two years of teaching. In addition to producing 48 outstanding science teachers, the STEM Academy anticipates the following potential benefits and contributions: (1) building of knowledge regarding the importance of mentor relationships on the training and retention of talented STEM professionals from culturally diverse backgrounds in the field of science education; (2) developing greater understanding of the context in which science learning occurs in both informal and formal settings; and (3) increasing the capacity of highly qualified science educators for high-needs schools who will advance scientific literacy in their classrooms.  The results of this work have the potential to assist other like-minded teacher preparation programs across the country."

Perturbations of intracellular transport can lead to intracellular traffic jams, cell death, and various diseases, analogous to the damage to a city when the transportation system breaks down. The investigator will develop multiscale models and methods to understand how the cytoskeleton and intracellular transport are affected in diseases inside an axon, which is a long thin projection of a neuron. The research results will have profound implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is anticipated that the new mathematical models can be readily generalized to other cellular transport problems. The new mathematical theory on interacting particle systems will have wide applications in biology and social sciences.  The research plan will be tightly integrated with the educational plan that will engage graduate students on interdisciplinary research and expose K-12 students to mathematical biology and scientific computing through residential summer camps. This project will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The axonal cytoskeleton is an intracellular polymer system that is responsible for the active transport of various cargoes along an axon. Disruptions of the axonal cytoskeleton and axonal transport, including radial segregation of the cytoskeleton and abnormal accumulations of cargoes, have been observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The investigator will develop multiscale models to study the axonal cytoskeleton dynamics and axonal transport in health and disease. There are three aims. The first is to derive macroscopic models for the organization of the axonal cytoskeleton in cross-section from microscopic models, and use them to investigate the striking radial segregation of the axonal cytoskeleton in disease. The second is to develop new multiscale modes for cargo transport along an axon that incorporate cargo-cargo interactions, and use them to investigate potential mechanisms that cause focal accumulations of cargoes, which are early hallmarks of nerve degeneration. The third is to develop fully three-dimensional stochastic models for the axonal cytoskeleton dynamics and axonal transport for investigation of biological questions that concern dynamics near the nodes of Ranvier, which are naturally occurring narrowing points in large axons. The multiscale modeling strategy and the close collaboration with experimentalists will lead to significant insights into the biological problem and help guide new experiments."

Cyber security professionals depend on automated tools to perform their jobs but must make critical decisions that impact security. Therefore, successful defense against cyber attacks depends on human decision making. This research identifies cognitive outcomes that predict successful threat response. The researchers are investigating the content and structure of cyber security professionals' knowledge, creating assessments of cyber security professional cognition, and developing training techniques for cyber security decision making. This project's broader impacts address the large need for cyber security workforce development. The training developed through this research will make cyber security careers more accessible to individuals beyond traditional computer science career paths. Threat response training for network defense provides a strategic advantage against cyber adversaries and increasingly sophisticated threats.<br/><br/>Effective human decision making is a determinant of effective cyber security. Situation awareness and mental models are cognitive outcomes that predict human performance. Situation awareness, defined as goal-relevant knowledge held during task performance, predicts good decision making. Security professionals also utilize internal representations of the task environment, such as how computers are interconnected, in the form of mental models. Because multiple mental models support situation awareness and vary as a function of task and expertise, understanding decision making in computer network defense requires identifying critical mental models. This research is identifying cognitive outcomes, including mental models and situation awareness, that predict successful threat response in computer network defense and leveraging them to improve training for cyber security professionals. Informed by knowledge of mental models, the research will lead to new training techniques that transfer broadly to cyber security decision making.

Their shortcomings include limited choice of work materials, chemical hazards, and thermally induced defects on machined surfaces. This award supports a study of material removal in brittle materials by the impact of nano diamond particles. Research results can lead to a low cost alternative for nanomachining at room temperature without the shortcomings of existing nanomachining processes. The new process can improve the nanomachinability of a wide variety of both conductive and nonconductive materials, and may have applications in biomedical, electronic, automotive, energy, and metal working industries. Potential applications in these industries include nanostructured scaffolds for artificial tissue engineering, nanostructured switches and wireless transmitters, ultra-low friction layers for thermal barrier coatings, and nanostructured proton exchange membranes for fuel cells. <br/> <br/>The experimental platform for the new process is an atomic force microscope where workpiece is vibrated at the frequency of 20-160 kHz. Machining is achieved by the impact of loose nano diamond particles in liquid medium. The research objective is to understand effects of kinetic energy on material removal mechanism (plastic deformation or brittle fracture). The level of kinetic energy is determined by machining conditions (primarily diamond particle size and vibration frequency). The research plan consists of computer simulations and experimental studies. Extended finite element methods will be used to simulate the machining process. In these models, to mimic the impact given by the diamond particle on the workpiece at different kinetic energy levels, the workpiece is fixed and the diamond particle is treated as a vibrating rigid body (at the frequency of 20-160 kHz). Drucker-Prager constitutive law will be employed to describe the behavior of brittle materials. Finite element models will be validated by comparing model predictions with experimental results. Machining experiments using graphene, silicon, and glass samples will be performed at different levels of kinetic energy by varying the mean size of diamond particles (5, 10, 15 nm) and vibrating the workpiece at different frequencies in the range of 20-160 kHz. Machined surfaces will be examined using electron microscopy, and optical microscope to determine if the material removal is done by plastic deformation or brittle fracture."

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels and is critical to tumor growth and development. There are many interactions between the angiogenic factors, which tumor cells must interpret and respond to. The PI proposes to apply mathematical modeling to address fundamental questions regarding the dynamics of angiogenesis signaling in tumor cells and the effects of crosstalk and cell heterogeneity. Ultimately, a detailed understanding of the signaling events involved in angiogenesis pathways can lead to effective strategies for altering angiogenesis in a range of normal and diseased conditions, including cancer. The research objectives are tightly integrated with a multi-year outreach and educational training plan to impact students ranging from K-12 through graduate school. The PI will develop a hands-on, interactive curricular resource called 'DrEAMM' (Driving Enthusiasm About Mathematical Modeling) that brings to life mathematical concepts and engages students in computational thinking. <br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to provide a predictive computational model of angiogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells. A quantitative and molecular-detailed description of these signaling networks is required to understand and inhibit tumor growth. To accomplish this goal, the PI will construct the first mathematical model to specifically identify the concentration profiles of the angiogenesis signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis in tumor cells. The model will establish, for the first time, a quantitative description of the balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and the implications of their crosstalk in cancer cells. The PI will use sensitivity analyses to explore the parameter space and a robust, data-driven parameter estimation technique to fit the model to experimental measurements, including new data generated by the PI. The model will predict the average angiogenesis signaling dynamics of a population of cells, as well as the responses of individual cells. As such, the project will include both deterministic and stochastic simulations. The model will be applied to identify the mechanisms that enable precise shifting of the angiogenic balance in favor of anti-angiogenic signaling species that promote cell death. The expected outcome of completing the proposed research objectives is a molecular-detailed description of novel strategies that lead to tumor apoptosis by targeting angiogenesis signaling. More broadly, this work can lead to breakthrough strategies needed for inhibiting cell growth by targeting angiogenesis signaling pathways in a range of cell types and conditions. The PI will pursue a multi-year outreach and educational training plan closely integrated with the proposed research. The proposed activities will bring to life mathematical concepts for students ranging from K-12 through graduate school and engage the students in computational thinking.

Examples include the design of small-scale unmanned aircrafts and morphing aircraft wings, like robo-bees, minimizing turbulence in blood flow within a stenosed or stented artery, or optimizing the pressure of the blood flow and investigating the influence of pertinent biological parameters in the case of the lamina cribrosa in the eye, where these factors are believed to be related to the development of glaucoma.

The project will focus on the particular example of the coupling between biomechanics and hemodynamics in the lamina cribrosa in the eye, where performing sensitivity analysis with respect to important parameters (like blood flow and intraocular and retrolaminar pressures) will further the understanding of the cause and progression of glaucoma, and enable novel means for preventing or treating glaucoma. This research will also be applicable to other biological fluid-solid mixtures such as cartilages, bones, and engineered tissues. <br/><br/>Moving boundary fluid-elasticity interactions and  porous media flows are nonlinear dynamical systems with Banach space parameters, and most questions related to their sensitivity analysis and control are open in the field.

Well-posedness of optimal solutions, Frechet differentiability of cost functionals and state  with respect to both distributed and boundary controls, and derivation and well-posedness analysis of adjoint systems will be addressed.

During this process, a fraction of the long polymer molecules self-assemble in ordered crystalline regions connected by regions where the molecules remain disordered. The speed of the solidification process depends on the liquid phase structure of the melt and the entanglements (topology) that long polymer molecules adopt during heating. Molecules that retain memory of the ordered state in the melt act as seeds to speed up the crystallization. This project addresses how the seeded melt structure changes in polymers with short or long branches, or with polar or non-polar branches and their role on crystallization. Studies of model blends, and polyethylenes with pendant groups, either random or at a precise distance will enable building of fundamental relations between molecular structure and properties to predict the behavior of commercial complex polyethylene materials. These studies are significant also because the great expansion of shale gas extraction  has placed the US as a very highly competitive provider of derivatives such as polyethylenes. Hence, advances in the understanding of the state of the melt and the crystallization of polyethylenes are of major relevance as they could lead to improved processing technologies and to reduced costs and energy utilization. The proposed research is also aimed at providing learning and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, many of them underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The proposed research program builds on recent developments on the strong melt memory of crystallization of random ethylene copolymers, and the unique layered crystallization of precision halogen substituted polyethylenes to further address the role of chain structure in the evolution and final crystal morphology of semicrystalline polymers with various types of short and long-chain branching. Models for random copolymers will be used to address: (a) the effect of branch length (ethyl to hexyl), chain architecture (stars, H-type, comb, pom-pom), and branch polarity (acetoxy) on melt diffusion, and self-nucleation; (b) the effect of comonomer content distribution on co-crystallization in model blends, and the interplay between sequence segregation and LLPS; (c) the generality of the role of sequence selection in crystalline melt memory. A second thrust aims to advance understanding of the evolution of the crystalline state of polyethylenes with pendant groups placed at the same equidistant length along the backbone. Taking advantage of model systems with pendant groups with controlled tacticity, the origin and drive for the formation of lamellar crystallites from isotactic as well as from atactic systems will be sought. Differences in sublamellar structure, and crystallization kinetics are of special interest as they relate to novel crystallites formed from ethylene-like copolymers with controlled tacticity that are not accessible in classical random ethylene copolymers.

For example, different temperatures, diets, pathogens and altitudes have led to local adaptations. Adaptations occur through the selection and increase of beneficial mutations in genes in a population, which can arise spontaneously by random mutation or can be acquired through admixture with another population. Analysis of human genomes has shown that some of our beneficial mutations have come from archaic human populations like the Neanderthals and Denisovans, facilitated by interbreeding between modern humans and those groups tens of thousands of years ago. This process is referred to as adaptive introgression. While there are a few examples of beneficial mutations in genes arising from adaptive introgression, in this project tools will be built to scan human genomes to identify more candidate genes for adaptive introgression and to fully characterize the importance of this process in many human populations. Importantly, the project will involve training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational science and genomics, and the tools created will be freely accessible for others to use. In addition, a new interdisciplinary course that bridges data analysis of human genetic variation, programming, statistics and biology will be offered to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>Detecting and characterizing adaptation has mostly been approached through two models: selection on de novo mutations (SDN) or selection on standing variation (SSV). Therefore it is assumed that a population either has to wait for a beneficial mutation to arise de novo or it harbors enough neutral standing variation that can become beneficial under a change in environment. However, most populations do not live in isolation and have exchanged genetic variants with other populations through admixture (gene-flow from a donor population to a recipient population). This process is an evolutionary force that may accelerate adaptation in the recipient population. The PI will model positive selection and gene-flow jointly to investigate the patterns of genetic variation under this model, to compare and contrast to the two other models of positive selection (SDN, SSV), to determine what summaries of the data accurately distinguishes adaptive gene flow from SDN and SSV, to develop novel statistics that accurately detect this type of selection and to develop statistical and computational tools to scan genomes to identify candidate regions. These tools will be applied to real data sets in humans and in other organisms. The broader impacts include training a postdoc, students, building a project-oriented course that integrates multiple disciplines (programming, statistics and modeling) that will teach students to visualize biological data sets for exploratory analyses, to test hypothesis and to fit models to the data, and bringing science to high school students through a series of lectures. Finally, all computational tools developed under this grant will be made freely available to the scientific community."

Contemporary drought, and projected future climate change, simultaneously exacerbate fire risks in the Sierra Nevada and threaten the sustainability of the water supply. Management approaches that could simultaneously reduce fire risks while safeguarding water supplies are sorely needed.  This research takes advantage of a unique pair of watersheds in the Sierra Nevada where fire suppression was practiced for almost a century prior to the 1970s, and managed wildfire has been practiced since then. These basins will be studied to determine how vegetation cover, snow and soil moisture behavior, and water yields have responded to the changed fire regime.  The results will be synthesized in a modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the potential consequences of similar shifts in fire regime elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada.  Results of the research will provide an evidence basis to motivate new fire management in the Sierra Nevada, reducing fire risk and enhancing water security in a region that supplies 60% of California's 38 million residents.  These results will be shared through an outreach program developed with the California Fire Science Consortium.  The project will also include a citizen-science project involving middle-school students participating in outdoor environmental education programs run by NatureBridge at Yosemite National Park.  <br/><br/>The removal of fire from forested mountain ecosystems represents a century-long, massive, and poorly-understood experiment, altering the composition, demography, allometry and succession dynamics of forests, with presumed (although largely unquantified) effects on biogeochemistry, hydrology and ecosystem function.  This research project leverages a unique opportunity to explore these effects by examining changes in vegetation, fire and hydrology in the only two watersheds in the Sierra Nevada where fire suppression has been deliberately alleviated and the natural fire regime allowed to re-establish.  Historical and contemporary aerial photography will be used to reconstruct vegetation histories in the study watersheds.  The resulting vegetation maps will be used as a basis for upscaling distributed soil moisture and fuel moisture measurements made throughout the study basins, and as input into distributed hydrological models.  Weather stations, snow cameras and soil moisture observations will be installed in sites with distinct post-fire vegetation successions to characterize the effects of vegetation change on local meteorological and hydrological conditions.  Laboratory experiments will be undertaken to evaluate the persistence of soil hydrophobicity under repeated freeze-thaw cycles, characteristic of the Sierra Nevada wet season.  The process insights obtained through these field observations will be used to develop, parameterize and test a probabilistic model representing the dynamic interactions of fire, vegetation and water.  The project will contribute new process understanding about the interaction of fire and hydrology in snow dominated landscapes, specifically how fire history impacts snowpack dynamics (such as interception, sublimation and melt timing), and how freeze-thaw processes impact post-fire soil hydrophobicity. It will generate unique spatial, temporal and historical datasets that will reveal the joint consequences of fire suppression and its alleviation on vegetation and hydrology in montane forests."

With few new drugs in development and rates of resistance increasing, we urgently need new, nontraditional approaches to fight pathogenic bacteria. The goal of this project is to target the delivery of molecules that facilitate the virulence of pathogenic bacteria as a novel approach to the treatment of bacterial infections. Rather than targeting some essential life process to kill the bacteria directly as traditional antibiotics due, the PI intends to target those processes that allow the pathogen to settle in the host. This CAREER proposal addresses two goals outlined by the United States CDC: to develop new approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections and to improve antibiotic stewardship. In addition to identifying unique targets for the development of novel antibiotics, the PI plans extensive outreach activities to demonstrate in a fun, hands-on manner, the danger of misusing antibiotics. The PI intends to further integrate the research with her educational goals by developing new courses at Lehigh University, providing undergraduate and graduate research opportunities, and developing a program for local Girl Scout troops to learn about STEM fields. The PI?s overall goals in these educational activities is to develop well-trained, interdisciplinary scientists and to encourage young women to<br/>choose STEM majors and pursue related technical careers.<br/><br/>Pathogenic bacteria produce certain molecules, called virulence factors that allow them to thrive within the host. One mechanism used by Gram negative bacteria to transfer these factors to target cells is the production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which bleb off from the outer membrane of the bacterium and encapsulate multiple virulence factors. The goal of this project is to characterize the<br/>trafficking of these OMVs for the identification of shared mechanisms that can be blocked to inhibit virulence factor delivery. The overall hypothesis of the project is that toxins present on the surface of the OMV facilitate binding of the OMV to the target cells, and inhibition of this binding can be used to disrupt delivery of virulence factors. To investigate this hypothesis, the PI will study three representative organisms, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Bordetella pertussis. With these three organisms, she will first characterize the mechanisms by which bacterial toxins bind to the lipid components of the OMV and determine role of membrane properties in this interaction. This aim will be accomplished by studying the affinity of each toxin for specific lipids, using isothermal titration calorimetry. Next, she will study the interaction between OMVs and specific components of host cells, using calorimetric and microscopy techniques. Finally, with this information, she will design methods to prevent OMV delivery by blocking specific factors found to facilitate OMV delivery; this will allow the PI to inhibit the virulence of these organisms. Targeting virulence in this way represents a novel approach to treating bacterial infections, which is desperately needed due to our current lack of effective antibiotic strategies."

The resulting ferritins will go through a unique hybridization approach with native ferritins to achieve derivatives presenting discrete numbers of coupling ligands. Using the hybrid ferritins as building blocks (referred to as FBBs), one can construct different supramolecular structures in a manner similar to dendrimer growth.

However, these batteries suffer from safety issues originating from the flammable liquid electrolyte that is used to transport lithium ions within the battery. One of the most promising candidates for a safer, replacement electrolyte is the ceramic lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO), which has good thermal/chemical stability and ionic transport properties. Nonetheless, there is still much fundamental research needed in order to improve understanding of several critical issues in LLZO and how to improve its performance. This project investigates novel LLZO nanowire structures and composites with unique nanoscale properties that can improve their conductivity for lithium ions and integration into safer, all-solid-state batteries. This project also supports education and outreach activities that focus on improving the pipeline and retention of female students in science and engineering through hands-on experiences that will increase understanding and retention of engineering concepts and stimulate the students' interests in research. Outreach to local middle school girls through a battery-related challenge to provide context on issues related to electric cars and research opportunities to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are example activities. Educational efforts include international exchange of teaching methodologies with faculty in South Korea to understand strategies that promote female student achievement, as well as how to best engage students from diverse backgrounds in student-centered learning environments.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research project aims to correlate composition, grain boundary structure, and crystal phase with ionic conductivity in LLZO nanowire materials prepared using electrospinning. Nanowire solid electrolytes can offer characteristics that are beneficial and advantageous compared to bulk materials - namely milder calcination conditions for crystallization, stabilization of metastable phases, and opportunities for unique structures such as core-shell composites. These characteristics can lead to properties that improve the ionic conductivity, sintering ability, and integration of the electrolytes into all-solid-state batteries. The nanowires are used to understand the LLZO phase stability, crystallization, and sintering processes. Core-shell nanowire structures are used to investigate interfacial properties and transport in composites to understand how to maximize highly conducting pathways for lithium ions and uniformly modify grain boundaries. Additionally, detailed in situ and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy is used to understand processes such as crystallization of electrospun nanowires, impurity segregation to grain boundaries, sintering in networks of nanowires, and interdiffusion at the electrolyte/cathode interface. This information is being correlated with ionic conductivity and electrochemical cycling tests on the nanowire solid electrolyte materials and compared to bulk materials. The insights gained from this work are enabling better control of composition, stabilization of metastable phases, sintering processes, and Li ion transport, which can ultimately lead to higher ionic conductivity ceramic electrolytes."

Providing adequate sanitation, safe drinking water, and food are among society's grand challenges. The development of low-energy, materials-based technologies that facilitate water treatment and reuse is central to overcoming those challenges. Improvements in water purification technologies, for which materials science and chemistry will play a vital role, are needed to provide clean water around the world. This SusChEM research project is centered on the design, discovery, and development of new polymeric materials for advanced separation applications. Specifically, the project aims include the synthesis, morphology, and structure-property fundamental understanding of new, nanostructured polymeric materials for high-efficiency water purification. The principal technologies that will be impacted by this fundamental polymer-materials research are water ultrafiltration and desalination; however other membrane-based technologies will benefit from the insights gained.  Partnerships with industry will be actively pursued, and broad training of a diverse cohort of graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral researchers will also be an important product of the efforts. Moreover, the continued development of an outreach program aimed at enthusing school age kids about science and engineering will be emphasized.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Strides in the synthesis, self-assembly, and implementation of block polymer-based materials in membrane applications have been accomplished. In this research project, significant and innovative new synthetic approaches to block polymer materials for membranes will be pursued, the complete and detailed characterization of the resultant materials will be undertaken using a bevy of modern techniques, and the implementation and testing of new membranes derived from these materials will be accomplished. The target materials for two separate but interrelated projects have tremendous potential to impact a broad swath of technologies. One of the main efforts will be on tailored approaches to functional block polymers via polymerization-induced phase separation as precursors to robust nanostructured  materials for ultrafiltration, water remediation, and metal sequestration. The other main effort is focused on the design, synthesis, development, and application of new high-performance charge mosaic membranes for piezodialysis from block polymer precursors containing independent anionic and cationic nanodomains separated by a mechanically robust block. Both of these efforts will result in fundamental and basic knowledge associated with block polymer synthesis and self-assembly and build a foundation for the development of polymers for advanced water purification technologies."

The development of sustainable, alternative resources for polymers is an open societal challenge. Epoxy resins are an important commercial class of polymer used in a variety of applications such as structural applications, advanced adhesives, aerospace and automotive components, and wind turbine blades. Epoxy resins are derived predominantly from petrochemicals. Additionally, these polymers cannot be recycled after the useful lifetime of the material. Plastic waste which is not recycled resides in landfills, and sometimes in unintentional locations such as waterways. This project will develop new epoxy resins with a reduced environmental impact through implementation of sustainable sources and enhancing the biodegradability of the materials. Two plant-based resources will be examined: vegetable oils and phenolic acids (found in many fruit and vegetable byproducts). Chemical routes will be developed for preparation of these materials, and their physical performance will be investigated. This project will also cultivate knowledge in students, educators and the general public on the impact of polymers on the environment, through the following activities: expansion of the Materials Day at UH program for local K-12 students, development of modules for the Houston Energy Day and Houston Earth Day celebrations, and participation of graduate and undergraduate students in research activities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop new epoxy resins which contain sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic components, yet maintain the advantageous properties of conventional, petroleum-sourced materials. The research plan is structured around three specific aims. In the first aim, synthetic strategies will be established for epoxy resins containing biobased components. Plant-sourced phenolic acids will be employed to impart desirable mechanical behavior to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of aromatic rings) and soybean oil will be employed to impart biodegradability to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of ester linkages). In the second aim, a detailed understanding of structure-property-function relationships in sustainable epoxy resins will be developed. The functionality of the starting components is expected to have a great impact on the structural parameters of the epoxy network and ultimate macroscopic mechanical properties. The design of multicomponent epoxy resins will be leveraged to develop microphase separated thermoset blends with advantageous properties. In the third aim, hydrolytic degradation and biodegradation of epoxy resins containing soybean oil will be investigated. A key premise of the proposed work is that epoxy resins derived from soybean oil will maintain their properties during the useful lifetime of the products they are utilized in, yet can undergo biodegradation in a compost environment. The expected outcomes from this study are synthetic pathways to epoxy resins from non-traditional sources, characterization of the thermal and mechanical behavior of the newly derived epoxy resins, morphological investigation of microphase separated multicomponent epoxy resins, and hydrolytic and biodegradation mechanisms of epoxy resins which contain ester linkages."

Manifolds are a generalized notion of space, appearing throughout mathematics and science more broadly. For example, the solutions to a set of equations will often have the structure of a smooth manifold. It is important for both mathematics and its applications to further our understanding of manifolds and their symmetries. Participants in the conference will include leading experts on the study of manifolds, and the purpose of the conference is to further our understanding of this central concept. <br/><br/>The conference features plenary lectures by twelve leading world experts. The breadth of the expertise represented by the speakers reflects the breadth of the topic of the conference, the topology of manifolds. Within the topology of manifolds, the conference will focus on three specific areas, the study of moduli spaces, calculus of functors, and algebraic K- and L-theory, all of which have contributed to spectacular classical and recent advances in our understanding of manifolds of low and high dimension. The plenary and contributed talks will cover the forefront of research into the theory of manifolds. The conference will provide younger researchers with opportunities for exchange of knowledge, for networking, and for building collaborations with international peers and future colleagues.

The architecture of a polymer molecule directly affects the properties of the materials they are used to prepare. Polymers are designed to have a characteristic and static molecular structure selected for a specific application. This project involves the development and investigation of polymers composed of reversible bonds that enable dramatic transformations in their architecture when triggered. This concept introduces a new paradigm in the field of responsive polymeric materials. The resulting polymers will be structurally robust while also allowing themselves to be healed when damaged. Applications of stimuli-responsive materials are continually being developed, with significant promise having been demonstrated in the area of drug delivery, smart coatings, and self-healing materials. Polymers that undergo architectural transformations in solution may have potential utility as additives in motor oil or personal care products. Materials that demonstrate self-healing and recyclability before being fixed at elevated temperatures could address one of the fundamental limitations of many materials constructed via reversible linkages, namely their propensity to slowly deform over time. The project also includes outreach and education activities directed toward local K-12 students and training of graduate and undergraduate students in emerging areas of chemistry and polymer science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Currently, most examples of stimuli-responsive polymers derive their response from changes in molecular size through alterations of chain conformation or changes in polymer-solvent or polymer-polymer interactions. However, the fundamental characteristic of molecular architecture has not typically been considered a variable because a macromolecule's topology is ""locked"" by its covalent primary structure. This project challenges this convention by investigating materials that transform their covalent architecture when triggered by an external stimulus. <br/><br/>By preparing polymers capable of exchanging irreversible bonds for reversible bonds, a new class of responsive materials that adapt to their surroundings by transitions in their covalent architecture can be achieved. Specifically, three systems are being considered: (1) macromolecules capable of topological transformations in solution; (2) adaptable organogels that modify their covalent structure; and (3) transformable bulk materials with ""switchable"" crosslinks. The first system involves polymers with complex chain architectures that irreversibly transform into new architectures when triggered. The second and third systems involve reversibly-crosslinked polymer networks that are structurally-dynamic, meaning they can be triggered to significantly rearrange their internal structure to become irreversibly crosslinked (i.e., ""fixed""). These three areas have been chosen to investigate the potential of this approach across a wide spectrum of sizes (nano to macro) and material states (solution, gels, and bulk) and to dramatically expand the definition of stimuli-responsive materials."

The need for fine-grained access control to sensitive data has never been greater, and new paradigms like functional encryption have the potential to deliver cryptographic systems that can be tailored to a variety of data uses and privacy needs. However, as systems have grown more complex, they have naturally grown more difficult to reason about. By building new frameworks for security reductions and enhancing the mathematical foundations available to instantiate these frameworks, this project makes fast progress towards a flexible and more unified theory of cryptography that can meet these mounting challenges. In particular, the project integrates recent results in lattice cryptography with new advances in designing security reductions in order to provide strong arguments for the security of highly flexible and customizable cryptographic systems. <br/><br/>The project results are incorporated into the curriculum of advanced graduate classes to provide a more integrated view of cryptographic system design principles.

The PI has two goals through this project: <br/>(1) To develop a computationally efficient correction to the ground-state correlation energy of the random phase approximation. Without a correction, the random phase approximation would not be accurate enough to become a benchmark in chemistry and materials science. Some of the currently existing corrections are accurate, but the price is a high computational cost.<br/>(2) To make the computationally efficient time-dependent density functional theory competitive in accuracy with more complex quantum many-body techniques. Time-dependent density functional theory is an extension of density functional theory to time-dependent potentials. Time-dependent density functional theory has become a very popular tool to compute excitation energies.  It is computationally efficient, but its accuracy is moderate compared to quantum many-body Green's function-based methods. The most commonly used adiabatic local density kernel misses excitonic effects. <br/><br/>The PI will further develop a nonlocal energy-optimized kernel model that is computationally efficient and can capture these effects. Both for ground and excited states the same nonlocal exchange-correlation kernel is to be added to the Coulomb electron-electron interaction kernel in the frequency-dependent linear response function of the ground state. The nonlocal energy-optimized kernel will be applied to molecules and materials. The kernel correction will be tested and applied to many ground-state properties, such as atomization energies, cohesive energies, structural phase transitions, clusters and adsorption problems. The kernel correction to time-dependent density functional theory will be applied to excitation energies including those in semiconductors with a particular focus on photovoltaic materials for solar cell applications.<br/><br/>This award supports an educational activity focused on graduate, undergraduate and high-school students.

Currently, one of the biggest challenges is analyzing the data in ways that reliably extract signals from noise.  Specifically, genome sequences from individuals in a population contain information that can be used to unravel the biological history of the population and to discover which genes are adaptive, deleterious, or just along for the ride.  However, extracting this information and using it to draw such conclusions is a far from trivial undertaking due to the massive scale of modern datasets and due to the many complex and interrelated factors that affect how populations change over time.  The proposed research will develop new computational methods for inference from population genomic data.  The development of these new methods aims to improve scientists' abilities to use population genomic data to answer a variety of questions, such as: What are the genetic changes associated with adaptation? How repeatable and predictable are the genetic changes associated with the diversification of an ancestral species into a variety of modern species (i.e., an ""adaptive radiation"")?  The new methods will be applied to two independent examples of adaptive radiations involving butterflies commonly found in North and Central America because a wealth of excellent data and technical resources already exist for these species.  Beyond making inferences about these particular groups of species, the proposed research will have broader impacts in two main ways.  First, the novel computational methods and software developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to genetic analysis in a variety of basic and applied scientific disciplines.  This open-source software will be freely disseminated.  Second, the results will form the basis for constructing educational museum exhibits on genomics and the tree of life.<br/><br/>Natural selection and speciation are the fundamental evolutionary processes responsible for life's fantastic diversity, yet the genes and specific genetic changes responsible for adaptive traits and the genetic mechanisms that cause speciation are largely unknown. Emerging molecular and analytical methods offer great promise to address these issues, but studies of speciation are generally limited by at least two factors. First, studies of a single example of divergence (e.g., in one hybrid zone) suffer from the ""n=1"" problem: without replication of divergence, the generalities from a single species pair are unclear.  Second, a priori quantitative predictions from multiple, contrasting hypotheses are rarely developed; indeed, there is often little consensus about the patterns expected under a given verbal hypothesis about evolutionary processes. The proposed research will address both issues by using existing empirical data and development of novel theoretical methods to investigate how the species boundary evolves over space and time using multiple species pairs in two independent examples of adaptive diversification among hybridizing lineages of mimetic butterflies: Heliconius and Limenitis. Specifically, researchers will: 1) collaborate to statistically characterize the empirical systems and 2) develop population genomic theory and test quantitative predictions about the accumulation of genomic divergence across the species boundary continuum. The results of this project will provide a uniquely comprehensive portrait of the evolving species boundary in a comparative framework, and will thereby provide a powerful examination of questions about the generalities of evolutionary processes and genomic patterns that characterize speciation at multiple points along the continuum of divergence. These questions include: How porous is the species boundary among hybridizing species? How does divergent selection shape genomic variation among hybridizing lineages?

In addition to answering these questions, the work will yield broadly applicable computational methods for quantitatively testing hypotheses about the genomic signatures of multiple evolutionary processes acting alone or in concert."

Conductive materials are critical for advanced tissue regeneration, smart drug release and bioelectronics with high impacts on research and industry. Current conductive materials contain multiple components, which result in complexity, instability and uncontrollability of the material properties which limits their applications in biomedicine. The proposed unicomponent materials can address above challenges to bridge the gap between conductive materials and biomedicine. The proposed mechanism and methodologies can be utilized to design new conductive materials for broader applications, not just limited to biomedicine. Furthermore, the education and outreach for k-12, undergraduate and graduate students is integrated with the multidisciplinary cutting-edge material research. The challenge/interactive-driven teaching will be designed for undergraduate/graduate students with emphasis on the participation of Hispanic students and enhanced curriculum. Elementary and high school students will be encouraged to join the Interaction-Enhanced Biomaterial Program along with their families and teachers. A workshop on conductive materials and biomedicine will be further organized for high school, undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Technical section:<br/>Biodegradable conductive materials are gaining increased interest for tissue regeneration, drug release and bioelectronics. The existing conductive biodegradable materials are multicomponent and contain non-degradable conductive additives or dopants. These complex components lead to low conductive stability or dramatically affect mechanical properties with risks of toxicity and complications in vivo, which limit their biomedical applications. Furthermore, it is hard to tune the complex multicomponent systems for specific material properties, and to precisely understand fundamental structure-conductivity relationships. To this end, this CAREER project will develop unicomponent, biodegradable, elastic and conductive materials without extra dopants/additives. The research objectives include 1) understand structure-property-function of the new polymer system, 2) develop new multifunctional conductive polymers, and 3) evaluate material biocompatibility and conductivity-cellular function relationship. Furthermore, k-12, undergraduate and graduate students will be educated and trained in this cutting-edge research project in the innovative biomaterial development and applications through various approaches with emphasis on Hispanic student participation and family/teacher involvement."

The goal of this program is to recruit mathematics majors that will become 30 highly qualified mathematics teachers in Arizona.  The program will offer a head-on response to the shortage of highly qualified mathematics teachers through multifaceted and innovative recruitment activities, and by implementing a teacher preparation program that develops and strengthens prospective teachers' abilities to work with diverse students across Arizona and the rest of the nation. The program is characterized by involving a community of mathematics and mathematics education faculty, undergraduates, teachers, secondary mathematics students and their families in a collective effort to prepare high-quality mathematics teachers. While the program is designed for University of Arizona students to work with students from local school districts, it has the potential to become a model for other programs across the country; especially in the way prospective teachers interact with the local community and learn to incorporate their culture and language as educational assets. <br/><br/>AZ MaTh will prepare secondary mathematics teachers with strong content and pedagogical knowledge as well as a deep understanding of cultural and linguistic aspects in the teaching and learning of mathematics to diverse students. The overall goals of the AZ Noyce MaTh Program will be to: (1) promote secondary mathematics teaching as a viable and engaging career choice for talented undergraduate students in mathematics, (2) recruit undergraduate students into the STEM teacher pipeline, with an emphasis on academic merit, and to increase the number of Secondary Mathematics Education Program graduates in the Department of Mathematics, (3) create a sustainable recruitment program for future mathematics teachers that includes significant and substantial experiences to work with middle and high school students, and (4) enhance our Secondary Mathematics Education Program to prepare future mathematics teachers for excellence in teaching and working with ethnically and linguistically diverse students in Arizona and nationwide. The AZ MaTh program provides high quality experiences for the potential teachers to work with students and families in local area schools, and with other undergraduate students enrolled in mathematics courses at various levels. These experiences include serving as (1) tutors in local secondary schools, (2) undergraduate teaching assistants in mathematics courses for elementary teachers, (3) teacher assistants in summer internships with partner schools, and (4) interns in an afterschool program at a partner bilingual school. Course materials and the outcomes and experiences of the Noyce scholars in the afterschool program will be made available to other mathematics educators and teacher preparation programs. The project takes advantage of ongoing and planned collaborations between mathematicians and mathematics educators to improve undergraduate course curricula for prospective teachers. The project team's research efforts also have the potential to contribute to a broad understanding of how intentional cultural sensitivity and attentiveness to language barriers during pre-service training of math teachers can lead to student success and a diversity in the types of teachers recruited to the program."

Each axon carries information from one single nerve cell (neuron). As an embryo develops, these fibers have to connect up correctly in order to make working neural circuits. Before these connections can form, the neurons have to move from the place they are born to the location where they will perform their role. Previously, the Principal Investigators have studied this process in the facial nerve, which controls facial expressions, and found that a single ""pioneer"" neuron guides the movement of the remaining neurons to their final destinations. Where do pioneer neurons come from, how do they know where to go, and how do other neurons know how to follow them? This project will address these questions in developing zebrafish embryos (animals with facial nerves similar to humans). Zebrafish embryos are transparent, and the experiments use specially-engineered zebrafish whose facial neurons are fluorescently labeled to make their cell migration visible. Experiments will also examine the roles of particular molecules found on the cell surface that are important for cell migration (cell adhesion molecules). A new kind of 3-dimensional imaging (light sheet microscopy) will be used to measure cell movements, and new software will be developed to visualize and analyze cell movement data. Once developed and tested at the University of Chicago and the Marine Biological Laboratory, these software tools will be made freely available. The project will additionally provide training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students; introduce elementary and middle school students to research; and engage the public via interactive displays at the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI).<br/><br/>Subsets of neurons migrate tangentially within the neuroepithelial plane, often over significant distances. To better understand mechanisms underlying tangential migration that are important for neural circuit formation, this project focuses on facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), which undergo a tangential migration that is conserved in vertebrates ranging from fishes to mammals. The study will utilize zebrafish embryos as they are accessible, transparent, and a powerful genetic model. Migrating FBMNs will be imaged in transparent zebrafish embryos with genetically marked cells, and tracked using light sheet microscopy. The Principal Investigator recently described the pioneer neuron as the first FBMN to migrate on each side of the hindbrain, and demonstrated the critical role of this neuron. Aim 1 will study the newly recognized pioneer neuron by establishing its cellular origins and tracking its subsequent trajectory through development. FBMN tangential migration also relies on interactions with two different pre-laid axon tracts and both interactions depend on adhesion molecule N-Cadherin. Aim 2 will investigate the role of N-Cadherin in mediating interactions between FBMNs and axon tracts, and whether it functions autonomously within neurons during migration. Additional adhesion molecules important for FBMN migration will be identified using RNAseq. An integral part of this project will be the development of new, broadly-applicable computational tools to analyze imaging data."

Although there have been great advances in the compression and transfer of audio and video signals for telecommunication, there is still a significant challenge in providing the appropriate tools for conveying expert knowledge in distributed work settings.  Surgical telemedicine is one domain where collaborative interaction with highly specialized images is vital for the efficient and effective conveyance of expert information, and the collaborating individuals may not have the same level of expertise.  In this research the PI will systematically ascertain the challenges of expert distributed communication of technical images and the benefits that collaborative image interaction has in conveying expert knowledge in distributed work.  Because the findings from this research will be translatable to other expert distributed environments that utilize imagery in order to have a positive effect on distributed collaborative work practices, project outcomes will have broad implications aside from the immediate benefit of providing manipulation and annotation ability on images for distributed collaborative work to support healthcare.  The project will provide educational experiences at multiple levels by including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in this interdisciplinary research.  Because the PI will actively engage and mentor under-represented groups throughout the project, the work may also increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in science and technology.  Finally, the PI will disseminate results broadly in both the medical and HCI literature, and coordinate workshops at the respective yearly conferences, in order to engage a wider audience of researchers and system designers.<br/><br/>This work is part of a long term effort by the PI in investigating how images play a part in scientific and medical collaborative practices, particularly with regards to how both professionals and lay people perceive the information through images and, in turn, the effects of new mechanisms for sensing, presenting, and interacting with those images.  The research aims are: to determine the verbal and non-verbal mechanisms for conveying expert knowledge in co-located and distributed collaboration with images; to develop a prototype for distributed collaborative image interaction; to determine the effects of collaborative image interaction on expert communication processes and performance outcomes; and to determine the effects of and the reactions to collaborative image interaction on distributed work practices.  The educational objective is to produce scholars with a deep understanding of collaborative technology design and social science evaluation on health information system success.  This is part of a long-term effort by the PI to engage under-represented groups in computer and information science by exposing them to the process of developing technology solutions to real world problems.  Specific educational activities will include development of an internship program for high school students to participate in research and systems design on the real-world problems of the operating room, and development of a cross-listed graduate course on telemedicine that utilizes a project-based curriculum to bring together the expertise of graduate students from three different UMBC graduate programs: Information Systems, Human Centered Computing, and Health IT."

Probabilistic models are commonly used to represent physical, biological and financial phenomena that are often however too complex to solve, approximate or even simulate. The primary purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate problems related to multiscale systems, rare events and related Monte Carlo simulation methods. We are interested in studying stochastic dynamical systems that may have different time scales and understudying and quantifying related events that may be rare in a given time scale, but can have important consequences for the system itself. Exact solutions are typically impossible, so one has to rely on simulation and for this reason rigorous development of provably-efficient approximation methods and simulation Monte Carlo methods is in the core of our analysis. The problems of interest in this project are motivated both by fundamental mathematical questions and by a broad array of questions in other branches of science. Examples range from estimation of rare event probabilities in chemical physics, genetic switch models in biology, tracking loop problems in engineering to network failure and large portfolio losses in complex financial systems, where multiscale features and rare events are core issues. In addition, the research project is integrated with an educational program that is designed to help in the training of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering and chemistry in the exploration of rare events, multiscale processes and their analysis, calibration and simulation.<br/><br/>This research project leads to the development of a rigorous mathematical framework that allows to design provably efficient algorithms associated to modeling and estimation of rare events as well as statistical calibration methods. We are interested in both the large deviations regime (tail or rare events) as well as in the moderate deviations regime (the gap between the typical center and the tail of the distribution). We develop provably-efficient Monte Carlo methods such as importance sampling and statistical calibration methods. In a closely related direction we rigorously investigate the consequences of violation of time-reversibility in the design of Monte Carlo methods such as steady state simulation and algorithms for acceleration of convergence to equilibrium. The research project attempts to crystallize concepts and methods that are not well understood such as the effect of metastability on Monte Carlo methods and of multiple scales on large and moderate deviations, on Monte Carlo methods and on statistical estimation methods. The goal is to provide a useful and reliable methodology for simulation and statistical procedures for complex stochastic multiscale dynamical systems that can be used by a wide collection of disciplines and also open frontiers for research. Metastability behavior and multiscale phenomena are of central interest."

Territory management in organizations is a natural behavior stemming from evolutionary pressures to reinforce or expand one's own group's territory within an environment, but can have both beneficial and harmful outcomes in modern day organizations. While beneficial outcomes of territory management in organizations can include decision efficacy, team cohesion, and clear expectations about work, harmful outcomes include lost market share, missed opportunities, gridlock, and a cycle of relational deterioration among groups. Little is currently understood about what territory management looks like in organizations, what the conditions are that lead to harmful versus beneficial consequences, and how territory management might be reinforced in organizations.  The proposed research uses a mixed method approach to study this phenomenon in organizations. Two studies will be conducted. The first involves a qualitative study into the behaviors and forms through which territory management manifests in organizations, and possible conditions that lead to harmful versus beneficial effects. The second study will involve a dynamic computation modeling study to test factors that may reinforce cycles of territory management in organizations. Findings will be used to help managers identify if a cycle of territory management among their groups is occurring and possible leverage points they may have to break the loop of territory management among their groups if necessary. Further, the proposed research will help future researchers more advantageously target their resources in conducting research on cross-group conflict over organizational territories. <br/><br/>Territory management in organizations is a natural behavior stemming from evolutionary pressures to reinforce or expand one's own group's territory within an environment, but can have both beneficial and harmful outcomes in modern day organizations. The current project seeks to better understand this phenomenon in organizations using a mixed method approach by (1) collecting empirical data to articulate the behaviors and forms in which territory management between groups manifest, and to begin linking these behaviors and forms to antecedents and consequences; (2) formally modeling key theoretical features relevant to territory management among groups in organizations through a computational model informed by literature and data from the empirical study; and (3) begin testing propositions and emergent predictions within the extended theoretical space that only computational modeling allows (e.g., enabling the exploration of emergent outcomes arising from individual groups interacting and reacting to one another and their environment over time). This project will help develop and refine a conceptual model of territory management and offer a new lens through which to understand cross-group interactions.  A territory management lens has the potential to synthesize aspects of intergroup conflict, such as group identity, finite resources, uncertainty and change, legitimacy, and control and autonomy, into a more parsimonious model.  The proposed computational modeling approach will help to test which variables are fundamental in a system view of territory management, while the proposed empirical study may help begin to untangle what types of territory management behaviors may be beneficial or harmful to groups (and their organizations)."

Stochastic programs are challenging to solve, especially when uncertainty characterization relies on a large number of scenarios. Consequently, both scenario decomposition and scenario reduction (clustering and aggregation) techniques are used to reduce computational burden. The latter are performed either in a heuristic manner, or in a way that does not utilize information from intermediate solutions. This project's objective is to advance a computational framework based on partitioning the scenario set adaptively during the solution process. If successful, the technique can be potentially integrated into existing algorithms and software. By enabling faster computation, and in some cases making it possible to solve larger problem instances, the project has the potential to impact a whole host of applications requiring optimization under uncertainty. <br/><br/>The adaptive partition-based framework will provide a mechanism to aggregate information from scenario sub-problems, by replacing the entire scenario set with an adaptively constructed partition of scenarios. If successful, this will lead to an algorithmic way to coordinate the efforts between approximating the distribution and optimization. The approach will integrate both the optimal (static) scenario reduction technique and the regularized cutting-plane method with inexact oracles in the context of stochastic programs. The developed algorithms will address two-stage and multi-stage stochastic linear programs as well as stochastic integer programs."

As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. The Social-Behavioral Research Training in American Indian Community-Based Projects REU will provide a 10-week hands-on research experience and training activities including weekly training seminars/journal club. Underrepresented students (women, racial and ethnic minorities, rural, first-generation college students) will be recruited utilizing recruitment methods and contacts previously established with a successful summer internship for American Indian undergraduates. The undergraduates benefiting from this program will be able to contribute to projects which are advancing knowledge of American Indian infants, children, adolescents, and communities in the social- behavioral research context. The results of these innovative studies fill a gap in the research literature, because there is little published on American Indian populations. The proposed program fits well with several aspects of the NSF mission and impacting society. For example, it increases diversity in the social science workforce, particularly among women, American Indian, rural, and first generation undergraduates. Undergraduate research training for underrepresented students has the potential to reduce educational disparities for these groups by increasing the number of underrepresented students matriculating from 4-year universities with degrees in the social-behavioral sciences, which in turn will increase the diversity in the regional and national scientific community. <br/><br/>This investment in building Rosebud Sioux Tribe and Oglala Sioux Tribe's research infrastructure is critical, and the proposed REU  expands networks and partnerships, enhancing the social capital of the trainees, mentors, and broader American Indian communities. Some of the projects the students work on involve quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the role of adolescent self-efficacy, empowerment, historical trauma, family and peer norms in decision-making in risky behaviors; Risk Models for infant death (vulnerable infant, critical developmental period, & exogenous stressor) to establish the risk profile that combines genetic, environmental, biochemical, and physiologic information; community-based participatory research, with a needs assessment of the obesity epidemic and associated factors; and other projects in the general areas related to American Indian community. The objectives are to a) increase students' research skills and knowledge of the research process and b) assist students in short- and long-term goal setting to help increase their future educational and research-related career success. The long-term intended impact is to increase the diversity of the social-behavioral science workforce with graduate degrees. This REU will benefit society through its results which will inform new areas for research, interventions, and ultimately public policy. This research has great potential for transformative outcomes for population health and wellness, through informing best practices in interventions for American Indian communities. The ultimate focus of the evaluation will determine the degree to which the REU achieves its objectives and works towards the overall mission of increasing the diversity of the social-behavioral science research workforce with graduate degrees through increasing the number of underrepresented undergraduates completing hands-on, independent research internships in the social-behavioral sciences. Our program is guided by the Circle of Courage model, which emphasizes the importance of fostering a sense of belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity among the trainees. <br/>This project is co-funded by the NSF EPSCoR program."

NSF funds will be used to defray travel and lodging expenses for participants based in the US, with priority for invited speakers, and for junior mathematicians without other sources of funding. The conference  will have an  impact in fostering communication and collaboration between topologists at various career stages, providing perspective and new research directions for young mathematicians. <br/><br/>Modern 4-manifold theory can be said to have begun in the early 1980s with the work of Donaldson applying gauge theory. Since 2000, the attention of many low-dimensional topologists has shifted to dimension 3, where  Floer-theoretic invariants  have allowed remarkable progress. However, some of the most striking applications of these invariants of 3-manifolds, and from a certain point of view the philosophical motivation for the invariants themselves, relate to 4-manifolds either directly or through the techniques involved. Moreover, there are a number of fundamental unsolved problems in 4-manifold theory that may yield to new ideas rooted in Floer theory. The conference will serve the dual function of publicizing the newest ideas and approaches to these unsolved problems, and of introducing a younger generation to 4-manifold theory. With participation by some of the preeminent leaders in the field as well as many talented younger mathematicians, the organizers hope that this conference will touch off new activity and progress in 4-manifold topology. As a part of the conference we also plan to celebrate the work of Ron Fintushel and Ron Stern which has been very influential in the development of the field.  The organizers will edit and publish a volume of proceedings associated with this conference, with contributions from many of the speakers. The centerpiece of the volume will be a section devoted to open problems in 4-manifold topology based on problem sessions run during the conference by Rob Kirby, Ron Fintushel and Ron Stern.<br/><br/>Further details can be found on the conference webpage, https://www.renyi.hu/~ldtbud/Dubrovnik/"

Cyanobacterial blooms occur in freshwater lakes and reservoirs as a result of environmental conditions, resulting in the release of small-molecule cyanotoxins into the water. These toxins pose a serious threat to human health, with exposure resulting in both acute and chronic disease. Cyanotoxin contamination is especially problematic with the accelerated eutrophication of water sources promoted by phosphorus- and nitrogen-fueled cyanobacterial growth, as was observed in the Lake Erie incidence in 2015.<br/><br/>The proposed research and outreach activities build from a firm and successful foundation established by the principal investigator (PI). The PI developed DNA split aptmer technology for cocaine and has demonstrated her group's ability to construct lateral flow sensors using this technology in a sandwich format. The PI will apply this knowledge to create DNA split aptmers for the detection of two cyanotoxins - microcystin and saxitoxin. Algal toxin levels in drinking water are actively monitored in developed nations. However, such monitoring is lacking for much of the global drinking water supply. Toxin exposure frequently results from recreational water use where widespread monitoring is impractical. Among the most prevalent and harmful of these waterborne small-molecule toxins are microcystin-LR and saxitoxin. The proposed research activities explore two novel, and potentially transformative concepts: (1) The use of DNA aptamer-functionalized membranes to selectively remove toxins from drinking water, and (2) The application of DNA split aptamer ligation to construct inexpensive, user-friendly lateral flow sensors. In addition to generating new technologies, this research will provide insight into DNA assembly and DNA-small molecule interactions, and will establish a reliable and efficient method for generating DNA split aptamers. This will lay a foundation for a long-term effort aimed at developing new methods for the detection and removal of small-molecule water contaminants. Additionally, future expansion of the proposed activities could focus on developing a user interface that would enable the general public to report positive test results for waterborne toxins. This would harness the power of crowdsourcing to share information among the public regarding contamination events, and would provide scientists and engineers with data to help them better understand the environmental conditions that give rise to toxic cyanobacterial blooms."

However, living systems - unlike mechanical devices - inevitably evolve when their DNA sequences accumulate copying errors, often resulting in ""broken"" cells that no longer function as they were programmed. This project will address this problem by better characterizing how engineered cells evolve and using this information to design DNA sequences and host cells that are reinforced against unwanted evolution.  Decreasing the incidence of evolutionary failures in bioengineering will have broad benefits: increasing the complexity of DNA-based devices that can be constructed and used for the sustainable production of biofuels and drugs; limiting the potential dangers of unpredictable evolution when genetically modified organisms are used in future applications outside of the laboratory; and inspiring a new generation of students to pursue careers in science and technology by improving the chances that their first synthetic biology projects are successful.<br/><br/>For efforts ranging in scale from constructing small genetic circuits and metabolic pathways to international research consortia rebuilding entire microbial genomes, stopping - or at least slowing - evolution would greatly improve the efficiency of biological engineering. This research will: (i) create software to predict evolutionary weaknesses (failure modes) in the DNA sequences encoding devices so that they can be avoided at the design stage, (ii) develop high-throughput experimental techniques based on next-generation DNA sequencing to more fully characterize these failure modes and improve these predictions, and (iii) use directed evolution and genome editing to create variants of organisms that are common chassis for synthetic biology with reduced mutation rates. These research activities are integrated with education by supporting an undergraduate International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team at the University of Texas at Austin and their graduate student mentors. They will standardize methods for measuring the evolutionary reliability of biological devices and improve the stability of popular genetic parts in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, a resource used worldwide in education and research.

This research will investigate a striking case in a group of trees and shrubs (Viburnum) in which rapid differentiation appears to have occurred repeatedly into two radically different plant forms. Major differences in the leaves of these plants appear to have resulted from adaptation to adjacent forest types that differ subtly in environmental variables. The evident replication of this process in several different mountain regions throughout the New World tropics, provides a rare opportunity to critically test a model of rapid ecological speciation. Detailed studies of adjacent plant populations will be carried out in different mountain regions in Mexico with the aim of identifying the environmental factors and the nature of the variation within populations that have favored the rapid evolution of these leaf traits. It should also be possible to identify genes that underlie these key plant characteristics by taking advantage of natural hybridization between these species. These studies will yield general insights into speciation but also into the adaptive significance of the leaf traits that differentiate related species throughout the flowering plants. This research will be carried out in collaboration with Mexican scientists and will involve multiple undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities have been designed to foster interactions between participants from the United States and Mexico.  <br/><br/>This project focuses specifically on understanding the drivers of speciation in three species pairs in the mountains of Eastern and Southern Mexico. The two species in each pair differ dramatically in leaf size and shape (large and round versus small and elliptical), in leaf margins (toothed versus smooth), and in leaf pubescence (densely hairy versus lacking hairs). The research will focus on quantifying variation within individual plants, within populations, and between the species pairs, and on determining the abiotic and biotic factors that differ between their forest habitats. Hypotheses on the adaptive value of the leaf variables will be tested using transects between adjacent habitats and a reciprocal transplant experiment.  In areas that have long been disturbed by indigenous agricultural practices, extensive hybridization has resulted in a wide array of intermediate leaf forms.  Molecular analyses of these hybrid swarms should allow the identification of the major genes that underlie differences in leaf form. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Permeability of these membranes would be programmed and controlled when activated by light. As part of this project, cargo-loaded vesicles that are sensitive to multiple wavelengths will be developed such that the release of multiple cargos release would be discretely controlled by using different wavelengths of light. Biomaterials that allow for robust external control of membrane permeability are, at present, constrained by poor stability and/or poor control of permeability. Lipid-enclosed compartments in living systems play a central role in serving as the general barrier between external and internal biomolecules and chemicals. A wide range of protein-based transport systems have evolved in living systems to permit the movement of molecules through membranes without destroying the overall membrane integrity. These transport systems are usually specific only for certain cargo and are not suitable as general-purpose gateways for natural or synthetic phospholipid-enclosed compartments and cargos.<br/><br/>Graduate students supported by this award will lead a cutting-edge materials research on lipid membranes with controllable permeability. Additionally, this award will assist in solidifying a robust educational and research training program in the recently established Biomedical Engineering Department, SUNY at Buffalo. This program is expected to develop into a vital part of the economic and social fabric of Western New York. In addition, this research program will provide opportunities for underrepresented minorities and undergraduate students with a first-class research training program that will allow them to hone their skills for a lifetime career in science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award is to develop a new class of vesicles with highly programmable and controllable membranes that are permeable when the vesicles are activated by Near Infrared light. Earlier studies by this researcher has indicated that porphyrin-phospholipid (PoP) entities can self-assemble into liposome-like vesicles with unusual biophotonic properties. It was also determined on how to induce transient permeability of PoP liposomes using near infrared (NIR) light. This system was later developed to a target cargo-loaded liposomes by simple aqueous incubation of histidine-tagged peptides with cobalt-PoP (Co-PoP) liposomes. With this award, this researcher will develop new biomaterials with exquisite control of when, how and where the light-induced membrane permeability occurs in liposome-like vesicles. As part of this project, multiple vesicles with varying lipid compositions will be developed with different membrane permeability properties such that the release of multiple cargos from these liposomes can be discretely controlled by using different wavelengths of light. The main aims of the proposal are: 1) to develop different porphyrin-phospholipid systems with controlled rates of light-triggered cargo release; 2) to use multi-channel NIR light to control the release of different cargos; and 3) to create ligand-targeted liposomes with light-triggered permeability. In addition to supporting an intensive research and teaching program, this CAREER award will provide training to both graduate and undergraduate students."

This research focuses on understanding the formation, growth and eventual demise of volcanoes that mark the process of subduction, where tectonic plates return to Earth's interior. Minerals recovered from deep beneath the western Pacific Ocean floor by the International Ocean Discovery Program will be examined to decipher the history of volcano growth above an evolving subduction zone. The goals of the research are to use the chemistry of these minerals, called zircons, to better understand the life cycle of volcanoes, especially the timing of explosive volcanic eruptions. This research involves strong integration of research and education by involving undergraduate university students both in the laboratory and in field-based research projects at similar ocean floor volcanic systems that are now exposed on land in the Sierra Nevada mountains in the western United States. <br/><br/>The goal of this study is to better understand the generation of silicic melts in a new and evolving intra-oceanic volcanic arc by searching for petrologic links between silicic volcanism and tonalitic arc plutonism and using this to better understand the evolution of the related magmatic processes through time. The primary goal of the research is to test whether (or to what extent) detrital zircons in drill cores, recovered by the International Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 351 and other legacy ocean drilling cores from a relatively primitive oceanic arc setting, record the regional and/or secular variation in silicic melts that crystallized magmatic zircon. Geochronology and trace element geochemistry of the zircons will allow comparisons between the thermal and melt chemical evolution recorded by arc-derived detrital zircons and by igneous zircons recovered in dredge samples of contemporaneous arc tonalite. This study will also generate an internally-consistent database of geochemical parameters for arc-derived zircons from a compositional range of marine arcs that will be useful for comparative zircon provenance studies, as these studies evolve to more commonly include key geochemical provenance indicators."

This program is relevant to food-energy-water nexus problems and solutions. Artificial water channels, a new class of channels made using organic synthesis, were recently demonstrated by the PI to have permeability properties similar to biological water channels, or aquaporins, and their current synthetic analogs, carbon nanotubes. This research approach has the potential to be a ""game changer"" in membrane treatment of water.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to design and synthesize a new class of membranes based on peptide-appended pillar[5]arene channels. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is: Solvent compatible channels will enable the scalable synthesis of practical ultra-permeable channel-based membranes. The scientific research objectives of the program are: 1) Understand the effect of angstrom-scale pore properties of diameter, hydrophobicity, and charge, on selectivity and water permeability using model peptide-appended pillar[5]arene channels; 2) Explore the compatibility of peptide-appended pillar[5]arene channels with block copolymer membranes and use this knowledge to maximize channel packing; and, 3) Correlate the structure and transport properties of peptide-appended pillar[5]arene block copolymer membranes. The tunable pore size will allow application of these membranes across critical areas of water treatment and reuse including: 1) drinking water treatment, 2) brackish water and seawater desalination, and, 3) wastewater reuse. The compact nature of membrane technology will allow its implementation in decentralized treatment as well as in low footprint centralized treatment in dense urban areas. Overall, given the increasing pressure on water sources and the interconnectedness of energy, food, and water operations, success in the proposed program can have a significant impact on the food-energy-water nexus. The proposed program will utilize bioinspired membranes and their connection to water transport in natural systems, such as plants and the human body, to engage diverse students at all levels (K-12 though graduate) in multidisciplinary research and education activities. The three specific educational objectives of the proposed program are: 1) Provide early stage mentorship to a diverse multidisciplinary group of engineering undergraduates (UGs) through first year seminars and research engagement; 2) Evaluate four UG research engagement models common at universities; and 3) Expand and diversify a current water-science-based K-12 summer camp and assess its impact on participants."

Nanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate matter systematically at the nanoscale, creating uniquely functional materials that can be inorganic, organic or biological, or a hybrid of any two or more of these. Consequently, nanoscience and nanotechnology pose formidable challenges that cut across traditionally distinct disciplines. Clearly, to meet these demands, the training of future scientists and engineers in the broad field of nanotechnology is of paramount importance. The interdisciplinary nature of nanoscale science and engineering means it inherently involves all of the sciences and engineering, including medicine, resulting in the need to train students at all levels in an interdisciplinary manner. To achieve this goal the Vanderbilt Institute for Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE) summer REU site will offer STEM undergraduate students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in the field of nanoscale science and engineering. VINSE faculty will provide REU students with a true interdisciplinary research experience in an environment where physicists, chemists, biologists, and all engineers collaboratively solve problems and create new scientific understanding."

These ectomycorrhizal fungi provide resources to the plant host, and in return, the plant provides nutrition to the fungi. The interactions of fungi and their hosts provide crucial ecosystem functions including the recycling of nutrients. While the critical roles that fungi play in the environment are well established, their importance in tropical systems is not well understood, and this is especially true for tropical Africa. This project in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest will provide the first thorough documentation of these fungi and plant relationships of tropical Africa using modern methods. The huge forest covering the Congo River basin is one of the last great tropical rainforests of the world. Current threats to the region include logging, mining, and climate change. This project will fill a major gap in our knowledge of the important symbiotic fungi of this ecosystem through expeditionary fieldwork in the undisturbed rainforests of Cameroon. This project is potentially transformative in that if the fungi associated with closely related host plants of Africa and South America are shown to have a common ancient origin, such results would fundamentally impact understanding of the evolution, global biogeography, and local adaptation of ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Additionally, application of new DNA sequencing methods will develop entirely new, phylogenetically informative data that will transform the field. It is estimated that over 100 fungi will be discovered that are new to science. Recognition of these species will greatly inform broader research areas. Key features of the project include student training, internet-based information sharing, and public outreach. <br/><br/>By combining traditional specimen-based sampling with high throughput DNA sequencing, this project will provide the most complete diversity data to date on ectomycorrhizal fungi of Afrotropical forests. Additionally, it will enable comparison of intercontinental tropical ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in corresponding ecosystems. The research will enhance understanding of fungal biogeography in the Gondwana-derived Afrotropical and Neotropical Guiana Shield regions. Survey plots identical to those used for surveys in the Guiana Shield of South America will be established in the Dja Biosphere Reserve and Korup National Park Cameroon and ectomycorrhizal fungi will be sampled using morphological and molecular methods over multiple years. Replication of sample design allows for direct comparisons between Africa and South America, allowing for robust biogeographic analyses to determine the evolutionary histories of ectomycorrhizal taxa in a global context."

Endocannabinoids are signaling molecules derived from fatty acids that appeared early in evolution and play important roles in regulating numerous physiological processes including those that are altered in hibernation such as bone, fat, and energy metabolism. The research aims to understand how endocannabinoid signaling by fat cells affects bone remodeling in obese, but otherwise healthy hibernating marmots.  The planned studies will provide research experiences for undergraduate students to prepare them for advanced education and careers in science. The educational outreach component of this award will help students understand how diet and exercise affect fat accumulation and overall health of organisms. It will also elucidate how some animals have evolved physiological systems that prevent disease during states of obesity and physical inactivity. It will develop an interactive exhibit for K-12  students to explore the differences between the metabolism and physical activity of a hibernating animal and themselves.  It will develop research kits for middle school students to measure and understand the calorie content of specific foods. It will also develop a presentation on the unique physiological adaptations in hibernators to underserved K-5 students. <br/><br/>Hibernating mammals demonstrate remarkable resilience by having evolved physiological mechanisms that allow them to survive extreme physiological and environmental conditions for prolonged periods of time. Physical inactivity, obesity, and anorexia are well known to negatively impact bone metabolism and structure in non-hibernating animals.  However, the physical inactivity, obesity, and anorexia that occur during hibernation do not negatively affect bone in marmots. The research will investigate the role of the endocannabinoid system in preventing bone loss in hibernating marmots. The research will test the general hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system regulates bone metabolism during hibernation to prevent bone loss. The project will undertake an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the role of paracrine signaling from bone marrow adipocytes in endocannabinoid regulated bone metabolism during hibernation. Novel targeted mass spectrometry methodology to measure tissue levels of endocannabinoid ligands, with greater sensitivity than previously reported, will be used to measure endocannabinoid levels in marmot serum, bone, and adipose tissue. Pharmacological blocking will be used to assess the role of specific components of the endocannabinoid system in regulating bone remodeling and structure during hibernation. Additionally, the methodology and results from the study will provide the conceptual framework for modeling how the endocannabinoid system regulates metabolism in other physiological systems during the extreme conditions of hibernation."

Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.<br/><br/>Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies."

This research will investigate a striking case in a group of trees and shrubs (Viburnum) in which rapid differentiation appears to have occurred repeatedly into two radically different plant forms. Major differences in the leaves of these plants appear to have resulted from adaptation to adjacent forest types that differ subtly in environmental variables. The evident replication of this process in several different mountain regions throughout the New World tropics, provides a rare opportunity to critically test a model of rapid ecological speciation. Detailed studies of adjacent plant populations will be carried out in different mountain regions in Mexico with the aim of identifying the environmental factors and the nature of the variation within populations that have favored the rapid evolution of these leaf traits. It should also be possible to identify genes that underlie these key plant characteristics by taking advantage of natural hybridization between these species. These studies will yield general insights into speciation but also into the adaptive significance of the leaf traits that differentiate related species throughout the flowering plants. This research will be carried out in collaboration with Mexican scientists and will involve multiple undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities have been designed to foster interactions between participants from the United States and Mexico.  <br/><br/>This project focuses specifically on understanding the drivers of speciation in three species pairs in the mountains of Eastern and Southern Mexico. The two species in each pair differ dramatically in leaf size and shape (large and round versus small and elliptical), in leaf margins (toothed versus smooth), and in leaf pubescence (densely hairy versus lacking hairs). The research will focus on quantifying variation within individual plants, within populations, and between the species pairs, and on determining the abiotic and biotic factors that differ between their forest habitats. Hypotheses on the adaptive value of the leaf variables will be tested using transects between adjacent habitats and a reciprocal transplant experiment.  In areas that have long been disturbed by indigenous agricultural practices, extensive hybridization has resulted in a wide array of intermediate leaf forms.  Molecular analyses of these hybrid swarms should allow the identification of the major genes that underlie differences in leaf form. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering."

However, before these goals can be realized, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating their fate is required. Stem cells integrate the many signals that surround them and execute cellular behaviors based on these inputs. These attributes can be harnessed and manipulated using synthetic biology to tightly control gene expression in dynamic patterns, in addition to programming cells to sense and record changes in their microenvironment.  Upon successful completion, this work will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in stem cell fate decisions that may eventually be exploited to direct differentiation.<br/><br/>Both intrinsic (transcription factor expression), as well as extrinsic (environmental) mechanisms are thought to be involved in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal, and their commitment to differentiate into more specialized cell types. This interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic cues in differentiation poses challenges to studying the mechanisms involved in their proliferation and terminal differentiation. These challenges can be addressed using genetic circuits. The completion of this research will produce tools to query the different timings, identities, and interactions of the internal and external signals of cell fate. This will be accomplished by developing strategies for probing stem cell differentiation using genetic circuits with the following objectives: (1) to expand the genetic toolbox for dynamically controlling gene expression in mammalian cells, (2) to assess changes in the extracellular microenvironment as stem cells differentiate by connecting genetic circuits to important receptors known to be involved in cell fate choices, and (3) to use these tools to probe stem cell differentiation.  All of the results of this research will be made accessible to the research community. An additional important broad impact area of this research program is education and outreach of STEM fields at a variety of levels including elementary school, high school, and undergraduate students."

Termed Nanoscale Organic Hybrid Materials (NOHMs), they are the first example of an organic-inorganic hybrid material in which each nanoscale building block is itself a hybrid. This design provides opportunities for scientific exploration and for engineering new materials with unusual combinations of properties that take advantage of the large library of available nanostructures and polymers for manipulating physical properties and function. Research in this study considers a particular family of NOHMs in which the corona is comprised of lithium-ion conducting polymers. This focus is motivated by the potential such materials hold for creating battery electrolytes with high, liquid-like ionic conductivity, tunable mechanical properties, and non-flammability under normal operating conditions for batteries. The work is important because it will enable batteries to safely utilize energetic metals as their anodes and to offer substantial increases in the amount of energy stored. Aspects of this promise have already been realized with the creation of a technology start-up company, NOHMs Technologies, which currently employs 14 persons. It is expected that further technological development may occur over the four-year performance period of this NSF award as fundamental understanding of the materials grow and as this understanding leads to new non-flammable electrolyte designs that can be used as drop-in replacements for currently used flammable battery electrolytes. The flexible design of NOHMs in multiple, easy-to-appreciate applications of broad-based societal interest (including batteries, 3D printing, and advanced lubricants) also provides important opportunities for introducing younger students (K-12) to nanotechnology. The project will engage these students and their teachers through demonstrations based on batteries. These demonstrations will be designed to teach students to think about batteries as chemical reactors that produce electrical energy as the principal product, and about the relationship between applications-oriented properties and the basic chemical and physical processes that must be understood and controlled to achieve them.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>This project focuses on structure, component dynamics, and ion transport in Nanoscale Organic Hybrid Materials (NOHMs) created by densely tethering short polymer chains to inorganic nanostructures. A consequence of the design of NOHMs is that grafted polymer (corona) segments experience an entropic attractive force created by the constraint that segments must homogeneously fill the space between nanoparticle cores. This entropic force is currently believed to be responsible for at least three effects: (i) strong correlations of the cores, (ii) physical constraints analogous to cross-links on the corona, and (iii) suppressed density fluctuations on large length-scales, which causes the materials to exhibit low-wave vector structure distinct from conventional hard-sphere suspensions, but analogous to incompressible molecular fluids. On continuum length-scales the materials behave as soft glassy complex fluids in which each suspended particle carries around a share of the suspending medium at all times. In contrast, on nanometer length scales, they are granular. By isolating and studying contributions to NOHMs physical properties from surface crowding of corona chains, geometric confinement of corona chains between neighboring particles, entropy-mediated temporary cross-links between corona, and slow translation and reorientation dynamics of correlated cores, the proposed study will determine how interactions between corona polymer chains influence structure, rheology, and ion transport properties of the materials. The work will also explore phase stability, dynamics and ion transport in NOHMs, NOHMs/NOHMs blends, and NOHMs polymer blends. The proposed study aims to construct a physical model framework for understanding NOHMs transport behaviors and rheology."

In this ecosystem, epiphytes play important ecosystem roles because they intercept and hold on to nutrients and water from rain and mist and provide food and resources for many birds, animals and insects. Because these plants do not have access to soils and water from the ground, they are particularly vulnerable to changes in climate, including increases in cloud height and drought. This research will determine the degree to which epiphyte communities are vulnerable to decreases in precipitation or cloud cover, and increased forest fragmentation. This project will also develop a training program in canopy ecology for ecotourism operators in Monteverde, Costa Rica. This region hosts over 100,000 people per year for canopy adventure sports but few tourists or guides get information on the importance of the TMCF in general and the epiphyte community specifically. The team will also provide training and presentations to local research and educational institutions in the Monteverde region including the Monteverde Reserve, the Monteverde Institute and local high schools.<br/><br/>Despite evidence that the canopy community as a whole is important to ecosystem processes, there is little information regarding the ability of this community to withstand projected changes in climate and/or increases in exposure due to deforestation. In the TMCF, there is great variation in growth forms in the canopy that may differ in their vulnerability to decreases in precipitation or increases in cloud base heights. Although efforts have been made to understand individual species responses to drought stress, little is known about variability in drought-stress responses and the ability of plants to cope with projected future drought conditions. By working in this hyper-diverse, but relatively understudied system, this research will increase the understanding of a fundamental topic in plant ecophysiology: the diverse ways plants respond to drought. Variability in microclimate across the six sites provides a unique opportunity to identify suites of drought-stress responses across functional groups and determine whether these traits vary, or respond plastically, to changes in the environment. Functional morphological traits, water relations, water use, and vulnerability to drought will be measured across the gradient to document variation in ecophysiological strategies in plants that are exposed to different microclimates. Photosynthetic strategies will also be evaluated along the gradient using stable isotopes. Canopy communities in open pasture trees will also be studied because these exposed communities tend to experience greater water stress within a given precipitation regime and may provide insights on how canopy communities are likely to be affected by increases in drought stress or forest fragmentation. To assess the role of suites of functional traits on drought resistance, a subset of common species from three of the sites (wettest, intermediate, driest) from both forests and pastures will be subjected to a manipulative drought experiment."

The first part builds a data set of nanotechnology firms in the U.S. by integrating several sources and includes detailed information about each firm, its participation in venture development programs, and the firms? outcomes.  This part of the study provides insight into the types of firms that participate in the different programs.  The next part of the study statistically examines how the participation in a program influences firm success. Multiple positive and negative firm outcomes are included such as business closure, bankruptcy, liquidation, acquisition, follow-on funding, and initial public offering to develop rich insights into these programs.  The last part of this study asks firm founders about their participation in venture development programs and how their engagement of the programs influenced their firms? outcomes. Thus, this research expands our understanding of how technology firm founders can influence the longevity of their firms by participating in venture development programs.

Catalysts are vital in many industrial and laboratory chemical processes. Many catalysts involve a metal atom that contains a reactive center that can facilitate chemical reactions. However, this reactive center, itself, can be prone to reactions that can deactivate it. This project involves the development of ligands (groups that are attached to a metal) that contain one portion that is firmly bonded to the metal and another that can be relatively easily removed from the metal to open a reactive site. These ligands are called hemilabile ligands. The hemilabile ligands targeted contain a group that can bind to an external positive ion that remove that group from the metal. This permits a balance of activity and stability that advances catalysis relevant to the pharmaceutical and commodity chemical industries. The educational approach focuses on communication in chemistry. Graduate students are participating in a science communication initiative in collaboration with a local science center, the Morehead Planetarium, creating hands-on activities that illustrate the role of catalysis in everyday life. The Safety Net is also being established as an online network of safety resources to encourage communication between academic and industrial scientists.  <br/><br/>The research approach utilizes new ""pincer-crown ether"" ligands that contain a macrocylic cation receptor site to modulate reactivity. Mechanistic studies are establishing the parameters that allow cations to tune individual organometallic reactions steps, supporting the development of catalysts that exhibit distinct activity and selectivity in the presence of various cations. The combined education and research program is training graduate students in catalysis research, safe laboratory practices, and science communication with the public."

These ectomycorrhizal fungi provide resources to the plant host, and in return, the plant provides nutrition to the fungi. The interactions of fungi and their hosts provide crucial ecosystem functions including the recycling of nutrients. While the critical roles that fungi play in the environment are well established, their importance in tropical systems is not well understood, and this is especially true for tropical Africa. This project in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest will provide the first thorough documentation of these fungi and plant relationships of tropical Africa using modern methods.  The huge forest covering the Congo River basin is one of the last great tropical rainforests of the world. Current threats to the region include logging, mining, and climate change. This project will fill a major gap in our knowledge of the important symbiotic fungi of this ecosystem through expeditionary fieldwork in the undisturbed rainforests of Cameroon. This project is potentially transformative in that if the fungi associated with closely related host plants of Africa and South America are shown to have a common ancient origin, such results would fundamentally impact understanding of the evolution, global biogeography, and local adaptation of ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Additionally, application of new DNA sequencing methods will develop entirely new, phylogenetically informative data that will transform the field. It is estimated that over 100 fungi will be discovered that are new to science. Recognition of these species will greatly inform broader research areas. Key features of the project include student training, internet-based information sharing, and public outreach. <br/><br/>By combining traditional specimen-based sampling with high throughput DNA sequencing, this project will provide the most complete diversity data to date on ectomycorrhizal fungi of Afrotropical forests.  Additionally, it will enable comparison of intercontinental tropical ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in corresponding ecosystems. The research will enhance understanding of fungal biogeography in the Gondwana-derived Afrotropical and Neotropical Guiana Shield regions. Survey plots identical to those used for surveys in the Guiana Shield of South America will be established in the Dja Biosphere Reserve and Korup National Park Cameroon and ectomycorrhizal fungi will be sampled using morphological and molecular methods over multiple years. Replication of sample design allows for direct comparisons between Africa and South America, allowing for robust biogeographic analyses to determine the evolutionary histories of ectomycorrhizal taxa in a global context."

Unfortunately, quantifying these processes and assessing their effect on the N cycle is difficult by direct measurements because of large spatial and temporal differences.  Isotopic composition measurements of N provide a means to constrain these processes indirectly; however, there is still a great deal to be understood about isotope fractionation of recycled nitrogen through biological processes, which has made interpretation of novel nitrogen isotope data difficult. A researcher from the University of Connecticut plans to determine the influence of biological consumption and production on the isotope fractionation in ammonium.  By helping to understand the processes surrounding fractionation of recycled ammonium at the organism level, this research will create a basis for which future researchers can better interpret isotope composition data to infer nitrogen cycle dynamics. A graduate student, a postdoctoral fellow, and two or more undergraduate students will be involved in the research. The researcher plans to integrate science with community-engaged learning by developing an undergraduate field and laboratory course that will require the students to present their research to stakeholders in the community. There will be a manual created for this course that will be disseminated in open-access forums for teachers hoping to develop similar courses. <br/><br/>Biological nitrogen isotope fractionation associated with nitrogen recycling remains poorly constrained despite the advent of a variety of new techniques to analyze nitrogen isotopes in recent years. The use of isotopic composition data can be incredibly useful to interpreting nitrogen cycle processes in the ocean that are difficult to measure directly, which makes it crucial to further understand the processes behind fractionation to catch up with the advancement of the datasets available to researchers. This research will characterize the isotope fractionation dynamics of ammonium during biological consumption and production. The researchers will investigate whether the characteristic low concentrations of ammonium in the surface ocean affect isotope fractionation when the ammonium is recycled and whether there is a trophic isotope effect associated with ammonium recycling by protozoan grazers. With this research, there will be a baseline from which researchers can interpret recycled nitrogen dynamics from ammonium isotope datasets. The methods of comparing nitrogen cycling studies will become significantly clearer with such a standard making interpretation uniform by removing significant uncertainties."

The farming of fungi has evolved in at least 12 different bark beetle groups, and these groups have radiated into more than 3,500 species. Despite the evolutionary success of this relationship, estimates suggest that the identity of the fungal symbiont is unknown for over 90% of beetles. Global movement of wood products has made many ambrosia beetles invasive, and many of the symbiotic fungi have become pathogens to tree crops. This project will document the ambrosia beetle-fungal symbiosis and characterize the fungal community for each ambrosia beetle genus using new molecular and culturing techniques. Two graduate students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques. The project will also disseminate research findings through an exhibit of beetle calligraphy at the Harn Museum of Modern Art in Gainesville, FL, and a national citizen science project entitled 'Backyard Bark Beetles'. Researchers will also enhance international collaboration and infrastructure by running an ambrosia beetle identification workshop in tropical Asia to help inspectors identify the most invasive species.<br/><br/>The first aim of this project is to comprehensively sample ambrosia beetle-fungal symbioses to investigate the level of symbiont specificity. Three globally-invasive ambrosia beetle-fungus complexes will then be sampled to investigate how the fungal symbiont community has changed over time following vector dispersal, invasion, and contact with new communities. The third and ultimate goal of the project is to use phylogenetic and comparative methods to reconstruct the pattern of ambrosia beetle-fungus coevolution. With new data on fungus communities, it will be possible to compare the influence of beetle phylogeny, geographic origin, latitude and other factors on beetle-fungus relationships. This project will implement a series of methods to achieve the research goals, including high-throughput DNA metabarcoding, a new 'RNA metabarcoding' approach to investigate fungal metabolic prominence, and a RADseq-based approach to reconstruct population genetic history, Together, this research will produce a comprehensive dataset on the identity and movements of ambrosia and their fungal symbionts in both their native and invaded regions that will provide essential baseline data to help control the global impact of both ambrosia beetles and ambrosia fungi."

In this ecosystem, epiphytes play important ecosystem roles because they intercept and hold on to nutrients and water from rain and mist and provide food and resources for many birds, animals and insects. Because these plants do not have access to soils and water from the ground, they are particularly vulnerable to changes in climate, including increases in cloud height and drought. This research will determine the degree to which epiphyte communities are vulnerable to decreases in precipitation or cloud cover, and increased forest fragmentation. This project will also develop a training program in canopy ecology for ecotourism operators in Monteverde, Costa Rica. This region hosts over 100,000 people per year for canopy adventure sports but few tourists or guides get information on the importance of the TMCF in general and the epiphyte community specifically. The team will also provide training and presentations to local research and educational institutions in the Monteverde region including the Monteverde Reserve, the Monteverde Institute and local high schools.<br/><br/>Despite evidence that the canopy community as a whole is important to ecosystem processes, there is little information regarding the ability of this community to withstand projected changes in climate and/or increases in exposure due to deforestation. In the TMCF, there is great variation in growth forms in the canopy that may differ in their vulnerability to decreases in precipitation or increases in cloud base heights. Although efforts have been made to understand individual species responses to drought stress, little is known about variability in drought-stress responses and the ability of plants to cope with projected future drought conditions. By working in this hyper-diverse, but relatively understudied system, this research will increase the understanding of a fundamental topic in plant ecophysiology: the diverse ways plants respond to drought. Variability in microclimate across the six sites provides a unique opportunity to identify suites of drought-stress responses across functional groups and determine whether these traits vary, or respond plastically, to changes in the environment. Functional morphological traits, water relations, water use, and vulnerability to drought will be measured across the gradient to document variation in ecophysiological strategies in plants that are exposed to different microclimates. Photosynthetic strategies will also be evaluated along the gradient using stable isotopes. Canopy communities in open pasture trees will also be studied because these exposed communities tend to experience greater water stress within a given precipitation regime and may provide insights on how canopy communities are likely to be affected by increases in drought stress or forest fragmentation. To assess the role of suites of functional traits on drought resistance, a subset of common species from three of the sites (wettest, intermediate, driest) from both forests and pastures will be subjected to a manipulative drought experiment."

Smith (Cornell University), along with collaborators in Armenia, will investigate the relationship between warfare, settlement patterns, and political development in the ancient past. Traditional social science scholarship on pre-modern warfare has typically framed conflict as a rational pursuit of material needs, or as a strategic contest among aspiring elites seeking political advantage in the evolution toward political complexity. However, archaeology is well-positioned to offer a more nuanced perspective of ancient warfare that focuses on the broader fields of social action and historical contexts that shape the motivations, goals, and cultural practices of war. This research will contribute essential time depth to the study of contemporary regional conflicts, their impacts on the politics and identities of social groups, and the ties to place and polity. As persistent ethnic and civil clashes continue to impact contemporary life, understanding the impact of war in the past can help frame the causes and implications of modern conflicts while shaping responses to them. This research will contribute to actionable scholarly efforts to understand the long-term impacts on human political, economic, and settlement practices and subjectivities that emerge within fortified and militarized landscapes.<br/><br/>The ubiquity of stone hillforts in the South Caucasus and the prevalence of metal weapons indicate that violence played an essential role in regional sociopolitical development. Dr. Lindsay and his co-investigators will study the institutional mechanisms through which warfare constituted authority, created and dissolved political association, and shaped a specific form of political economy during the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age periods (ca. 1500-200 BC). The researchers will examine the role of violence and warfare in community formation, social order, and sociopolitical boundaries through a diachronic study of fortified landscapes in the upper Kasakh River valley of northwestern Armenia. In particular, they will address questions regarding how the history of fortress construction and abandonment inform models of political association, what types of violent practices in these areas are evidenced in burial goods and inscribed on human skeletal remains, and how patterns of politics and warfare in the Caucasus correlate with regional environmental shifts and historical change in the neighboring Near East and Eurasian Steppe.  The research team will employ a battery of traditional and cutting-edge archaeological approaches to address these issues, including pedestrian and magnetometry survey; the use of drones for aerial photogrammetry of fortresses and associated settlements; test excavation of burials and forts; pollen analysis of a bog core to reconstruct paleoenvironmental contexts; analysis of human remains to study demography, trauma, diet, mobility, and social identity; and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and digital radiography on pottery materials to illuminate preliminary patterns of goods circulation. Combined, these techniques will provide the groundwork for a robust evaluation of the long-term engagement of warfare and sociopolitical life in the South Caucasus. In addition, this research will facilitate the training of a new generation of archaeologists in a range of advanced research methods, which will help improve the research infrastructure of scholarship in a region that remains economically disadvantaged."

This region is home to some of the world's most charismatic wildlife species, but it is also a disease hotspot that is currently undergoing continued development and expanded ranching and cattle practices in wildlife zones. This project will seek to quantify the effect of watering points on parasite density, as mediated by animal movement, and to understand how climate and host community play a role in disease risk at water points across the landscape. <br/><br/>The project entails four distinct components that integrate extensive observational surveys, experimental manipulations, and mathematical modelling. The first component involves a survey of 20 dams and control sites across a steep rainfall gradient in Laikipia County, central Kenya. Dung surveys, tick drags, camera trapping, vegetation surveys, and soil and water analyses will be used to determine the density of animals and their parasites at both watering holes and control sites over rainfall seasons. The second component will utilize paired water pans used by wildlife and cattle: one water pan in each pair will be drained for two rainfall seasons before being refilled, and all surveys listed above will be repeated for this experiment. The third component will utilize animal exclosure plots at water sources to determine the effect of large mammal loss on parasite density in the landscape. Finally, mathematical models parameterized with field data will be used to simulate the transmission of fecal-oral parasites over different climates and seasons for a range of hosts. The effect of water availability and distribution on animal movement and disease prevalence will be tested, providing valuable insight to both land managers and scientists on the complex system of water, hosts, and parasites."

Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.<br/><br/>Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies."

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in tale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

The biocatalytic production of hydrocarbons provides a potential route to sustainably produce fuels that are compatible within the existing energy infrastructure.  The atypical reaction catalyzed by OleT consumes hydrogen peroxide, a toxic reactive oxygen species, and transforms biologically abundant fatty acids into alkenes without any additional input of energy.  The goal of this research is to understand both the chemistry of this reaction, and the molecular details which promote it.  Additional broader impacts of this research are in its active involvement of undergraduate and high school students, and the community at large, in an ongoing protein engineering initiative that introduces this hydrocarbon producing capacity into a related enzyme.  The award also supports research for undergraduates from the home institution, and abroad, through a collaborative exchange with a liberal arts college for women, and provides the first research opportunities to high-school students from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The cytochromes P450 are a ubiquitously expressed superfamily of thiolate-ligated heme enzymes that catalyze a diverse set of physiologically important chemical reactions.  Cytochrome P450 enzymes typically insert oxygen atoms into organic substrates using a ferryl intermediate known as Compound I.  OleT forms Compound I, but instead catalyzes a fundamentally different reaction that does not involve oxygen insertion.  The origins for this unusual metal-oxo reprogramming are being probed by biochemical, kinetics, spectroscopic and structural methods.  These methodologies evaluate the individual contributions of electronic structure, secondary coordination sphere, and substrate positioning on promoting the carbon-carbon scission reaction.  Dr. Makris has devised an innovative educational plan, termed Fats to Fuels, that is well integrated into the proposed studies of OleT.  In this plan, undergraduate students and the local community are engaged in learning how fats can be converted to hydrocarbon fuel sources. This research has the potential to impact society with respect to developing new hydrocarbon sources as alternatives to fossil fuels."

However, relying solely on the sensations that result from movement would be insufficient to quickly adjust and update future motor plans due to the inherent delays in the communication and processing within the central nervous system. There is strong behavioral evidence that to ensure sufficient control the brain uses information about the issued motor commands to form a prediction of the expected sensations that result from body motion. Despite this evidence, it remains largely unknown how the brain combines these predictions of sensory feedback with actual motion-induced sensations for movement control and self-movement perception. This CAREER proposal, through student involvement and outreach activities, lays the foundation for a long-term research and educational career to address these gaps in knowledge. Utilizing a diverse set of techniques, the investigator will systematically examine the contributions of actual and predicted sensory feedback to upper limb behavior.<br/><br/>Corollary discharge (CD, also referred to as efference copy) is the internal duplicate of a motor command made at the same time the motor signal is generated. This signal is used to predict the future state of the body and the expected sensory consequences due to movement. The integration of this internal state information with delayed sensory signals is critical for accurate movement control and motion perception. However, little is known about the properties of this signal in humans or how this internal movement information is integrated with reafferent sensory feedback. Despite being poorly understood, internal state estimation remains a critical feature of computational models of limb movement and feedforward control. To directly address the current gaps in knowledge, the proposed studies aim to (1) quantify the accuracy and sensitivity of proprioception and internal limb state estimation, (2) computationally describe how these signals are combined to aid perception and motor coordination, and (3) determine the causal relationships between behavior and the neural processing of these signals through the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation to areas within the parietal cortex and cerebellum. Pursuing the project goals will utilize different techniques (computational modeling, noninvasive neural stimulation and quantitative behavioral analysis) in order to advance the computational frameworks for sensorimotor integration and control. Increasing the understanding of this neural integration could potentially (1) provide the foundation for understanding how actual and predicted sensory information contribute to complex behaviors (e.g., eye-hand and bimanual coordination), (2) help define the constraints (e.g., timing and acuity) of the different sensory information required for effective neural prostheses and brain?machine interface control and (3) assist in distinguishing the basis of feedforward motor control deficits in several neurological diseases. Importantly, the project promotes the inclusion and training of students from various backgrounds, particularly minority students, and encourages the outreach and dissemination of the scientific research to a broad spectrum of participants within the community, from grade school students to retired individuals."

The research is integrated with an educational plan that introduces molecular level simulation concepts to students across levels ranging from high school to graduate research.<br/><br/>Theoretical understanding of catalytic materials and processes has advanced significantly in recent years due to rapid improvements in computer resources. This theoretical understanding is streamlining the process of catalyst discovery and moving the field of catalysis toward the prediction of new processes and materials and away from the traditional trial-and-error approach.  However, this transition has been slow in the area of liquid phase catalysis, especially electrocatalysis, in large part because of incomplete understanding of the interactions that occur between fluid molecules and the catalyst surface.  The research proposed here will take a large step toward better understanding these interactions by considering their free energies, whereas prior treatments have only considered their enthalpies.  Traditional modeling equations will be refined and extended by adding, for the first time, free energy contributions due to rotation, translation, and interaction occurring between liquid-phase molecules and species adsorbed to the catalyst surface.  The refined models will then be directed toward understanding the reaction between liquid water and gaseous nitrogen in an electrocatalytic environment to produce ammonia under near-ambient temperature and pressure conditions.  The improved simulation models will pave the way for a more rational approach to catalyst discovery across a broad range of liquid phase catalytic reactions, and the educational materials will train coming generations of students in molecular-level phenomena and the effective use of molecular simulation tools."

Smith (Cornell University), along with collaborators in Armenia, will investigate the relationship between warfare, settlement patterns, and political development in the ancient past. Traditional social science scholarship on pre-modern warfare has typically framed conflict as a rational pursuit of material needs, or as a strategic contest among aspiring elites seeking political advantage in the evolution toward political complexity. However, archaeology is well-positioned to offer a more nuanced perspective of ancient warfare that focuses on the broader fields of social action and historical contexts that shape the motivations, goals, and cultural practices of war. This research will contribute essential time depth to the study of contemporary regional conflicts, their impacts on the politics and identities of social groups, and the ties to place and polity. As persistent ethnic and civil clashes continue to impact contemporary life, understanding the impact of war in the past can help frame the causes and implications of modern conflicts while shaping responses to them. This research will contribute to actionable scholarly efforts to understand the long-term impacts on human political, economic, and settlement practices and subjectivities that emerge within fortified and militarized landscapes.<br/><br/>The ubiquity of stone hillforts in the South Caucasus and the prevalence of metal weapons indicate that violence played an essential role in regional sociopolitical development. Dr. Lindsay and his co-investigators will study the institutional mechanisms through which warfare constituted authority, created and dissolved political association, and shaped a specific form of political economy during the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age periods (ca. 1500-200 BC). The researchers will examine the role of violence and warfare in community formation, social order, and sociopolitical boundaries through a diachronic study of fortified landscapes in the upper Kasakh River valley of northwestern Armenia. In particular, they will address questions regarding how the history of fortress construction and abandonment inform models of political association, what types of violent practices in these areas are evidenced in burial goods and inscribed on human skeletal remains, and how patterns of politics and warfare in the Caucasus correlate with regional environmental shifts and historical change in the neighboring Near East and Eurasian Steppe.  The research team will employ a battery of traditional and cutting-edge archaeological approaches to address these issues, including pedestrian and magnetometry survey; the use of drones for aerial photogrammetry of fortresses and associated settlements; test excavation of burials and forts; pollen analysis of a bog core to reconstruct paleoenvironmental contexts; analysis of human remains to study demography, trauma, diet, mobility, and social identity; and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and digital radiography on pottery materials to illuminate preliminary patterns of goods circulation. Combined, these techniques will provide the groundwork for a robust evaluation of the long-term engagement of warfare and sociopolitical life in the South Caucasus. In addition, this research will facilitate the training of a new generation of archaeologists in a range of advanced research methods, which will help improve the research infrastructure of scholarship in a region that remains economically disadvantaged."

This region is home to some of the world's most charismatic wildlife species, but it is also a disease hotspot that is currently undergoing continued development and expanded ranching and cattle practices in wildlife zones. This project will seek to quantify the effect of watering points on parasite density, as mediated by animal movement, and to understand how climate and host community play a role in disease risk at water points across the landscape. <br/><br/>The project entails four distinct components that integrate extensive observational surveys, experimental manipulations, and mathematical modelling. The first component involves a survey of 20 dams and control sites across a steep rainfall gradient in Laikipia County, central Kenya. Dung surveys, tick drags, camera trapping, vegetation surveys, and soil and water analyses will be used to determine the density of animals and their parasites at both watering holes and control sites over rainfall seasons. The second component will utilize paired water pans used by wildlife and cattle: one water pan in each pair will be drained for two rainfall seasons before being refilled, and all surveys listed above will be repeated for this experiment. The third component will utilize animal exclosure plots at water sources to determine the effect of large mammal loss on parasite density in the landscape. Finally, mathematical models parameterized with field data will be used to simulate the transmission of fecal-oral parasites over different climates and seasons for a range of hosts. The effect of water availability and distribution on animal movement and disease prevalence will be tested, providing valuable insight to both land managers and scientists on the complex system of water, hosts, and parasites."

For most of human history, anthropogenic effects on forest ecosystems unfolded slowly over long periods of time. But now scientists are observing changes in forest cover that occur over mere decades, dramatically accelerated by such human activities as large-scale agriculture and road construction. With growing concern over the loss of biodiversity worldwide, scientific research on global land use change has emphasized the environmentally destructive impacts of human colonization and settlement, especially in the tropics where recent human arrivals often lack the institutions and techniques to counter the effects of commercial agriculture and logging and keep forests standing. However, while some scientists have modeled deforestation as the direct result of the expansion of agriculture, others have argued that not all farming is the same and that small-scale agroecological farming methods can actually reduce deforestation and enhance biodiversity while still using the forests productively. A critical question for forest ecosystems is how the social organization of livelihoods and institutions can encourage new relationships to emerge between agriculture and biodiversity. To date, research on socio-ecological systems has tended to focus on traditional environmental management, paying less attention to shifts between types of land use as a function of evolving social organization on market peripheries. But better knowledge of these latter dynamics is critically needed: U.S. and state policies for mitigating climate change involve international incentives to reduce tropical deforestation but lack necessary understanding of social and livelihood development processes for the populations that inhabit the forests. <br/><br/>To further these understandings, this project will analyze an observed change in tropical forest cover that counters conventional wisdom: unusually, it involves a transition from deforestation to reforestation, rather than the other way around, despite having been subject to colonization since 1970. Davenport will assess how livelihoods, institutional arrangements, and cultivation decisions have variously impacted land use changes in time and space. The site of the research is the municipality of Medicilndia on the TransAmazon highway in Brazil, which has seen many of its small farmer majority population develop manual labor intensive and species diverse agroforestry systems with cacao trees (Theobroma cacao) and aai palms (Euterpe oleracea). While deforestation has continued apace in other areas of Medicilndia located farther from the highway, most land inside a ten kilometer range, deforested a quarter-century ago, is today either a forest farm or a regrowth secondary forest. The researcher will compare socio-ecological interactions on farms with distinct land use change trajectories. Three questions will be used to guide the analysis. First, how have the rural poor adapted distinct livelihood strategies over time, and involving what labor, logistical, subsistence and commercial arrangements? Second, how have institutions, colonist outlooks and attitudes shaped rules and norms concerning the land? The latter involves land tenure rights, local social organization and the evolving relationship of the locality with state agencies and regulatory systems, including the national Brazilian forest code. Third, how have agroecological techniques and species cultivation decisions varied in relation to livelihood and institutional factors, and what land use change has resulted? Quantitative and qualitative datasets will be constructed using survey, ethnographic and ethnobotanical methods; these will be integrated with remote sensing analysis of 30 years of satellite images and aerial photography to map and model human shaping of the environment over time."

However, most engineers graduating from engineering degree programs are more alike in their problem solving approaches, ways of thinking, and engineering identities than different in their skills as innovative thinkers. Students who do not conform to this mold of ""being an engineer"" are often alienated from engineering, do not develop engineering identities, and leave engineering, which reduces the much-needed human potential for innovation. This project responds to these challenges by characterizing and empirically understanding how to support students' innovative mindsets and engineering identities. These underlying differences are termed latent diversity, attributes that are present as potential sources for innovation, but are not visible or actualized. The outcomes of this work will help create more inclusive college classrooms that accept a wider set of students and produce engineers who can adopt various perspectives for innovative problem solutions. These diverse engineers will be more prepared to address the grand challenges of the 21st century. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to characterize how diverse students experience the culture of engineering and negotiate their identities as engineers. This research can actualize the power of students' alternative mindsets and ways of thinking for greater innovation in engineering solutions. It also expands traditional strands of research on diversity in engineering in complementary and transformative ways. This project uses mixed methods to determine: 1) what kinds of diversity in thought, innovation mindsets, and attitudes are present in engineering students; 2) how undergraduate students with latent diversity form engineering identities within an engineering community of practice over time; and 3) what support, both inside and outside of the classroom, can be provided to promote inclusion of students with latent diversity in engineering. To garner this insight, national survey data from first-year engineering students will be collected and latent diversity will be characterized by using topological data analysis. From these results, longitudinal narrative interviews with latently diverse students will be use to understand students' identity development and how this identity development is supported or hindered by their classroom experiences and institutional structure. These narratives will be analyzed both deductively (informed by identity-trajectory theory) and inductively (based on individual experiences) to propose a new theoretical framework of latent diversity that can be incorporated into researchers' and practitioners' ways of understanding how to educate engineering students. <br/><br/>The integrated education plan will implement pedagogies to support the development of latently diverse students in first-year engineering programs (a critical time point at which many talented students are lost from engineering programs). Workshops for educators, co-curricular support program staff, and engineering administrators and policy makers will be developed to reframe ways of thinking about engineering students and enact evidence-based practices that can support students both in and out of the classroom. This approach will provide key engineering education personnel with novel tools to develop a new generation of innovators. The integrated research and educational plan will directly impact the educational experiences of thousands of engineering students to develop innovative, rather than homogeneous, engineers."

Advances in DNA sequencing technology have transformed how scientists study these evolutionary and ecological aspects of microbial life by providing genetic insight into which types of microbes live in specific environments. However, less is understood about how microbes have evolved the ability to thrive in these environments. This research project uses innovative methods to integrate evolutionary and ecological information about microbes to determine how they have evolved in particular environments and to discover evolutionary groups of microbes that are essential to the ecosystem. This work is important because (1) it will provide researchers with the tools needed to understand how evolutionary and ecological forces influence microbial biodiversity, (2) it will facilitate effective preservation of microbial ecosystems and their services, and (3) is will provide a means of efficiently engineering communities of microbes that are industrially valuable. Further, this research will provide valuable, fundamental insights regarding the mechanisms by which microbes evolve within the context of their ecosystem. In terms of broader impacts, this work is valuable because the tools generated will benefit future investigators in developing more quantitative analyses and research plans. The research team will also convene an annual bioinformatics workshop intended to bring in more under-represented and first-generation students.<br/><br/>This project will develop a set of eco-phylogenetic methods for assessing how and why specific groups of microbes diversify. Specifically, this approach analyzes phylogenies assembled from a set of microbial communities and profiles the presence and abundance of each evolutionary group (clade) in each community. It then identifies clades whose phylogenetic and ecological distributions indicate that specific evolutionary or ecological mechanisms have influenced their diversification. This includes development of statistical and model-based procedures to assess the likelihood that non-random processes created the observed patterns in community composition, diversification and relatedness. Finally, it will apply these methods to the study of mammalian gut and plant leaf associated microbial communities to determine which microbial clades are critical to the structure of these communities, co-evolving with their host, and subject to evolutionarily conserved interactions with other microbial clades."

This study examines at a fundamental level how interactions between the supporting oxide material and the active noble metal can be engineered to control the stability and activity of isolated Rh atoms.  Insights from the work will be used to design catalysts with high selectivity in propylene hydroformylation - an important industrial reaction currently operated under homogeneous liquid-phase catalytic conditions.  A heterogeneous, gas-phase analog - as sought here - would offer a lower cost, environmentally friendly alternative.  Additionally, the research will provide opportunities for a broadly diverse student body at UC Riverside to develop both the analytical and communication skills needed for successful technical careers.<br/><br/>The project focuses on controlling the selectivity, reactivity, and stability of isolated metal atom catalysts by varying the oxide support and by functionalizing the support with organosilane moieties in ways that create electronic and steric structures that replicate those of single-metal-atom homogeneous catalysts.  Central to the study are a host of techniques involving synthesis, in-situ catalyst transformations, and analytical methods that will be utilized to create, confirm, and characterize the isolated atom sites and control their activity and stability.  Fundamental experiments will be carried out using probe molecule spectroscopy, probe reaction kinetics, in-situ spectroscopy and microscopy, and density functional theory calculations.  While the immediate focus will be on propylene hydroformylation, the associated fundamental understanding will benefit society through the design of heterogeneous catalytic processes that are more energy and environmentally friendly than homogeneous processes.  The highly multidisciplinary nature of the project will provide plentiful opportunities for students at this Hispanic serving institution to develop skills in presenting technical information based on carefully reasoned and structured scientific arguments."

Since 2010, the annual rate of funding growth has plateaued as humanitarian aid from development banks and governmental donors stagnates. In this financial landscape, the private (for-profit) sector has become increasingly involved in funding and implementing programs designed to improve global health. In some cases, multinational companies are stepping in to fill local governmental funding needs through their corporate social responsibility programs. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores what role the private sector's increasing involvement in humanitarian and development projects has had in shaping public health programs and the relationship that citizens have to corporations and governments. <br/><br/>Clare Cameron, under the supervision of Dr. Ian Whitmarsh of the University of California, San Francisco, examines the current trend toward 'public-private partnerships', collaborations between government and the private sector, as the new model for global health interventions. While the private sector's history of contributing to international development projects can be traced back to the early twentieth century, its current role and influence in shaping global health programs has gone largely unanalyzed. This research explores the implications of this move toward the privatization of public health projects in the context of a mining community in West Papua, Indonesia to ask: How does the increasing role of the private sector in providing public services influence how citizens newly relate to government? What new expectations of the private sector arise when a company, rather than government, is principally responsible for funding public services? As the multinational mining company in West Papua funds the overwhelming majority of health services for the local community, this site is uniquely situated to answer these questions. The researcher will use anthropological methods of participant-observation to join the public health team of a non-governmental organization that coordinates with local government to implement comprehensive community health services funded by the mining company. The researcher will also conduct interviews in two indigenous land-owning communities that are stakeholders in corporate social responsibility efforts.  This project will have broader impacts as health policies, both global and domestic, increasingly rely on public-private partnerships, and the potential long-term effects of these collaborations are not well understood. Results from this project are, thus, expected to influence how philanthropists, multinational corporations, and health professionals understand the impacts of contemporary practices of global humanitarianism and international development."

It is desirable to monitor the development using methods so that we understand their functionality and their character.  This project attempts to develop methods that will enable monitoring of the cells and cellular assemblies in three dimension.  This is the first time attempts will be made to measure at a cellular level in cellular assemblies with high time resolution.  <br/><br/>The goal is to develop nanomaterials-based platforms for enabling measurement and understanding of electrical signals transduction within cellular assemblies, such as cardiac and brain tissue. In order to do so, the specific focus of the proposed work is on understanding signal propagation in 3D microscale cellular assemblies such as induced pluripotent stem cells derived neurons and cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM). In pursuit of this goal of using a 3D nanosensor array platform will enable the testing of the hypothesis that the development of electrical activity is correlated to the maturation of induced iPS-CMs. The approach will be to exploit both the bottom-up and top-down synthesis and assembly of nanomaterials to develop a 3D sensor array. This would enable electrophysiology studies of complex cellular assemblies and will shed light on electrophysiology related disease deficiencies such as Parkinson?s disease and cardiac arrhythmias by allowing multisite and scale intracellular measurements. The research is expected to provide high spatial-temporal resolution interfaces with cells, multiplexed communication, and complex materials assemblies that form the interfaces. Knowing how electrical information propagates in a tissue will provide an understanding of how signals are transduced in 3D cellular assemblies. This will shed light on the relationship between electrical signals and reported diseases such as arrhythmias, and Parkinson's disease, and will enable us to develop tools to amend either injured neurons or heart muscle tissue. It is planned to synthesize nanomaterials  and  design 3D nanosensors measurement  platforms that will enable the first investigation into these processes. Specifically, research effort will focus on:  (i) Defining the fundamental materials- properties to form the 3D organization of a nanosensor array. (ii) Investigating the interface between the nanosensors and the microscale cellular assembly and manipulating the interface, and (iii) Achieving multi-site electrical interfaces both intra-cellularly and extra-cellularly and determining the development and maturation of iPS-CM.  The proposed research is the critical first step in measuring electrical activity in 3D. This novel measurement platform will potentially be transformative and will help us address broader challenges in such fields as stem cells, cardiomyocytes and neuronal cells electrical activity. The educational goal is to advance and promote teaching and research of nanosensing and nanoelectrical-biosensors at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), especially for students majoring in engineering, and natural sciences programs. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective is to use nanomaterials and nanosensing as tools in STEM education and spur grassroots innovation in bio-nanosensing. The educational approach is to (i) integrate the concepts of nanosensing into graduate and undergraduate class.

As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 8 students each year. The objective is to train veterans and non-veterans to conduct trauma-related research with veteran participants. The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 4-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions.<br/><br/>Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD. Moreover, our society would benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. This REU site broadens the participation of under-represented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. The PIs also provide an opportunity for veterans to re-integrate to an undergraduate research culture in a safe environment with appropriate supports. Moreover, this veteran participation in the design and implementation of trauma-related research with fellow veterans constitutes a novel application of ""participatory research"". Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants can learn to appreciate the value of veteran participation in trauma-related research, particularly when that research involves a veteran population."

However, how the nervous system produces behavior is not well understood, largely because most of the neural pathways underlying behavior are complicated.  In this research project, vocal behavior of African clawed frogs is used as a model because their vocal neural pathways are simple and straight forward, and the pathways in action can be studied using techniques that were previously developed in the PI's laboratory.  In addition to their simplicity and accessibility, the frog vocal pathways provide a unique opportunity to study how female and male brains function differently; male and female frogs produce sex-specific vocalizations during the breeding season, and the injection of male-specific hormones into an adult female results in male-like vocalizations within thirteen weeks.  In this study, the focus is placed on one group of cells that are known to play a critical role in the operation of the pathways.  A variety of experimental techniques will be used to understand where these neurons are, how these neurons function, and how they respond to male-specific hormones.  The results of the study will not only provide us with the understanding of how behaviors are generated in the two sexes, but also provide us with an insight into how human brains generates rhythmic activity such as alpha and gamma waves, many of which are known to underlie cognitive processes, and known to be disrupted in diseased states.  <br/><br/>A fundamentally important question in neuroscience is how neural networks function to generate motor programs that underlie behavior.  Although analyses of a complete neural network that generates behavior is a formidable task, the relative simplicity of the Xenopus vocal network combined with the development of the fictive preparation (a ""singing brain in a dish"" preparation) and the application of behavioral, electrophysiological, anatomical, and newly developed optogenetic techniques allows detailed investigation of the dynamic organization of brain in action.  The results of the proposed study will not only provide insight into the structure, function, and plasticity of the rhythm-generating neural network at the cellular levels, but also allow us to understand the logic of how a feedback loop should be engineered into a network to generate stable rhythms.  Rhythmic neuronal activity is not limited to motor systems, but is prevalent across the entire CNS and is considered to underlie important functions such as perception and cognition.  Thus, understanding the biophysical principles that govern rhythm generation using a simple neural network has a potential to elucidate mechanisms underlying neuronal oscillations in general.  On a technical level, successful application of optogenetic tools to the Xenopus fictive preparation in vitro fills an important gap between research efforts conducted on genetic vs non-genetic model organisms.  There are many non-genetic model organisms that present unique questions.  The ability to express genetically encoded tools in non-model organisms represents a revolutionary change in the field of comparative neuroscience."

Concentrations of DO have been shown to be steadily decreasing in deeper ocean waters and the resulting areas of critically low DO content, known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), are expanding. While this phenomenon is recognized as having potentially serious impacts on biogeochemical cycles where OMZs are growing, surprisingly little research has been done to identify the mechanisms and quantify the specific processes that will affect these changes. This project will study the connection between changing DO concentrations and nutrient cycling in the interior of the ocean. The oxidation of nitrogen compounds (ammonia and nitrite in particular) is strongly influenced by DO concentrations. Because of the complex and connected nature of marine biogeochemical reactions that involve DO, each one potentially altered by concentration changes, this research is critical for a complete understanding of how ocean chemistry will change in the near future. The project will incorporate education into the research by developing materials to teach high school students about the nitrogen cycle, by developing a marine chemistry based course for undergraduates that will give them both field and computational experience, and by building on past efforts to include traditionally underrepresented groups in science. One of the graduate students funded by this project will translate lectures into Spanish and make these available on the internet for increased accessibility for minority students.<br/><br/>The world's largest oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), located in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP), is an ideal study site for research into the effects of varying dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations on nutrient cycling in the interior ocean. Throughout this OMZ, the extent of anoxia exhibits a range that allows for study of the effect of changing DO content on the rates and mechanisms that control consumption of DO and organic matter by aerobic microorganisms in a 'real world' setting. In particular, ammonia and nitrite oxidation, reactions that play a critical role in the nitrogen cycle, are likely to be significantly affected by varying DO concentration. This project will evaluate aerobic respiration, ammonia, and nitrite oxidation rates at various stations in the ETNP, examine carefully controlled incubations, and develop primers to target active microorganisms in the OMZ; all to quantify the connections between DO and these biogeochemical nutrient cycles. The research will also examine the hypothesis that more organic carbon is respired in waters with low DO and a shallow OMZ than previously thought and evaluate the possibility that nitrogen cycling in low DO regions could push OMZs to anoxia due to nitrite oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction, which could potentially accelerate DO consumption. With the expansion of OMZ's in a changing ocean, it is crucial to more fully understand the connections between these various, complex, components."

In this project, the University of Arizona South (UAS) will be collaborating with 13 high-need school districts along the Arizona-Mexico border. The total student population is 35,000 in these districts. Utilizing such innovative professional development pathways as field experiences at University of Arizona's Biosphere 2, Math Teacher's Circles, and monthly Teacher Education Seminars, the project will improve STEM education within underserved border school districts and will provide insights that may be extended to similar border and rural settings around the nation. Scholars will receive the support of university coaches to provide guidance and support. The Noyce Border Scholars project will increase the number of highly qualified STEM teachers in border schools, with an emphasis on underrepresented minority teachers, encourage more STEM professionals to enter the profession, provide targeted teacher preparation through a redesigned Intern Certification track of the UAS M.Ed. program, support new teachers throughout a two-year induction period, with high quality professional development in STEM, and contribute to the body of research on innovation in teacher education.<br/><br/>With its focus on culturally relevant professional development in support of culturally relevant teaching, the project will further develop the field of context-specific teacher education for STEM teachers in rural and border schools, address the critical shortage of STEM teachers in border area schools, advance knowledge through context-specific teacher education, and help to build the infrastructure of border schools to recruit and retain ethnically diverse and culturally competent STEM teachers. The project's emphasis on integrating research and education, backed with culturally competent pedagogy, will provide communities with teachers armed with the skills to impart the appreciation of STEM to their students. Societal benefits will include advancing student potential in a region characterized by poverty, a prevalence of English learners, and low educational achievement levels. Findings will be disseminated in publications and presentations reaching STEM educators in other underserved regions, and curricula and techniques will be shared with other professionals in teacher education programs, especially those that serve border and rural school districts. The project's intellectual merits will build on the successful teacher preparation program of the University of Arizona South's Transition to Teaching program. Throughout the life of the project, Noyce Border Scholars will report increased STEM content knowledge, increased knowledge and skills related to teaching in a multicultural environment, and increased STEM teaching self-efficacy, thereby improving the teaching environment in the culturally varied, economically challenged areas served by partner school districts."

Firefighters, community planners, and local residents all depend on accurate predictions of the spread of wildland fires for operational firefighting, evacuations, community design, and prescribed fire design. It is well known in the wildland fire community that increasing winds or slope will increase the rate of spread of a wildfire; however, the physical mechanisms by which a fire spreads are not well known. This uncertainty is, in part, why no models can accurately predict the critical thresholds for fire spread. Important thresholds include when a fire will extinguish or transition from surface fire spread to crowning through the tree-tops. This research project will utilize laboratory experiments to develop quantitative models to describe the physics of fire spread. Once these improved models for fire spread are developed, they can be used for predicting fire suppression, evacuations, and fire weather alerts. Solving the wildfire problem will take more than just advanced research. A workforce trained to understand both the practical and scientific fire problems in wildland fire will also be necessary. In conjunction with this project, two outreach programs will be implemented. First, an educational program for middle and high school girls will use fire science as a unique avenue to introduce underrepresented students to STEM careers. Second, researchers will work with the first responders - wildland firefighters, to inform them of hazards and safety techniques. <br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to understand the previously-unexplored role of intermittent heating that is driven by reacting-flow instabilities on wildland fire spread, in the hope that this knowledge may lead to a testable, physical theory of wildland fire spread. Current models either rely on empirical results or assume that radiation is the dominant heat transport mechanism. Recent observations by the PI and his collaborators have instead shown that intermittent heating from flames is, in many regimes, an equally important process driving flame spread and cannot be neglected. Buoyant instabilities originating in the reacting flow of wildland fires eject flames far ahead into unignited fuel, driving the spread. During the most devastating wildfires, these regimes tend to be dominant and, hence, current flame spread models fail. This study of intermittent fuel heating will contribute to these important numerical tools which will address critical failures during extreme fire conditions. Experimental work will include the use of stationary burners under forced-flow, inclined, and combined configurations. In addition, a pulsed-gas burner will be used to couple the effects of flame instabilities on fine fuel ignition which drive flame spread. Theoretical work will include developing theoretical models and scaling relationships for the formation of coherent structures in the flow and their effects on intermittent heating of fine fuels. The development of new models and collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service will propel these results directly into practice and couple the disparate fields of wildland fire and combustion science."

While common understandings of colonial impacts on indigenous peoples in the Americas have focused on depopulation and loss of cultural traditions, archaeological research is uniquely positioned to offer insight into the active strategies Native Americans employed to navigate the changes of the colonial period. Archaeological data can be used to track developments that are not well represented in historical documents, such as long-term adjustments to indigenous social organization, mobility, and economic connections. By examining how Native Americans drew upon existing social and cultural patterns to negotiate increasingly complex interactions with Euro-American colonists, scholars can better understand the autonomy exercised by indigenous societies despite the challenges they faced in the colonial era. Because contemporary notions of Native American sovereignty largely hinge on the events of the colonial period, this research is directly relevant to broader debates about indigenous culture change and the popular and governmental recognition of Native American groups today. It is also relevant to understanding the nature of multi-ethnic interactions which occur in many regions of the contemporary world and how ethnic groups negotiate with and are incorporated into nation states.<br/>The project expands the focus of archaeological studies of colonialism beyond European settlements and first contact situations to investigate how native people living outside of direct colonial control selectively engaged with different colonial institutions over time. Drs. Panich and Schneider, along with their research team, will examine these issues on the Pacific Coast of central California, where local Coast Miwok groups lived at the crossroads of the Spanish, Russian, Mexican, and American frontiers. The research is designed to evaluate Native Americans' different strategies for maintaining autonomy at four politically and economically important village sites that were occupied from prehistoric times through the colonial period. Data will be drawn from targeted archaeological investigations, state-of-the-art laboratory analysis of archaeological materials collected during the mid-twentieth century, a GIS database of regional archaeological sites, and a systematic review of relevant ethnographic and historical literature. Working in conjunction with the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, the researchers will provide training in archaeological methods to tribal scholars as well as university students.

Fast, robust and scalable algorithms that are simultaneously cognizant of all three dimensions (data, interconnection, and computing platform) are acutely needed for the purpose of analyzing massive datasets and extracting knowledge and insight from the data. This project (named FASCADA, Fast and Scalable Combinatorial Algorithms for Data Analysis) will explore the interplay between graph and matrix algorithms in order to develop methods for data analytics that perform at scale on contemporary platforms, with a primary focus on data that are expressed in terms of networks. Algorithmic research progress to be made in the project will be realized in software implementations, will be integrated with existing software tools when applicable, and will be made available to the wider community as open-source software. As part of the project's integrated education and outreach component, two new innovative courses, an undergraduate course on Data Science and a graduate course on Network Science, will be developed and taught. The educational effort will contribute to meeting the rapidly expanding need for a trained workforce in data science in the US economy and will contribute to US competitiveness in the global market. Underrepresented minority groups in computing sciences and engineering will be recruited and mentored through an existing, effective program in the Pacific Northwest (LSAMP), and undergraduate students from Heritage University will be mentored through summer internships at Washington State University.<br/><br/>The specific research aims of FASCADA are organized under four intertwined areas. (1) Enabling Scalable Data Analytics: devise novel ""problem-partitioning"" methods that are useful for solving, at scale, optimization problems underlying a large class of machine learning algorithms. (2) Network Analysis: develop fast algorithms for discovering and analyzing dense subgraphs in real-world networks arising from diverse domains. (3) High Performance Computing: develop effective paradigms for the parallelization of inherently sequential graph algorithms targeting many-core architectures.  (4) Algorithmic Differentiation (AD): advance AD as a technology by designing better graph-based algorithms for Hessian computation, and use AD in emerging applications, including quantifying uncertainty. A common thread that runs through all four of the areas is a focus on graph problems and their solution. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the exploration of the bidirectional interaction between graph and matrix algorithms. Results from this effort will advance fundamental knowledge at the intersection of a range of areas, including data science, computational science and engineering, computational mathematics, and high performance computing.

Data will be drawn from targeted archaeological investigations, state-of-the-art laboratory analysis of archaeological materials collected during the mid-twentieth century, a GIS database of regional archaeological sites, and a systematic review of relevant ethnographic and historical literature. Working in conjunction with the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, the researchers will provide training in archaeological methods to tribal scholars as well as university students. The investigators will work closely with the tribe and local landowners to use the results of the project to develop culturally sensitive stewardship guidelines and public interpretive materials."

By leveraging the principal investigator's (PI's) expertise in electrochemistry, membrane separations, and colloidal science, this project will advance the science and engineering of water treatment processes with a clear improvement over existing best practices. This project embodies the PI's goal of ensuring safe and plentiful water resources in a rapidly changing global environment by applying innovative technological solution. <br/><br/>Electrochemical reactions have the potential to solve many of the most persistent challenges facing membrane-based water treatment processes. These challenges can be summarized as: 1) the sensitivity of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes to oxidizing chemicals, such as chlorine, which significantly complicates biofilm management and membrane cleaning operations, and, 2) membrane fouling in in ultrafiltration and membrane distillation processes. This project will address both of these problems by applying electrochemical methods. The PI will use electropolymerization to fabricate a new generation of chlorine-resistant, smooth nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, and electro-polymerize conducting polymers onto porous carbon nanotubes to form electroactive ultrafiltration and membrane distillation membrane materials that are resistant to electrocorrosion. The project is based on the central hypotheses that that electropolymerized polymeric films can maintain the chemical structures and transport properties critical to membrane separation processes while providing improved functionalities. The first major objective of the project is to fabricate, characterize, and test an electropolymerized material that combines the transport properties critical to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes with chlorine-resistance and a smooth surface. This objective will be pursued by developing appropriate electrically conducting substrates, identifying potential monomers, testing/characterizing the electropolymerized materials, and modeling the resulting polymeric material. The second major objective is to form electrically conducting ultrafiltration and membrane distillation membrane materials that can be used as anodes at high electrical potentials without suffering from electro-corrosion, and that can participate in electrooxidation reactions. This objective will be pursued by electropolymerizing conducting polymers onto carbon nanotubes substrates, characterizing the electrochemical, chemical and physical properties of the composite material, and describing the transport properties of the membrane materials. Finally, all the membranes will be tested for their anti-fouling properties using model organic and inorganic foulants. Electropolymerized chlorine-resistant nanofiltration and reverse osmosis materials and electro-corrosion resistant conducting membranes represent an advancement in membrane-based water treatment processes. They have potential applications in wastewater reuse, seawater desalination, and groundwater treatment. The project will develop fundamental understanding of the electrochemical reactions taking place during the fabrication of the new reverse osmosis material and during the electrochemical reduction of nitrate. The research plan directly addresses the NSF Environmental Engineering Program's emphasis on enhancing the availability of high quality water supplies. The focus of the education plan is to provide disabled military veterans with internships in order to attract/maintain them in STEM fields  Additionally, the PI works at a Hispanic-serving institution and collaborates with a community college that serves Hispanics."

The goal of this research is the development of catalytic chemical reactions using the earth-abundant and inexpensive copper (Cu) as the catalyst. The target reactions provide powerful tools for the syntheses of complex and diversified molecules, such as drugs and organic materials, by limiting the required number of reaction steps and thus minimizing the time for process development. The outcomes of this investigation have a positive impact on society by developing novel protocols for organic chemical transformations based on earth-abundant, sustainable catalysts. Professor Giri has established a partnership with the UNM College Enrichment and Outreach Program to involve undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented groups.  He has established an outreach program with the South Valley Academy, a public charter school in Benalillo County, New Mexico. <br/><br/>Integration of cross-coupling into the tandem and multi-component (MC) reaction manifolds has the potential to create new synthetic methodologies. The research focuses on developing Cu compounds as sustainable catalysts for the proposed transformations. As part of the education component, the investigator has developed a course for senior undergraduates and graduate students focused on organometallic chemistry that emphasizes the use of sustainable transition metals in the development of new chemical transformations. In this project, various organometallic reagents, amines, alcohols, and carbonyl compounds are employed as sources of nucleophiles to add across carbon-carbon multiple bonds (olefins, alkynes, and allenes) and subsequently cross-couple with organohalides in a tandem fashion. The ability of copper to avoid beta-hydride eliminations is expected to facilitate the tandem and MC cross-couplings of electrophiles and nucleophiles that contain beta-hydrogens. Hybrid bidentate ligands containing both pi-acceptor and sigma-donor groups are employed to generate stable and active Cu in the +1 oxidation state required to conduct the proposed transformations. The ligands are tuned sterically and electronically to render Cu reactive towards the less reactive aryl halides. Alternatively, organic electron donor-based organic catalysts, which react with organohalides via a single electron transfer process, provide an alternative strategy for coupling reactions with less reactive aryl halides. A long-term goal of the project is to perform the reactions enantioselectively using chiral, non-racemic ligands to prepare complex molecules with multiple chiral centers.The research is performed at the interface of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, which provides an opportunity for training future scientists from high school to graduate school. This award also supports the outreach efforts of the Giri group to train high school and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences."

As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 8 students each year. The objective is to train veterans and non-veterans to conduct trauma-related research with veteran participants. The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 4-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions.<br/><br/>Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD. Moreover, our society would benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. This REU site broadens the participation of under-represented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. The PIs also provide an opportunity for veterans to re-integrate to an undergraduate research culture in a safe environment with appropriate supports. Moreover, this veteran participation in the design and implementation of trauma-related research with fellow veterans constitutes a novel application of ""participatory research"". Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants can learn to appreciate the value of veteran participation in trauma-related research, particularly when that research involves a veteran population."

Governments and non-government agencies that look to provide aid to address this malnutrition need effective ways to measure which vitamin or mineral deficiencies affect different regions, and which groups of people are most in need of their aid. Currently, measurement of nutrient levels in blood samples is prohibitively expensive for these organizations. In this project, the I-Corps team will confirm the commercial viability of a novel diagnostic test that can measure certain vitamin or mineral levels in human blood, and that can be economically deployed on site in environments with little access to scientific equipment or electricity. The proposed system will provide healthcare workers with information needed to improve and maintain human health.<br/><br/>This project will involve customer discovery, market analysis, and the development of a business model related to the proposed innovation. This team intends to interview at least 100 potential customers to better assess the desired characteristics and capabilities of our assay system, and to better define customer segments as well as the characteristics of the desired customer. The team will also strive to better define the market and our competitive advantages, including the unique value proposition. Based on the findings of this research, the team may elect to modify the characteristics of our assay system, to better define target markets, and perhaps more accurately define the proposed project's value proposition and its competitive advantages. The proposed venture, should it be viable, would have a significant impact on nutritional epidemiology work done globally. The proposed technology offers the potential for an order of magnitude reduction in cost, as well as on-site measurement of nutrient levels. Results will be available within a few hours or overnight, compared to the current state of the art which entails refrigerated shipping of samples with a week or more between sampling and receipt of results. The lower cost of this approach places it squarely within the reach of organizations performing nutritional epidemiology work, meaning that populations can be sampled on a meaningful enough scale to allow informed decisions on nutritional interventions. Moreover, this team expects this product to open a new market for nutritional monitoring after interventions; since current measurement costs are so high, tracking the success of a nutritional intervention is not economically viable. The proposed approach could enable tracking that would then allow for scientists and doctors to better understand which of their interventions are working and where, ultimately saving both lives and dollars in the developing world and beyond."

These watersheds represent a wide range of terrain, land cover, land use, and climate conditions, and they include varying degrees of human disturbance.  With such an expansive dataset, the project will provide insight as to how and why watersheds respond differently (or not at all) to ENSO.  The study will improve scientific knowledge and understanding about climate impacts on the terrestrial water cycle, not only for multi-year climate oscillations but also for long-term climate change, which are both critical for managing water supplies, planning civil infrastructure, and preparing for natural disasters.  The project will also provide geospatially-oriented tools to improve hydrology education for K12 and university students while providing postdoctoral training for an emerging hydrologist.<br/><br/>Preliminary analyses suggest that watersheds filter ENSO signals differently, even after accounting for variations in precipitation responses to ENSO across the country. Spatial characteristics associated with internal watershed organization are hypothesized to explain a significant amount of the observed variability in watershed responses to ENSO.  This hypothesis is rooted in geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) theory, which links the spatial organization of watersheds to their hydrologic responses. This project builds on the GIUH framework and applies it to long-term climate phenomena such as ENSO, using statistical learning methods along with hydrological modeling to test hypotheses. Overall, the work seeks to improve scientific knowledge and understanding about climate impacts on the terrestrial water cycle by bridging the gap between mechanistic, watershed-scale studies of hydrological responses and large-scale studies of climate-streamflow interactions that are predominantly statistical in nature. This work acknowledges the so-called ""big data"" nature of many geospatial research problems in the hydrologic sciences and brings statistical learning methods, currently under-utilized in the field, to bear on large, publicly available datasets."

To provide robust and affordable polymer materials, one thrust in polymer chemistry is to develop efficient and inexpensive polymerization method that can prepare well-defined polymers with precisely controlled structures, compositions and dimensions. These polymers could be translated into functional materials for specific applications, such as self-healing materials, nanocomposites, coatings, lubricants, microelectronics and nanomedicines. In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Haifeng Gao at the University of Notre Dame develops a facile one-pot one-batch polymerization method that can prepare functional polymers with highly branched structures and very narrow size distribution.  The research program is integrated with an education plan to develop undergraduate-level polymer courses and outreach activities (which including an annual Notre Dame Soft Materials Symposium and Science Fair) to stimulate academic-industrial collaboration and to engage the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>This research seeks to develop a conceptually new polymerization method that applies the copper (Cu)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) polymerization of ABm (m is greater than or equal to 2) monomers to form polytriazole-based hyperbranched polymers in one pot.  An important feature of this method is the confinement of the Cu catalyst within each hyperbranched polymer molecule, resulting in a chain-growth polymerization mechanism with a linear increase of polymer molecular weight and decreased polydispersity with reaction conversion.  In addition, the dangling B group in the linear unit is expected to demonstrate higher reactivity than those in the terminal unit, resulting in a fast conversion of linear unit to dendritic unit in hyperbranched polymers and ultimately achieving a high degree of branching.  The research activities provide hands-on laboratory training to the graduate and undergraduate students at Notre Dame in organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, and various characterization techniques. The students are developing presentation skills targeting both expert and non-expert audiences. The broader education and outreach impacts are magnified by: 1) improving the impact of current and new polymer chemistry topics in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, 2) lecturing at local high schools to raise the public awareness of advanced polymer materials and nanotechnologies, and 3) organizing an annual Notre Dame Polymer Materials Symposium to stimulate academic-industrial collaborations and engaging the participation of high school students and teachers in a local science fair."

It is the protein coronae rather than the original NPs that are ""seen"" by cells and tissues and subsequently determine the biological and/or pathological functions of these released NPs. The objective of this proposal is to develop and apply state-of-the-art computer simulation methods to understand the fundamental aspects of the corona formation and to determine the physical and chemical properties of NPs that dictate the protein absorption. The obtained knowledge will help guide the design of novel NPs that promotes the intended biological functions and prevents the unintended pathological responses, enabling the ""safe-by-design"" to the broad scientific and engineering community for modeling and predicting corona formation and rapid risk assessment of NP exposures. <br/><br/>In this CAREER proposal, the PI proposes to apply the multiscale discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) methodology to characterize the structure and dynamics of NP-protein corona and to identify the physicochemical determinants of the NP-protein interactions. The objective of this research will be accomplished by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop NP models and their interactions with biomolecules for DMD simulations; 2) Uncover the physicochemical determinants of NP-protein binding; 3) Characterize the structure and dynamics of protein aggregation in the corona; and 4) Extend the research and education in classroom and laboratory more broadly to other education and scientific research community. The developed and validated computational methodology will be shared with the broad scientific research communities. The proposed research projects will uncover the structural and dynamic properties of NP-protein corona at the molecular and atomic level and determine the physicochemical determinants of the molecular complex formation. The obtained results from the proposed mechanistic studies will be pivotal in designing more efficient and safe NPs with optimal properties to promote intended biological functions and minimize the pathological implications of NP exposure. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this proposal include the sustainable development of nanotechnology and improves applications of nanomedicine. Funding of this research will also support students training at the interfaces of physics, material science, biology, and environmental science and engineering, update physics curriculum to reflect the current trend in science, and increase the diversity of physics education and research. The proposed research will develop and validate critical predictive tools to effectively and efficiently model the nano-bio interface, which can be used for engineering NPs with novel biological functions as well as for NP risk assessment.

The proposed research will close this gap using nearly three decades of data collected from hundreds of populations of a plant (white campion) and an associated disease (anther smut). With these data, we will be able to follow the genetics of local populations as they are born, exchange migrants, and possibly go extinct. These observations are important for understanding how genetics affects extinction and colonization success. More broadly, understanding the dynamics of interconnected populations is fundamental to predicting how disease outbreaks can occur from local patches, how invasive species spread, or how the genetics of species can be altered when they are rare or occur in fragmented habitats. <br/><br/>The major objective of the proposed research is to follow the process of extinction and colonization in interconnected populations and study how these processes create and destroy genetic diversity. This proposal builds on a now 28-year study of the numerical dynamics of Silene latifolia (white campion) and its pathogen Microbotryum violaceum (anther smut). This project uses a long-term population genetic approach to characterize numerous colonization and extinction events and to follow populations through time. Methods used will include long-term monitoring (eventually more than over 800 populations for >30 yrs) and continued genetic sampling (eventually >15yrs). High throughput genomic studies of Silene populations will provide unprecedented resolution of changes in genetic divergence, the parentage of newly established populations, gene flow during population expansion or contraction, the genetic consequences of seed banks and the importance of inbreeding and genetic rescue for population persistence. Also, broad demographic shifts have occurred during the course of this study, opening up the potential to explore the population genetics of non-equilibrium systems of both the host plant and the disease. The Silene/Microbotryum system has become a model for numerous labs, and this research will provide a publicly available long-term data set of demographic and genomic data, living collections, and DNA samples. This study will provide scientific training in timely important fields of ecology, genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology."

Motivated by their potential applications in biological systems, such as therapeutics, Prof. Alabi of Cornell University develops novel approaches to the synthesis of sequence-defined polymers and investigates how the composition and sequence affect their properties.  Educational and outreach activities are integrated throughout the duration of this research project through a common theme that is focused promoting peer-to-peer learning and empowering young aspiring scientists to take up leadership positions in communicating science ideas to the broader public. Based on the Dr. Alabi's experience creating a comprehensive 3-day workshop for underrepresented high school students, this project develops an ""Ambassador Program"" that involves teaching and supporting high school students how to disseminate ideas in science and engineering to their peers and the broader public.<br/><br/>Building on the method invented by the Alabi group for the synthesis of sequence-defined linear oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs) that undergo pre-programmed self-assembly into desired 3D architectures, this research project aims to further develop novel, efficient methods for the synthesis of sequence-defined multicyclic structures.  Towards this challenging goal, this research investigates how molecular composition and sequence influence chain dynamics, the efficiency of macrocyclization, and ultimately the properties of the macromolecular assemblies.  In addition to providing research training to graduate and undergraduate students, an ""Ambassador Program"" is being developed to train and equip high school students with the leadership and communication skills required to disseminate topics in science and engineering to their peers and the broader public."

Projects make an effective use the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as a resource tool, and provide glimpses into future.  The research impact of the OEIS across disciplines continues to grow. Applications of the  to the life sciences, physical sciences, and earth sciences abound. The OEIS has also impacted research in scientific and engineering fields beyond the mathematical sciences. There are currently more than 3,000 papers and books in many areas of mathematics, computer science, and many other branches of science that reference and/or acknowledge the OEIS. The large number of citations and links to OEIS attests to its impact on advancing many areas of active research and its appeal to a broad multidisciplinary community. <br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this research concentrates on the important role sequences play in mathematics, as well as their contributions to other fields. The program will contribute to the OEIS knowledge base through projects that are influenced by recent developments and tackle challenges of mathematical and scientific discovery inspired by integer sequences. These challenges include experimentation by developing computational algorithms and meta-algorithms through the use of computers. The methodologies applied to these challenges have come to be loosely defined as ""rigorous experimental mathematics"" and have proven effective in developing conjectures in areas that include number theory, algorithmic and enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, and many other mathematical fields. Our program aims to prepare students to become the next generation of mathematical scientists efficient in researching sequences and their applications through the OEIS database, the most successful of whom will have the capacity to look to the OEIS for inspiration. We will nurture this capacity by highlighting the contributions to the mathematical sciences of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. A particular emphasis of our program will be to discuss the important role the OEIS has played in developing conjectures in areas that include number theory, algorithmic and enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, and many other mathematical and scientific fields, as well as the tools necessary for identifying such conjectures."

It contains components that are both practical (identifying pathways that students actually take in a particular curriculum) and theoretical (understanding how self-regulated learning and decision making affect real-life choices). The research will broadly impact the way that policy decisions are made in engineering programs across the US. This project is unique in that it packages the research findings not only for other researchers, but for direct student use. An online Academic Dashboard will be developed to help students leverage the research results and put them in the driver's seat of their education. It is expected that these skills will be especially beneficial for students from low-performing high schools who have never been challenged academically before. The end result will be students who self-regulate their decision making process to choose paths that are most likely to lead to success and make adaptive daily choices that help them achieve their goals. Ultimately the work will lead to a more diverse group of engineering graduates by expanding the opportunities for students who have difficulty navigating the engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>This project seeks to advance understanding of academic pathways, achievement, and self-regulation in engineering. Students who persist in a major but never progress to graduation are of particular interest. Preliminary work has shown that the students who remain in college the longest without graduating are also the least likely to change majors. The project employs a multi-faceted approach to both study and assist these students who persist but do not progress through the lens of self-regulation, with particular focus on the self-regulation model of decision making and self-regulated learning. The research goals are to: 1) identify curriculum-specific patterns of achievement that eventually lead to dropout as well as corresponding alternative paths that could lead to success and 2) advance knowledge of self-regulation patterns and outcomes in engineering students. The education goals are to develop curricula and advising materials that help students learn how to effectively self-regulate their decision processes through contextual activities and story prompting."

This research aims to understand how barriers to reproduction have evolved in a long-lived conifer, Torrey Pine, one of the rarest pines in the world. With a restricted distribution to just two discrete populations, a mainland population and an island population, this research uses a particularly exciting approach to understand the evolution of reproductive barriers in a long-lived species using longitudinal monitoring of plant phenotypes and fitness characteristics within a common environment. Established in 2007, mainland, island and first-generation hybrid seedlings representing island maternal plants fertilized by mainland pollen donors were planted into a single common environment at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden. Annual monitoring of these trees suggests there is an advantage to being a hybrid in the common environment, with hybrids taller and exhibiting increased fecundity relative to parent trees. However, whether this advantage is maintained across future generations remains a question, which will provide insight into mechanisms that contribute to reproductive isolation. This research will study those factors that define a species, and will have conservation and management implications for rare, endemic species. This project will provide field and database management exposure for students at the undergraduate and graduate level. In addition, this project will bring together partners from governmental (USDA-Forest Service), non-governmental (Santa Barbara Botanic Garden) and research institutions to promote the long-term preservation of these genetic resources, which have fundamental scientific and applied conservation value, and educational impact.<br/><br/>This RAPID project will fund a collection of data and tissue from a long-term provenance trial of Torrey Pine (Pinus torreyana), a rare, endemic California conifer planted at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden in Santa Barbara, California. The objectives of the project will be to (i) collect cones for processing and planting within a containerized common garden at the Institute of Forest Genetics in Placerville, CA, (ii) collect needle tissue for long-term storage and genomics work, and (iii) assess trait and morphological data for future association analyses with genomic data. The common garden property may be listed for sale shortly, which could restrict access to the mainland, island, and F1 individuals that were established in 2007 and that are only now reproductive and producing an F2 generation. Therefore, this funding provides an opportunity to sample tissue and collect data for the development of a longer term Torrey pine project which will aim to understand the genomic and phenotypic architecture underlying the evolution of population differences in a long-lived conifer."

The typical way that such defense occurs is by resisting the pathogen or parasite, often through an immune response.  Resistance by the host is the basis for much of modern medicine, in which the immune response is enhanced or replaced by various therapies.  However, another defense is the tolerance of the parasite or pathogen without mounting any resistance, which (under certain circumstances) can be beneficial to the host, in part because tolerance does not require the host to incur the physiological cost of mounting an immune response.  Plants are well known to tolerate various pathogens, but the ability of animals to tolerate parasites has only recently been recognized.  This project documents how a colonial bird, the cliff swallow, has rapidly evolved (over 30 years) the ability to tolerate large numbers of blood-feeding parasitic bugs.  By comparing the effects of these parasites on the birds in the 1980s versus their effects today, insight into conditions that favor the development of tolerance as a parasite defense in a social animal will be gained.  The results will have wide relevance to understanding ways that animals (including humans) can potentially minimize the negative effects of parasites and the diseases sometimes associated with those parasites.<br/><br/>Parasite tolerance has been established as a key host defense in plant-parasite systems, but few empirical studies have explored the role of tolerance in animal host-parasite relationships. This research seeks to study the ecology and evolution of tolerance defense strategies against parasites in colonially nesting cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and their principal parasite, the swallow bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae: Oeciacus vicarius).  The work builds on a long-term field study and the relatively recent adoption of new nesting sites by cliff swallows where they have come into greater contact with their nest parasites.  During the 1980s, bugs exerted severe effects on cliff swallow reproductive success, but subsequent observation suggests that the birds may have evolved greater tolerance to parasitism in the intervening 30 years.  This research seeks to establish whether cliff swallows now better tolerate parasites and how the birds? anti-parasite behavior may be changing as a result.  The novelty of this work is that it is the first to examine temporal changes in tolerance within a natural population.  This research will involve undergraduate students and a postdoctoral scientist, and participation by a community college faculty member will facilitate involvement of urban minority students.  Because enhancing tolerance by the host may be more effective in fighting inflammatory and autoimmune diseases than prescribing antibiotics (a strategy that promotes resistance to parasites), this research will encourage non-scientists to think about tolerance as a treatment option."

Comparisons with other animal models will help explain the diversity of animal life on this planet. Studies will also investigate the genes that control a key migratory behavior exhibited by these mesodermal cells. This behavior is exhibited by many different cell types, including cancer cells when they undergo metastasis. Information gathered from these studies will also be used to reconstruct three-dimensional models of embryos for educational purposes. That information will be made available through public websites so that anyone with access to a 3D printer can generate physical models of various stages of development. This will allow students and teachers access to models to better appreciate complex developmental processes, and will foster interdisciplinary interactions between the fields of biology, information technology and engineering. Finally, as this research will involve undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, it will provide valuable opportunities to train future generations of scientists and teachers.<br/><br/>This project examines fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate mesoderm formation in a model spiralian, the gastropod Crepidula. In addition to the widely conserved endomesoderm, spiralians have a second novel source of mesoderm (ectomesoderm) that may be tied to the origin of larval body plans in this clade. Unlike endomesoderm, ectomesoderm undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of ectomesoderm are poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have not been constructed for either endo- or ectomesoderm in any spiralian. This project has two specific aims: I. Determine cellular mechanisms that regulate ectomesoderm formation and II. Determine molecular mechanisms that regulate development of spiralian endo- and ectomesoderm. Experiments in Aim I will determine the role of cell-cell interactions vs. cell autonomous factors in regulating ectomesoderm formation by combining lineage tracing, laser cell ablation and fluorescence time-lapse imaging. In Aim II, a combination of gene expression analyses and molecular loss-of-function assays will decipher endo- and ectomesoderm GRNs. Comparisons of these GRNs will validate hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origins of endo- and ectomesoderm. This research may uncover novel interactions between genes regulating mesoderm formation and those involved in EMT. Comparisons with previous studies in other systems will provide a better understanding of gastrulation and body plan evolution amongst the Metazoa. This research will involve undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students to provide valuable opportunities to train future scientists and teachers, and will generate valuable reagents and resources for the scientific community. Finally, imaging data will be disseminated through open-access websites to permit 3D printing of physical models of various stages of development, so anyone with access to a 3D printer can create models to appreciate the process of morphogenesis in these embryos. This aspect of the project will foster interdisciplinary interactions between the fields of biology, information technology and engineering."

The abundance of oxidants such as ozone in the atmosphere strongly influences the concentrations of pollutants and greenhouse gases, with implications for human health and welfare. Because oxidants are not preserved in geological archives, knowledge of how oxidants have varied in the past under changing climate conditions is extremely limited.  This award will measure a proxy for oxidant concentrations in a West Antarctic ice core over several major climate transitions over the past 50,000 years.  These measurements will complement similar measurements from a Greenland ice core, which showed significant changes in atmospheric oxidants over major climate transitions covering this same time period.  The addition of measurements from Antarctica will allow researchers to examine if the oxidant changes suggested by the Greenland ice core record are regional or global in scale.  Knowledge of how oxidants vary naturally with climate will better inform predictions of the composition of the future atmosphere under a warming climate.<br/><br/>This award will support measurements of the isotopic composition of nitrate in a West Antarctic ice core as a proxy for oxidant concentrations in the past atmosphere.  The nitrogen isotopes of nitrate provide information on the degree of preservation of nitrate in the ice core record, and thus aid in the interpretation of the observed variability in the observed nitrate concentrations and oxygen isotopes in ice core records.  By providing information about the spatial scale of oxidant changes over abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period, this project may also improve our understanding of mechanisms driving these abrupt events.  Insight from this project will prove valuable for forecasting the response of stratospheric circulation to climate change, which has large implications for climate feedbacks and tropospheric composition.  In addition, the information gleaned from this project on the mechanisms and feedbacks during abrupt climate change events will help determine the likelihood of such rapid events occurring in the future, which would have dramatic impacts on humankind.

The opening and closing of stomata by guard cells is mediated in large part by these channels and is sensitive to oxidation state and gases. However, the molecular pathways that connect these cellular signals to changes in K+ channel activity are not yet known. In this project, the investigators will test a novel hypothesis that oxidation state and gaseous messengers regulate K+ channel activity directly through a prosthetic group integral to the channels themselves. The hypothesis is based on the finding that gating of many CNBD family cation channels, including these plant K+ channels and several important classes of animal CNBD family channels, is regulated by similar prosthetic groups."

Examples include modern automobiles, medical devices, toys, drones, robots, smart thermostat and HVAC systems and many more. The commercial potential of these systems has been recognized with the growing buzz around the ""Internet of Things (IoT)."" As the design of CPS/IoT systems goes mainstream, from a research, hobbyist, and niche industrial activity to a mainstream, large-scale industry, the design challenges are mounting. A primary challenge is to help designers and users gain better insight into their systems: what behaviors the systems must and must not have, why they exhibit certain desired/undesired behaviors, and how to design and implement them to achieve desired behavior. This project proposes to create a software toolkit, VeriSight CPS, and investigate its capabilities to meet this challenge. VeriSight can be used to answer queries about a system at various phases of the design and operation of a system. Industrial impact of the VeriSight toolkit is anticipated in several areas, including transportation, robotics, and medical devices.<br/><br/>The technical goals of this project are to develop a software toolkit to assist in the specification, design, verification, debugging,optimization, and maintenance of cyber-physical systems, and to investigate its effectiveness in a focused set of applications of high impact. The underlying theory is a novel blend of formal methods for design automation and machine learning. Unlike mainstream machine learning and data analytics techniques, VeriSight CPS involves the use of verification technology to analyze models and to answer queries. The envisioned contributions of the project include a general software architecture for VeriSight CPS applicable to multiple application domains, the investigation of various user interaction models, and an exploration of industrial applications in key CPS domains including transportation, medical devices, and robotics. A key part of this Innovation Corps (I-Corps) project will be to interview potential customers, e.g., those from the categories listed above, and determine which options will be the most fruitful."

These basic research efforts are integrated with a series of educational activities including the training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in materials research, the creation of accessible, adaptable, and inexpensive model kits of porous materials to support multiple outreach activities and to convey a basic understanding of materials chemistry to audiences of different ages and knowledge levels, and the establishment of a Chemistry Ambassador program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to improve awareness of and public appreciation for the role of materials chemistry in everyday lives.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The proposed research addresses critical knowledge gaps for establishing Cz-POFs as a new generation of photoactive materials for solar-energy harvesting, conversion, and utilization. The research team have demonstrated that, compared to their linear counterparts, prototypic Cz-POFs exhibit large surface area, enhanced mesoporosity, and high stability, which, along with strong reductive ability and recyclability, make them well suited for many optoelectronic applications. The specific aims of this research are centered on developing synthetic approaches (1) to further increase the oxidative ability of Cz-POFs through theory-guided chemical modification, (2) to develop donor-acceptor Cz-POFs with enhanced photoredox properties by adjusting intramolecular D-A interactions, and (3) to enhance photoredox catalytic activities of Cz-POFs. This research provides a better understanding of synthetic factors that control the electronic and optical properties, photoinduced energy and electron transfer, and photoredox catalytic activities associated with Cz-POFs and other pi-conjugated polymer networks in general. This research also contributes to the use of POFs for photochemical production of clean organic fuels from carbon dioxide as well as solar water splitting. Further, the building of a comprehensive online database Porous Organic Framework Resource facilitates interdisciplinary research on porous materials."

While these interactions are poorly understood, they're extremely important in predicting and controlling future outbreaks. The largest recorded marine epidemic ever recorded is currently ongoing in intertidal ecosystems along the west coast of North America. Sea star wasting disease (SSWD) is effecting sea star populations from South Eastern Alaska to Baja California, Mexico and local extinctions are a serious concern. Large-scale epidemics such as these are expected to become more common as the global environment and species' population distributions change. This current disease event provides a unique opportunity to better understand how hosts, the hosts' microbiome, and the disease causing pathogen change throughout an epidemic.  The research proposed here will lead to a deeper understanding of these disease events from an evolutionary and ecological perspective by characterizing changes in host and pathogen due to natural selection following epidemics.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the impact of the microbiome and virome on host disease status and progression at the individual, population, and community levels. The work will contribute to the understanding of an organism as a sum of its inhabitants and will dissect the role of the microbial community in physiological and evolutionary responses to disease. Disease may often be due to a disruption in the balance of an organisms' complex community of microorganisms. Thus, the evolution of disease is not the coevolution of two players (host and pathogen), but rather the coevolution of all members of the host's community. The ongoing Sea Star Wasting Disease event provides a unique opportunity to investigate how this evolution plays out in a widespread epidemic. Specifically, the proposed research aims to (1) identify the targets of natural selection in host and virus populations and (2) investigate molecular mechanisms in the host, virus, and microbiome that underline resistance in hosts and virulence in virus in order to identify the tipping point between asymptomatic and symptomatic hosts. This will be accomplished using a novel sequencing technique that simultaneously collects sequence data from the transcripts of the eukaryotic host, bacterial community, and viral community. This approach allows for identification of the major players in the interaction as well as their functional roles. The understanding of this complicated coevolution will impact the fields of disease ecology and evolution as well as affect the way wildlife and human diseases are understood and, hopefully, prevented or controlled."

The project will provide new information and insights to address the degree to which alpine tropical glaciers are especially sensitive to changing climatic and other environmental conditions.  The study region is one for which previous evidence seemed to indicate that alpine glaciers persisted during the middle of the Holocene Epoch, a period when evidence indicates that temperatures were as warm as or warmer than the present time period.  The project helps to assess the sensitivity of these glaciers to warming temperatures in order to better ascertain both the timing and magnitude of past glacier fluctuations.  By reconstructing past glacier extents in tropical regions like this, this project will improve basic understanding about the factors and dynamics that affect tropical glaciers as well as their sensitivity to a changing environment.  The project also will provide information that will yield more accurate predictions of future glacier mass loss, project findings will facilitate planning and development activities in tropical regions, where glaciers provide crucial freshwater resources and ongoing glacier recession will impact directly the livelihoods and wellbeing of communities.  The project will provide additional education and training benefits by engaging undergraduate students in some facets of the project and through presentations based on the project in elementary and secondary school classrooms in Vermont and New Hampshire.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The ongoing retreat of tropical glaciers has been highlighted as one manifestation of contemporary change in environmental conditions around the Earth, but the sensitivity of these glaciers to projected future climate conditions is uncertain.  Through this dissertation research project, the doctoral student will improve the understanding of tropical glacier response to warmer temperatures by determining the extents of glaciers in tropical eastern Africa over a period roughly 8,000 to 4,000 years ago, when the region was as warm as or warmer than at present.  The student will use detailed geomorphic mapping and surface exposure dating of glacial deposits in the Rwenzori Mountains to determine glacier extents during the current interglacial period known as the Holocene Epoch, which extends from about 11,600 years ago to the present.  She will employ a surface-exposure dating method that relies on measurements of the cosmogenic nuclide beryllium-10, which is produced in rock surfaces over time due to the influx of cosmic rays.  The project will be the first study to develop a beryllium-10-based chronology of Holocene glacier extents in tropical eastern Africa.  The student will compare the Rwenzori glacier chronology with records of temperature, precipitation, and glacier extents from other locations in tropical East Africa in order to assess the regional climate conditions and patterns of glacier fluctuations.  These results will be compared with Holocene glacier extents in tropical South America.  Determining whether glaciers across the global tropics fluctuated synchronously or asynchronously during the Holocene Epoch will provides information for evaluating the dynamics associated with changing global climatic conditions.  Project results will advance efforts to model glaciers within future warming scenarios, thereby providing a means to test hypotheses about the possible mechanisms that transmitted climate signals across the globe during the Holocene Epoch."

The educational objective is to increase scientific literacy around atomic level vibrations/heat transfer, since heat transfer plays a fundamental role in our energy infrastructure. The educational approach is to create a new program targeted at underrepresented minority high school students that stimulates a fascination with atomic level vibrations/heat transfer via sonification of MD simulation data (e.g., the conversion of atomic vibrations into audible sounds), which will then be used to make music. The outreach program will recruit African-American and women undergraduates, high school music teachers and high school students each summer, via two outreach programs administered by the Georgia Tech center for education. The participants will build an understanding of both atomic motions and coding as they work together to create a mobile app. The students and general public users will use the mobile app to make music from the sounds generated by sonification of each element on the periodic table, which will provide a new way for students to learn chemistry. The program will facilitate long term mentoring relationships between the PI and participants, which will both strengthen and diversify the underrepresented minority STEM pipeline.<br/><br/>Heat conduction through non-electrically conductive media is dominated by the energy transferred between atoms due to their motions. In solids, these motions are vibrations, referred to as phonons, and virtually all knowledge of phonon heat conduction is understood through what is termed the phonon gas model (PGM). The PGM works well in many situations, but the idea itself breaks down in disordered materials, where one cannot rigorously define phonon velocities. Recently, the PI developed a new molecular dynamics (MD) based formalism that presents an alternative picture to the PGM, where transport is described by normal mode correlation, instead of phonon quasi-particle scattering. Most importantly, the new formalism provides a more general view of phonon transport that allows one to treat any class of materials and exploit new features that are inconceivable from the PGM perspective.<br/>Leveraging this new perspective, the proposal focuses on (1) studying semiconductor and insulator alloys to understand heat conduction through non-propagating vibrational modes. The purpose of this is to determine if it is possible to identify or engineer an alloy that has higher thermal conductivity than one of its constituent pure crystalline compounds. Such a material would be unprecedented, because the current theory suggests this is impossible, yet experimental data and predictions based on the PI?s new formalism suggest otherwise. (2) The proposal also focuses on studying semiconductor and insulator interfaces to understand the roles of different types of vibrational modes and find the most useful descriptor that can be used to identify/engineer highly conductive interfaces. The purpose of this is to determine if it is possible for an interface to have a conductance higher than the PGM limit, where one simply assumes all vibrational modes transmit 100% of their energy. Exceeding the PGM limit would be unprecedented, because the current theory says it is impossible, yet new experimental data and predictions by the PIs new formalism suggest it is. If thermal interface conductances beyond the PGM limit and alloys with thermal conductivities higher than their pure compounds can be achieved, it could have a major impact on energy applications involving heat dissipation, such as multi-junction solar cells, LEDs and power electronics."

A national test bed network is expected to attract creative ideas and talents by engaging a wide range of partners for the progression of basic research into new innovations. The test bed network will also foster innovation among faculty and students, promote regional coordination and linkages, and develop technology-based networks of researchers. A test bed network should also serve as an ""engine of innovation"" and help to extend the Nation's historical reputation for ingenuity. To successfully encourage innovation, a test bed network should make a meaningful difference in shortening the timeline of moving products into the marketplace. It should also  reduce costs of product development. This workshop's primary objective is to define key metrics that new technologies evaluated at the national test bed network should measure and report. A second workshop objective is to determine whether or not a central reporting system to share data on innovative technologies in a national test bed network is necessary and achievable. If so, the participants will set the preliminary design conditions for such a reporting system. The workshop will consist of approximately 50 professionals that can include researchers from universities, utility research programs, and national laboratories. In addition, it will also host technology providers, entrepreneurs, and water sector venture capitalists, members of WERF's LIFT program, NSF's SBIR program, and other utility managers interested in fostering innovation, engineering consultants, and federal officials from EPA, DOE, NSF, USDA, and other interested agencies. It is expected that a national test bed network devoted to recovering valuable resources from wastewater will lead to environmental, economic, and social benefits from enhanced innovation capacity. Four supported positions are set aside for early career scientists (senior doctoral students and post-doctoral research associates) and the program committee has plans to achieve appropriate representation of under-represented groups."

In order to make use of these isotopes one must know how they partition between different minerals in the rocks.  Two of the most important elements of interest to the geological community are magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe).  This group proposes to build on their previous experimental program to test and augment theoretical predictions for iron and magnesium isotope partitioning between mineral phases at high temperatures.  The project represents an uncommon integration of experimental petrology and isotope geochemistry. The investigators have trained three graduate students in recent years, two of whom are women, an underrepresented demographic in the geological sciences.<br/><br/>Iron and magnesium are targeted for this interdisciplinary study because of their importance as rock-forming elements and recent indications that these elements may be more mobile in Earth's mantle than previously thought.  Indeed, there has been an explosion of studies on the distributions of these isotopes in natural samples.  The focus of this study is on Fe and Mg isotope fractionation between spinels and other phases.  Spinels are of interest because there is more than one coordination site for these cations in the spinel structure, affording tests of the principles of stable isotope partitioning.  Experiments will be performed in a piston cylinder apparatus.  The group will use the three-isotope method to establish equilibrium fractionation factors in these two isotope systems.  This method involves spiking one of the phases with an excess of the abundant isotope in order to disturb the usual state of mass-dependent fractionation among three isotopes in the experiments.  This mass fractionation relationship among the three isotopes is a necessary condition for equilibrium.  The drive towards reestablishment of that condition during the experimental run is used as a monitor for isotope exchange in the experiments.  The team will investigate equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation between Mg(Al,Cr)2O4 spinels and forsterite olivine and equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation between almandine garnet and magnetite (an inverse spinel).  Results of the latter experiments can be combined with previous experiments to arrive at temperature-dependent garnet-olivine iron isotope fractionation factors.  Both systems are pivotal in the interpretation of natural Mg and Fe isotope data."

Traditionally, these cells have been thought to be inert unless activated by a pathological event. Recently, it has been discovered that microglia are in fact very active, even in the absence of pathology, and that they can actively participate in important functions in the healthy brain, such as the rewiring of neuronal networks during neurodevelopment and learning. How microglia can sense the activity of neurons is currently unknown, but understanding such a mechanism is critical to unraveling how microglia perform their physiological functions. The experiments proposed determine how neuronal activity affects microglial signaling and physical contacts with neurons by monitoring both neurons and microglia in the living mouse brain. The results will give a wealth of knowledge about how microglia behave in the physiological brain and also give insights into how their functions could impact neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. In the process of doing the experiments, young scientists are trained for a future in academic and non-academic science, and participate in outreach activities that teach K-5 children about the brain. Additionally, scientists from upstate New York with research programs that focus on glial biology come together to share their new results to build a new vision of how these cells act together with neurons to perform computations.<br/><br/>To understand physiological microglial function, it is necessary to study these cells with minimal perturbation in the living brain. Two-photon microscopy allows the monitoring of signaling within cells in the intact brain, and in this project the investigator images calcium signals in neurons and microglia of anesthetized and of awake mice. Neuronal calcium signaling indicates levels of neuronal activity in a dendrite-specific manner, and the behavior of microglia with respect to more and less active dendrites can be tracked. However, little is known about the function of calcium signaling in microglia. The imaging experiments provide information on whether intracellular calcium is responsible for directed movements of microglial processes and interactions with neurons in vivo. The experiments address how such activity influences microglial contacts with synapses, synapse elimination, and microglial signaling. Taken together, the studies allow for deeper understanding of how microglia and neurons interact in physiological conditions."

In the past, all Mn dissolved in seawater was thought to exist in only one chemical form: Mn(II).  Recent work in waters and sediments with little or no oxygen has shown that Mn(III) can be the dominant form of dissolved Mn and can even be present in oxygenated water if attached to specific organic molecules called ligands. This research will further investigate these discoveries, aiming to quantify the chemical and microbiological processes responsible for Mn(III) cycling under varying oxygen concentrations. The research will compare field sites in the Broadkill River wetland, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary; measuring the water column and sediments known to have strong oxygen gradients and different organic carbon sources that could change the availability and binding strength of ligands that would stabilize dissolved Mn(III). In some chemical forms, Mn tends to act like iron, so this research may have broader implications by helping marine chemists to understand more about iron cycling in similar oxygen gradients. With growing concerns over diminished oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) in the ocean, and particularly in coastal regions, understanding the reactions of Mn(III) with organic ligands across oxygen gradients could become important for understanding Mn availability to organisms. The project includes support for the participation and mentoring of one graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers, and there will be a U.S.-Canada collaboration. A variety of public outreach activities are planned with a K-12 teacher to be selected as a participant on a research cruise.<br/><br/>Mn(III) has only recently been recognized as an important redox state for Mn in seawater. Previously, it was widely accepted that all Mn that passes through a 0.2 or 0.4 m filter is dissolved Mn(II) while the retained portion is solid Mn(III, IV) oxide.  Research in the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay has shown that soluble Mn(III) can be up to 100% of the dissolved Mn in the water column.  Also, Mn(III) can exist as complexes with organic ligands in oxygenated seawater. This project will quantify and constrain the mechanisms surrounding weak and strong Mn(III) ligand transformations across vertical and horizontal oxygen gradients.  Field sites to be studied include systems with a variety of organic carbon sources and oxygen dynamics: the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, and Broadkill River wetland estuary. This research will continue to inform the fundamental shift that is taking place in our current understanding of Mn biogeochemistry in coastal systems.  The results should also be applicable to redox processes involving Fe(III) ligand transformations, since Mn and Fe tend to exhibit similar redox chemistry under similar environmental conditions."

Phosphate is an essential nutrient, but is also a major component of agricultural runoff and water pollution.  Increased photosynthesis and transport of sugars from leaves to growing organs was hypothesized to increase overall growth, but new evidence argues that this creates an imbalance in the ratio of photoassimilated carbon (the sugars produced by photosynthesis) and available phosphate, and causes stunting.  More phosphate restores growth, but also contributes to more runoff.  The implication is that efforts to improve photosynthesis and growth while simultaneously reducing phosphate requirements may be imperiled unless the interaction between carbon and phosphate is understood and uncoupled.  This proposal aims to differentiate between two possibilities.  1) The carbon/phosphate interaction is predominantly a biochemical limitation: more carbon in growing tissues triggers a need for more phosphate-containing metabolites.  2) The plant measures the carbon/phosphate balance, and excessive carbon is recognized as a phosphate deficiency even though none exists.  These will be tested through physiological, genetic, and metabolic experiments to learn if the links between carbon transport and phosphate needs can be uncoupled. This work will reveal strategies that can be used to increase productivity while reducing fertilizer needs. In addition to traditional training of students in the research laboratory, broader undergraduate participation will be achieved by incorporating some aspects of the project into the upper level Plant Physiology laboratory undergraduate course. The approximately 30 students who take the course each year will learn principles of genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. This will not only give hands-on biotechnology experience in an active-learning environment, but also will be used as an opportunity to explore the Genetically Modified Organisms 'GMO' debate with a group of undergraduates who might otherwise be unlikely to engage with this important societal issue.<br/><br/><br/>Enhanced sucrose transport from source leaves to sink organs should improve crop yields by providing more resources for growth while relieving product inhibition on photosynthesis. Over-expressing sucrose transporters (SUTs) in the phloem enhances transport but causes stunted growth originating from a perceived phosphorus (P) deficiency: P-starvation genes are up-regulated and the effect is reversed by P supplementation. P is a non-renewable essential element and a component of agricultural runoff, such that reducing P requirements while maintaining yields are also prominent challenges. One possibility is that more sucrose causes stunting by sequestering too much P in metabolic intermediates. Another possibility is that signaling between carbon (C) and P provokes preparation for  P-limitation. These will be tested through experiments that include 1) growth with phosphite as a phosphate analog to separate signaling and biochemical effects; 2) reverse and forward genetics to identify genes that modulate C:P interaction; 3) transcriptomics to capture gene-expression reprioritization during Suc-induced P-limitations; 4) metabolic analyses to capture metabolome remodeling during Suc-induced P-limitations; and 5) physiological experiments with gain and loss of function lines to learn if C:P links can be uncoupled."

Seasoned business leaders will work with renowned scientists to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into drug, food & nutrition, and personal care products.  <br/><br/>The proposed project will substantially support the development of this new technology. The core problem/opportunity this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a long time.

H2O is a key ingredient in the formation of subduction zone magmas that erupt at arc volcanoes, volcanoes that form above subducted oceanic plates. This study will use experimental petrology to understand how magmas are formed when H2O is involved in the melting process. The experiments will consist of melting rock (the Earth?s mantle) in the presence of H2O at the temperatures and pressures equivalent to those experienced at depth below the volcanic chains. Very little is known about how H2O influences the temperature and chemical compositions produced by mantle melting. By understanding water?s influence on the temperature, melt composition and chemical reactions of this magma generation process, we will gain new fundamental knowledge of where and how the Earth?s continental crust has been generated through geologic time. This new knowledge will advance basic science by providing a quantitative framework for understanding the recycling of water through the Earth over the 4.5 billion years of our planet?s history.<br/><br/><br/>This Accomplishment Based Renewal requests support for a program of experimental petrology studies that will quantify the influence of water on melting processes in subduction zones. The experiments will systematically investigate (1) H2O-undersaturated mantle melting from 1.6 to 2.8 GPa and (2) H2O-undersaturated reaction of deeper mantle melts with shallower mantle wall rock at 1.2 GPa. Very little is known about hydrous melting in the pressure range of 1.6-2.8 GPa, so the experiments will provide new information on the process of hydrous melting in this pressure range. The proposed reaction experiments between deeper mantle melt and shallower mantle wall rock will be the first hydrous reaction experiments ever performed at pressures between 0.5 and 2 GPa. These experiments will allow a quantitative understanding of the effects of reaction within the mantle wedge, a process that is widely acknowledged but one that currently lacks experimental exploration. For both sets of experiments, the goal is to assess the influence of H2O on melt composition and to use the new data to develop quantitative models for mantle melting as well as models of melt-rock reaction in the sub-arc mantle. The magmatic processes that flux H2O through the mantle and crust in subduction zones are of fundamental importance for understanding the chemical evolution of the Earth over the last 4.5 billion years. The proposed work will provide a quantitative basis for understanding how H2O has influenced the chemical composition of the Earth?s mantle and crust. The experimental data will be used to develop models for predicting temperature, H2O content and pressure of melting for natural primitive lavas, which will be shared with the geosciences community. The results of the experimental study will also allow development of better geodynamic models of flow coupling between the asthenospheric mantle and the subducting slab, as well as providing constraints on the physical process of melt transport through the mantle wedge."

Consider, for example, the benefits of being able to ""read"" the history of a single grain of sand simply by measuring its content of key chemical elements: Was it formed during an episode of mountain building or during a volcanic eruption? How far did it travel from its source? Was it associated with a potentially valuable ore deposit at the time of formation? This project will involve laboratory synthesis of selected minerals over a range of temperature and pressure conditions, followed by measurement of the amounts of elemental impurities incorporated during growth (the concentrations of aluminum and titanium in quartz, for example, depend strongly on the temperature and pressure of quartz formation).  The broader purpose of the project is to develop ""chemical tools"" for all researchers to use in deciphering events and processes of our planet's past - from mountain building to formation of ore deposits.<br/><br/>A decade of experimental research at RPI has focused on evaluating the effects of pressure (P) and temperature (T) on the solubilities of low-abundance elements in key minerals of the continental crust.  This enterprise has been called ""trace-element thermobarometry"" because each application is based on the concentration of a single, marginally compatible element in a common or otherwise strategic mineral phase (e.g., Ti in zircon).  These thermobarometers differ in fundamental ways from ""conventional"" thermobarometers based on major-element phase equilibria, and they have a key advantage: if the system is properly constrained, the concentration of a single impurity in a single mineral can be used as an indicator of its crystallization T and/or P.  To date, this effort has produced thermo(baro)meters based on the Ti content of zircon, the Ti content of quartz (""TitaniQ""), the Zr content of rutile, and the Zr content of titanite.  The value of these thermobarometers has been enhanced significantly through experimental calibration of the diffusion laws for all relevant impurities in the phases of interest, so users can assess the robustness of the thermobarometers for specific real-world applications.  Efforts to date have had significant impact in the geoscience community (as judged by literature citations), but the development of trace-element thermobarometers and the improvement of ""old"" ones is far from complete. The proposed work is aimed at providing a full toolbox of thermobarometers for crustal systems that includes cross-checks of the various P-T indicators.  Specifically, the TitaniQ calibration will be extended to lower P for application to volcanic rocks, and Ti-in-zircon will be more thoroughly assessed for P effects.  Entirely new systems and applications will also be pursued, including the development of P-T indicators based on Ti in coesite for ultra high-pressure (UHP) rocks, Al in quartz to complement TitaniQ, Si and Al in rutile, and Ti in both K-spar and in kyanite. Equilibrium studies of all new systems will be complemented by diffusion measurements of the relevant elements. Further, the pressure-volume-temperature properties of fluid inclusions in crystals from experimental run products will be used in conjunction with trace-element thermobarometers to confirm accuracy of our calibrations at relatively low P-T applications. The proposed study involves implementation of techniques specifically in experimental geochemistry, but the applications of our results extend across a substantial expanse of geoscience, including not only igneous and metamorphic petrology but also ore-deposits research, structural geology, tectonics, and sedimentology."

Most mammals enter the world in a fairly dramatic fashion. A vaginal birth is accompanied by marked hormonal changes, mechanical stimuli associated with labor and delivery, and a transition from the sterile environment of the womb to one teeming with microorganisms. The fetus makes many physiological adjustments to survive outside the womb, and labor and delivery are the most reliable predictors of the upcoming challenges. This project examines the effect of birth on brain development, using mice as a model species. The investigators will look at effects of the timing of birth (within the normal range) and mode of birth (vaginal versus cesarean birth) on measures such as cell death and brain inflammation. Birth triggers major developmental switches for the lungs, heart, and other peripheral organs, and may play a similar role in brain development. If so, results from this project could fundamentally change the way we think about the role of birth in neural development.  Both principal investigators are unusually active in education and outreach at the local, national, and international levels, and the project will involve undergraduates and graduate students. The home institution is ranked first in the nation among not-for-profit institutions in awarding bachelor's degrees to African-American and disadvantaged students, and the investigators' laboratories reflect this diversity.<br/><br/>The team of investigators will test the idea that birth alters brain development by varying the timing or mode of birth and examining effects on the patterning of neuronal cell death, and colonization of the brain by microglia. About 50% of the neurons that are initially produced are eliminated by apoptosis. The investigators recently found that cell death peaks just after birth in most forebrain regions of mice. In Aim 1, the investigators will vary the timing of parturition to test whether the association of birth with cell death is causal. Parturition also abruptly activates the peripheral immune system. The investigators hypothesize that this immune activation extends to the brain and will test that here. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are in an activated state perinatally, and increase in number soon after birth, but whether birth causes changes in microglia is unknown. The peripheral immune activation after delivery also varies by mode of birth: vaginal birth is associated with a greater increase of many immune markers compared to cesarean delivery. Interestingly, the investigators' preliminary data show that mode of birth affects cell death in several brain regions. Thus, to identify aspects of ""birth"" that influence brain development, Aim 2 will contrast effects of vaginal and cesarean delivery on cell death and neuroimmune activation.

One of the keys to simulating the earthquake cycle are friction laws that can be applied to both the fast, dynamic motion of earthquakes, as fault rocks rub and slide past one another in frictional contact, and the slow processes of stress accumulation between earthquakes that can take hundreds of years. In this collaborative work between Princeton and Penn State Universities, unusually well-controlled measurements of frictional sliding will be conducted while collecting simultaneous ultrasonic data on the sliding interfaces and sheared layers of fault gouge. The proposed work has important societal implications for seismic hazard assessment, earthquake forecasting, and an improved, fundamental understanding of earthquake nucleation.<br/><br/>Rate-and-state friction laws represent the current state-of-the-art in the laboratory and for numerical simulations of earthquake physics, including nucleation, dynamic rupture and the complete seismic cycle.  However, our understanding of friction memory effects and slip velocity dependence remains primarily empirical, which limits our ability to apply laboratory measurements to earthquake faults and/or to address the problems associated with predicting the behavior of tectonic faults from laboratory measurements.  To address these shortcomings, recent advances in ultrasonic monitoring of sliding rock surfaces and sheared granular fault gouge will provide fundamental insights into the physics and micro-mechanical origins of frictional behavior of tectonic faults. <br/>"

Bivalves build shells from calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which protect them from predators and environmental stressors and are essential for survival. Mollusks' shells, produced from precursors abundant in the seawater, have unique mechanical properties that make them superior to geological CaCO3. However, they are energetically costly to deposit and can be eroded under corrosive conditions of low salinity, high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and low pH, characteristic of estuarine waters. Recent studies show that biomineralization of marine bivalves is impaired by prolonged exposure to the moderately elevated CO2 levels (800-2000 ppm), which appears paradoxical since thriving bivalve populations are found in estuaries with a broad range of CO2 levels (400-10,000 ppm). Another recently discovered conundrum is that some mollusks with shells made of the more soluble aragonite are less affected by elevated CO2 levels than those with the shells made of less soluble calcite. These findings challenge the current paradigm in biomineralization and indicate that interactions between the environment and biological controls of biomineralization are more complex than currently recognized. To close this gap in knowledge, the investigators will determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of biomineralization in mollusks with shells made of different types of CaCO3, assess how these mechanisms are affected by seawater chemistry and identify physiological and energetic constraints on biomineralization in potentially corrosive estuarine waters. The project involves development of an interdisciplinary BioCADRE program for training of undergraduate students, training and mentorship of post-doctoral researchers, and fostering of interdisciplinary collaborations between the University of Pittsburgh and University of North Carolina at Charlotte.<br/><br/>This study focuses on the biological mechanisms of mineralization in two keystone bivalve species, Crassostrea gigas and Mercenaria mercenaria with calcitic and aragonitic shells, respectively. The PIs will test the hypotheses that hemocytes and mantle cells utilize different molecular mechanisms of mineral sequestration and transport and that species-specific differences in biomineralization mechanisms contribute to different abilities of these bivalves to build shells at low CaCO3 saturation levels. The PIs will assess how salinity and CO2 levels affect sequestration, transport and deposition of the mineral as well as expression and activity of the proteins involved in matrix formation and acid-base balance. The PIs will determine whether successful biomineralization at low CaCO3 saturation levels leads to elevated costs of basal maintenance and trade-offs between biomineralization and other energy-dependent functions. These studies will elucidate how cellular, molecular and whole-organism processes are orchestrated to support active mineral deposition in a wide range of CaCO3 saturation levels, determine what mechanisms compensate for higher mineral solubility during exposure to hypercapnia and low salinity and assess whether these mechanisms are more effective in aragonite-depositing than calcite-depositing mollusks. This project builds on previous successful collaborations between a biomineralization expert and a mollusk physiologist and has the material and intellectual resources required for its success."

The  patent- pending innovation offers a formulated, synthetic product that mimics scent cues released from traditional fish bait, while offsetting unwarranted ecological impacts of current practices. Specifically, scent cues can be released at variable rates to provide optimal results in addressing fishing methods and preferences in different conditions and regions. Given rising costs of fish due to competition with omega-3 supplements producers, as well as labor and frozen storage costs of obtaining wild bait, and vessel space needed for such bait when fishing, the new bait will save fishermen time, money, and inconvenience. Commercially, cost advantages are likely to generate significant demand in addition to the overall practical advantages. From a societal perspective, a   sustainable,   synthetic product   can   dramatically   reduce ""net fishing"" for baiting crustacean  traps. Thus, fish could  be   conserved   in the oceanic food chain, and indiscriminate killing of sea turtles, dolphins and other by- catch would be diminished through reduced net fishing practices now employed in the capture of small wild fish traditionally used for crustacean bait.<br/><br/>The objectives of this Phase II research project are: to optimize solubility kinetics of the attractant-releasing matrix; further characterize naturally occurring molecules released by traditional bait fish; and validate product performance to catch indigenous crustacean species in the United States. Field research would focus on concentrations of chemo-attractants required to optimize  manufacturing  formulation  and  direct costs. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the characterization of the chemical basis for cues emitted by piscine, avian and mammalian tissue that most intensely attract crustacean species while developing a range of matrix formulations for optimally releasing such attractants in various fishing conditions. In addition to globally urgent considerations  of  by-catch  and  wild  stock  depletion, the  industry has been struggling with bait sustainability issues. These challenges have intensified with federal and state agencies seeking court orders to regulate catch limits, resulting in reduced supply and higher prices of bait fish. These circumstances frame an ecological and commercial opportunity for this synthetic bait alternative. Reducing the need to capture wild bait fish, as well as delivering cost and logistical advantages to commercial crustacean fisheries are expected to drive rapid market penetration upon completion of product research and development in this Phase II project."

In freshwater habitats, major progress toward clearly linking biology and geomorphology to address environmental problems includes incorporating the role of the many small animals that live in streams into our understanding of erosion. This research project investigates how bottom-dwelling invertebrates in streams influence flood disturbance by regulating the stability of the riverbed. Sediment erosion is a critical variable in freshwater ecosystems because it influences freshwater biodiversity, insect and fish egg survival, changes the composition and activity of algae, and alters carbon and nutrient cycling. An understanding of sediment erosion that includes the impacts of bottom-dwelling animals will address a range of practical problems relevant to society, including informing models to predict erosion in landscapes altered by land use, predicting the impacts of floods that are being altered worldwide as a result of changes to water levels caused by climate warming and diversion for agriculture, and protecting and restoring habitat for threatened freshwater organisms such as fish. This project will provide research opportunities for one PhD student, two Master students, and four undergraduate students, develop workshops to teach concepts related to bottom-dwelling invertebrate influences on sediment erosion to high school teachers, and produce outreach videos documenting sediment erosion.<br/><br/>To investigate how animals in streams influence physical resistance to flood disturbance with consequences for aquatic benthic communities and ecosystem processes, the researchers will study common aquatic ecosystem engineers, web-spinning hydropsychid caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae). These aquatic insects build silk structures that can bind riverbed sediment together, increase the force required to move sediments, and reduce bedload flux. The researchers will quantify sediment stabilization effects by caddisfly larvae from grain to landscape scales. They will also document how changes in sediment disturbance due to caddisfly silk structures influence ecosystem productivity, nutrient cycling, and the recovery of benthic communities following floods. The researchers will use a combination of controlled laboratory experiments, caddisfly density manipulations in natural streams, field surveys, and sediment transport models to identify how caddisfly ecosystem engineering affects sediment transport regimes across landscapes. Together, the series of studies will quantify how much these abundant ecosystem engineers can regulate erosional processes in streams."

This project will develop a new imaging technology that will allow us to visualize the motion of nanometer scale particles with high resolution for long periods of time.  These studies will open a large number of opportunities in the imaging of nanoscopic materials across a range of materials areas. These include the crystallization of polymers in ultrathin films, polymer nanoparticle-composites, the diffusion of nanoparticles in gels, in situ monitoring of separations of nanoparticles and polymers, in operando monitoring of electrochemical cells for battery applications, 2D phase separation behavior, glassy and jammed nanoparticle assemblies, the dynamics of nonequilibrium systems, and in the monitoring of nanomotors, where propulsion is provided by chemical reactions. These studies will open pathways to addressing some of the most longstanding problems in materials and provide insight into controlling non-equilibrium packing of materials, including the dynamics and ageing of glassy materials, to structure/property relationships of glassy materials, and, ultimately, to the parameters that lead to rare events, like the unjamming of particles which can impact materials science but, also, area as far-reaching as geoscience, where such unjamming phenomena, as in the unjamming of tectonic plates, lead to earthquakes.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project will develop a visualization protocol, along with the design of analysis routines and a revolutionary SEM sample cell to explore the dynamics of 2D assemblies of nanospheres (NSs) and nanorods (NRs) as the areal density of the nanoparticles (NPs) increases, bringing the NPs from a low density liquid state into a jammed or glassy state; along the way, structures and structure dynamics will be monitored at unprecedented spatial resolution. Imaging with electron microscopy provides the most valuable direct information on nanoscale structure.  However, studies of typical solvated particles are limited by the high vapor pressure of the solvents which limits both spatial resolutions and the temporal duration of the studies.  We will utilize ionic liquids (ILs) as an alternate platform to monitor solvated soft material dynamics by electron microscopy eliminating the need for a liquid cell. The proposed studies will advance our knowledge by developing instrumentation, versatile sample cell, and imaging software, to tackle a long-outstanding, truly grand challenge in materials science and physics, i.e., the nature of glassy and jammed systems. Through the development of the instrumentation and experimental protocols, we will gain insight into the dynamics of jammed and glassy materials, quantify the real-space structural rearrangements arising from NP interactions, and elucidate the heterogeneous nature of dynamics in glassy materials, a topic of intense theoretical interest."

This capability has the potential to unlock new technologies, including cameras for imaging electron motion inside biomolecules, ultrafast information processors, and devices based on exotic non-equilibrium states of matter. However, these exciting developments will require major advances in our ability to understand and control non-equilibrium quantum systems. To this end, the research team is building an artificial solid in which trapped strontium atoms are used to emulate the behavior of electronic solids on ultrafast-equivalent timescales. Using this approach, the team aims to reveal hitherto invisible ultrafast processes in matter, in regimes beyond the limits of existing theories and experiments. Research activities are integrated into local science education at the high school, community college, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, with a focus on scientific professional development. As part of the project, the PI guides a multi-layered mentoring system in which graduate students and postdocs are trained to become advocates for science literacy and leaders who encourage broad participation in research. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: This project studies interactions between intense pulsed fields and solids using optically trapped ultracold strontium as a quantum emulator of ultrafast dynamics, thus probing some of the fastest processes in atomic physics using some of the slowest. As a result of this rescaling of time, the dynamics underlying ultrafast phenomena like tunnel ionization occur over milliseconds rather than attoseconds, and can be observed in extreme slow-motion. The research consists of three related efforts: (1) studies of the impulse response of interacting quantum systems; (2) exploration of exotic strong-driving Hamiltonians beyond those which are currently possible in the solid state; and (3) realization of controllable emergent non-equilibrium phases in driven lattice systems. The quantum-emulator-based approach enables clean realization and study of strong-field phenomena, provides a tool for validation and extension of existing approximate theories of ultrafast interactions, and opens the path to studying new forms of matter and new phenomena that emerge in non-equilibrium regimes beyond the reach of existing ultrafast experiments."

In light of emerging public concerns about the cost, efficacy, and dignity of mass incarceration, counties and states have developed innovative policies designed to reduce the number of individuals behind bars. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (Brown v. Plata) that California's practices of mass incarceration were unconstitutional, and that the ""cruel and unusual"" punishment of being subject to California's overcrowded prisons was particularly difficult for inmates with mental illnesses. Following this court decision, California has experimented with alternatives in criminal justice infrastructure. One such experiment has been the development of mental health courts, which are criminal courtrooms that aspire to take convicted individuals with mental illnesses out of jails and place them in community psychiatric care. Mental health courts structurally differ from other criminal courtrooms in that prosecution and defense attorneys collaborate with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and the judges to monitor offender' progress towards mental health. In this context,offenders become ""clients"" of the courtroom. They are required to follow a court-developed treatment plan, and if they deviate from that plan, the judge may return them to jail. The research supported by this award asks what these alternative legal programs might be accomplishing in addition to the promotion of  decarceration?  Are there side effects or unintended consequences? Better understanding of the practices and effects of mental health courts is critical for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of programs designed to redress mass incarceration.<br/><br/>Princeton University doctoral candidate Jessica Cooper, with the supervision of Dr. Elizabeth Davis, will conduct the research in the mental health courts of Santa Clara and San Francisco counties in California. She will carry out ethnographic observations in the two courtrooms and in the court-sponsored clinics through which offender-clients receive care. She will supplement these observational data with interviews of courtroom and clinical professionals, as well as clients, and with analyses of court records and transcripts. These data will allow her to identify and analyze the relationships that develop between clients and state representatives to investigate exactly how these relationships work to combine care and control in order to provide public health services through a system designed for criminal justice. Findings from Cooper's research also will illuminate the degree to which structural change in the criminal justice system at the local level may affect more general extra-local relationships, as well, such as the relationships between mental health court professionals, their clients, and multiple levels of government."

Research extending back as far as 26 years at a set of six study sites along the Oregon coast will be extended and the long-term data analyzed to determine how species abundances vary in space in response to climate-driven variation a) in inputs of nutrients (e.g., algae), particulate food (e.g., mussels), and larvae (e.g., mussels, sea stars, barnacles); b) in losses driven by severe storms; and c) in response to changing interactions among species (e.g., positive and negative effects such as facilitation or predation). A new focus will be on the ochre sea star, an iconic keystone predator that experienced a dramatic decline in abundance in 2014 due to a disease epidemic. Field research will determine how associated species (prey, competitors) will respond to this reduction, whether or not the sea star will rebound to previous levels, and what the consequences of recovery or failure to recover will be for the entire community. With synthesis of over 30 years of data, the final outcome will be a detailed understanding of an important ecological community, how it is likely to change, and its resilience, or ability to rebound from environmental perturbations."

Two-dimensional layered materials exhibit some of the most striking physical phenomena in modern materials research and hold promise for a wide range of future devices and technological applications from flexible electronics to energy harvesting and storage to bio-engineering. This project explores emergent electronic and excitonic surface states on layered two-dimensional crystals that arise due to the concerted many-body interactions at nanometer length scales. These investigations will advance our fundamental understanding of surface states that govern the electronic and optical properties of the next-generation nano-optoelectronic devices and the feasibility of two-dimensional nanolasers. These research activities are part of an integrated education plan to further high school, undergraduate and graduate students' nanoscience and nano-optics learning in the greater Atlanta area. The research is also integrated with outreach activities to enhance the education and training of local high school physics teachers and students as well as with community outreach plans that targets the educational experience of African immigrant students/families and African American youth in the Atlanta area.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>The research part of this CAREER award explores the electronic and excitonic surface states on van der Waals layered two-dimensional crystals using state-of-the-art far-field and nanoscale near-field spectroscopy. The goals of this research are: (i) understand the fundamental properties of surface states in two-dimensional systems, metallic and conducting surfaces states and topologically protected surface states; (ii) understand the properties of excitons (charged and neutral) at island edges and defects and elucidate the coupling mechanism between excitonic two-dimensional materials and surface plasmons, in particular the mechanism of stimulated emission in excitonic van der Waals heterostructures made by vertically stacking atomic thin materials; and (iii) expand the scope and utility of optical, infrared and terahertz scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy approaches in the field of low-dimensional physics. The results of the proposed research will forward our underlying understanding of surface states that control the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional emergent material systems and will lead to exotic many-body physics and applications in spintronics, practical quantum computers and solid-state quantum photonics."

Iron has long been viewed as an important catalyst for societal development yet few studies have effectively demonstrated evidence of changes in the scale of production or the impact that sudden access to high quality sources had on agricultural, architectural and military activities. Archaeology offers critical new insight into the way that iron was made, distributed and consumed over time as well as identifying the type of political-economic relationships between the state and local stake holders who lived around major resources. Fundamental to this investigation is how and why do major sources suddenly become a critical part of state development? New technologies and increased access are two important factors enabling control over resources that were often known but left untouched for hundreds of years. Parallel processes are witnessed today within the oil and gas industry and the expansion of China?s global resource interests across Asia and Africa.<br/>Dr. Hendrickson?s team will investigate whether intensification and control of industrial activities were responsible for vast and sudden imperial expansion in the past. The geographic focus of the project is the Phnom Dek region in central Cambodia, the largest iron ore source available to the Angkorian Khmer Empire. The research team comprising archaeologists, archaeometallurgists, paleobotanists, and geologists will record the spatial and temporal history of industrial production and the relationship between the state consumers and local producers over a period of five hundred years. Excavation and intensive survey of smelting sites will identify critical changes in production technology and corresponding shifts in the quantity and quality of iron used for tools and weapons. The impact of this industrial history will be examined on two levels. First, what type of control did the state exert over the groups responsible for producing iron? Second, is there a direct correlation between increased production and major architectural building episodes and military campaigns undertaken by the Khmer Empire? The results will provide a dynamic history of resource management and political process that will become a benchmark for understanding the successes and failures of states and their impact on manufacturing communities. In addition to providing new opportunities for education and student training this project will generate important regional databases on metallurgical technology, the archaeomagnetic intensity curve of the earth, and industrial forest management that will be generally available and have broad, immediate scientific significance."

It has historically been thought to help people buffer risks. Largely, however, past work has focused on agricultural societies, with fewer studies considering how surpluses were produced and managed under other economic systems. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. William Marquardt, Victor Thompson, and Michael Savarese will conduct research at the Mound Key and Pineland archaeological sites to investigate the role of surplus production among the Calusa of southwest Florida, who were the most powerful group in peninsular Florida in the sixteenth century A.D. The Calusa king collected tribute from a population in excess of 20,000 distributed among 50 to 60 Calusa communities extending from the northern reaches of Charlotte Harbor to the Florida Keys. However, unlike the farming people of the interior river valleys of the southeastern U.S., the Calusa relied primarily on fish and shellfish for protein, collecting wild plant foods and using only a handful of plants from home gardens. Most importantly, they did not grow maize, which formed the basis of surplus production and political complexity for many groups across the Southeast. This project focuses on surplus production and distribution in a complex fisher-gatherer-hunter society. Few archaeologists have examined surplus production among fisher-gatherer-hunters, especially those in the sub-tropics. This research will shed light on long-term sustainability of fisheries, a topic of considerable world-wide interest, and address the potential impact of over-harvesting shellfish. The project will also help train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, both undergraduate and graduate students. As part of the research, the team will teach a field school that will involve students drawn from a broad geographical region. Students will be trained in research, as well as specialized methods and traditional archaeological excavation. The research will bring students with interests in archaeology, geology, and ecology together to address a burgeoning field in geoscience: conservation paleobiology (applying the theories and analytical tools of paleontology to solving problems concerning the conservation of biodiversity). The project will also partner with the Florida Public Archaeology Network as well as the Randell Research Center to engage the public throughout the research process.<br/> <br/>Specifically, by means of coring and archaeological excavations in structures thought to be fish and shellfish storage and processing features, the team will examine how the Calusa produced and managed large-scale food surpluses presumed to be necessary to sustain their large populations. This work aims to discover how surplus production was situated within the larger histories of the Calusa, and how these practices structured interactions with Europeans. This work will serve as a comparative study against examples that focus on the links between surplus, storage, social development, and the transition to agriculture and animal husbandry. Development of comparative case studies such as this one will help disengage the concepts of surplus, storage, and social relations in terms of both individual agency and collective action."

The cells in the edible parts of corn, beans, rice, wheat, and peas undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication where the cells replicate their DNA many times. Although individual cells undergo different amounts of endoreduplication, the proportion of cells remains constant from plant to plant. When geneticists try to increase endoreduplication, they find that the response of seemingly identical cells is somewhat random: some cells respond strongly, some moderately, and some not at all. This observation raises one of the biggest questions in developmental biology: how do identical cells make different decisions? The proposed research will investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that individual plant cells make these decisions about how much to endoreduplicate utilizing small, random molecular differences. This hypothesis is surprising: biologists would normally expect randomness to be suppressed, since development is highly reproducible, always creating the same proportion of endoreduplicated cells. Instead, randomness may in fact be required to produce this regular portion of endoreduplicated cells. Testing this hypothesis will require advanced use of computers to examine individual cells over time. University students and middle school girls will simultaneously be involved in this analysis as well as being trained in computational skills.<br/><br/>Endoreduplicating cells of crop plants are buried deep within the seed coat where they are experimentally inaccessible. Endoreduplication will thus be studied in Arabidopsis thaliana sepals, whose epidermal cells are accessible for live imaging as they endoreduplicate. The transcription factor Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) drives sepal endoreduplication, and may cause it to occur randomly. Since ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells, it is unclear how ATML1 causes only a few cells to endoreduplicate. Preliminary data show that ATML1 triggers endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner: high ATML1 makes all epidermal cells endoreduplicate, low ATML1 prevents any endoreduplication, and individual sepal cells have varying levels of ATML1. The hypothesis tested here is that randomly fluctuating ATML1 causes different levels of endoreduplication in different cells; a few cells exceed ATML1's threshold, triggering endoreduplication, while other cells remain below the threshold and do not endoreduplicate. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ATML1 fluctuations initiate endoreduplication. The associated education goal will be to work with undergraduate students to analyze images generated in this aim. For Aim 2, we will determine whether ATML1 feedback loops drive endoreduplication by amplifying differences in ATML1 expression and, in an associated educational aim, students will write and publish a computational modeling glossary to better understand the newly generated models. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the molecular mechanism through which ATML1 induces endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner. We will also develop an outreach to middle school students for the analysis of images from Aim 3 in a hands-on, web-based image analysis workshop."

Springs rich in hydrogen sulfide represent some of the most extreme freshwater environments, because hydrogen sulfide halts energy production in animal cells. Nonetheless, some fish have colonized sulfide springs throughout the Americas, and it remains unknown how they can tolerate conditions so toxic that most other organisms perish. This project will compare closely related populations that live in adjacent sulfidic or nonsulfidic habitats to identify differences in genetic, biochemical, and physiological traits that underlie tolerance to this noxious chemical. It involves the identification of genetic differences between hydrogen sulfide-tolerant and susceptible populations, particularly in genes associated with pathways affected by hydrogen sulfide toxicity or detoxification. In addition, the tolerance and the susceptibility of fish populations will be measured in the presence or absence of hydrogen sulfide. This project will yield new insights into mechanisms underlying physiological tolerance to hydrogen sulfide and the workings of animals in the presence of physiochemical stressors. Given hydrogen sulfide's role in cellular processes and disease formation, this also has implications for biomedical applications. This project provides training opportunities in integrative biology for participants at all levels of higher education. It will also contribute to science education and public outreach through the generation of an exhibit at a local zoo and the involvement of high school teachers that will generate lesson plans implementing next generation science education standards for K-12 education in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Leveraging knowledge from toxicological and biomedical studies, this project addresses hypotheses about mechanisms of physiological adaptation to naturally H2S-rich environments and focuses on components of and associated with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OXPHOS) in mitochondria. These components include targets of H2S toxicity as well as enzymes involved in H2S detoxification. It is predicted that focal components are modulated or modified in sulfide spring populations, such that individuals have an increased ability to withstand elevated H2S concentrations, an increased ability to detoxify H2S enzymatically, and an ability to maintain or even increase mitochondrial energy production by using H2S a substrate to fuel metabolism. Furthermore, it is anticipated that modification of OXPHOS components has occurred repeatedly across independent lineages that have colonized sulfide springs. To test these predictions, this project focuses on an established model system (Poecilia mexicana) for the investigation of H2S adaptation and has three major empirical components: (1) Characterization of transcriptional and coding variation in candidate genes by use of high-throughput sequencing techniques and subsequent validation of effects on protein concentrations and structure. (2) Quantification of functional consequences of transcriptional and coding variation for H2S detoxification and bioenergetics both in vitro and in vivo. (3) Comparison of gene sequence and expression variation across a dozen independent population pairs from sulfidic and non-sulfidic habitats to test for convergence."

The rate of mutation is influenced by particular genes, e.g. for DNA replication and repair enzymes, which can themselves be altered by mutations. Some variants of those genes, known as mutators, increase the genomic rate of mutation. Even when mutators have no direct effect on survival and reproduction of the individual, they can experience indirect selection via genetic linkage to beneficial and deleterious mutations that occur elsewhere in the genome.  This proposal explores a novel hypothesis that population size may have an effect on indirect selection experienced by mutators. Understanding the role of population size and spatial structure in shaping the evolution of mutation rate may resolve a longstanding empirical puzzle: why mutators frequently emerge in well-mixed microbial laboratory populations, yet are only sporadically found in nature. This project has important implications for understanding both natural and directed genetic changes in basic, health, conservation, and agriculture research. For example, this research may illuminate the role of mutators during disease progression of cancer tumors. The investigators will also work directly with K-12 teachers and students to improve their understanding of genetics and scientific inquiry. <br/><br/>Building on several of their previous publications, the applicants present preliminary calculations and experimental results suggesting that large populations enrich for mutators and small populations inhibit them.

In specific aim 2 the applicants propose to experimentally test their predictions in the laboratory by competing mutator and non-mutator strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast.

Consider, for example, the benefits of being able to ""read"" the history of a single grain of sand simply by measuring its content of key chemical elements: Was it formed during an episode of mountain building or during a volcanic eruption? How far did it travel from its source? Was it associated with a potentially valuable ore deposit at the time of formation? This project will involve laboratory synthesis of selected minerals over a range of temperature and pressure conditions, followed by measurement of the amounts of elemental impurities incorporated during growth (the concentrations of aluminum and titanium in quartz, for example, depend strongly on the temperature and pressure of quartz formation).  The broader purpose of the project is to develop ""chemical tools"" for all researchers to use in deciphering events and processes of our planet's past - from mountain building to formation of ore deposits.<br/><br/>A decade of experimental research at RPI has focused on evaluating the effects of pressure (P) and temperature (T) on the solubilities of low-abundance elements in key minerals of the continental crust.  This enterprise has been called ""trace-element thermobarometry"" because each application is based on the concentration of a single, marginally compatible element in a common or otherwise strategic mineral phase (e.g., Ti in zircon).  These thermobarometers differ in fundamental ways from ""conventional"" thermobarometers based on major-element phase equilibria, and they have a key advantage: if the system is properly constrained, the concentration of a single impurity in a single mineral can be used as an indicator of its crystallization T and/or P.  To date, this effort has produced thermo(baro)meters based on the Ti content of zircon, the Ti content of quartz (""TitaniQ""), the Zr content of rutile, and the Zr content of titanite.  The value of these thermobarometers has been enhanced significantly through experimental calibration of the diffusion laws for all relevant impurities in the phases of interest, so users can assess the robustness of the thermobarometers for specific real-world applications.  Efforts to date have had significant impact in the geoscience community (as judged by literature citations), but the development of trace-element thermobarometers and the improvement of ""old"" ones is far from complete. The proposed work is aimed at providing a full toolbox of thermobarometers for crustal systems that includes cross-checks of the various P-T indicators.  Specifically, the TitaniQ calibration will be extended to lower P for application to volcanic rocks, and Ti-in-zircon will be more thoroughly assessed for P effects.  Entirely new systems and applications will also be pursued, including the development of P-T indicators based on Ti in coesite for ultra high-pressure (UHP) rocks, Al in quartz to complement TitaniQ, Si and Al in rutile, and Ti in both K-spar and in kyanite. Equilibrium studies of all new systems will be complemented by diffusion measurements of the relevant elements. Further, the pressure-volume-temperature properties of fluid inclusions in crystals from experimental run products will be used in conjunction with trace-element thermobarometers to confirm accuracy of our calibrations at relatively low P-T applications. The proposed study involves implementation of techniques specifically in experimental geochemistry, but the applications of our results extend across a substantial expanse of geoscience, including not only igneous and metamorphic petrology but also ore-deposits research, structural geology, tectonics, and sedimentology."

The project has the potential to substantially improve the security of existing channel based authentication and location distinction approaches, and accordingly impacts wireless security research due to the wide adoption of these approaches in the design of wireless systems. The project also creates a new research direction on creating artificial wireless channels to solve practical wireless security problems. All research results will be freely distributed. This research will be coupled with education and training for introducing students to wireless security research, as well as broadening security education to non-specialists."

Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.<br/><br/>The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product."

While many tropical cyclones weaken as they move out of the tropics, a subset of these systems actually intensifies, and may increase in size. A recent example is Hurricane Sandy, which affected the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern US in the fall of 2012. In recent years, there has been intensive study of how climate change would affect the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. However, only limited research has examined how climate change affects the important category of tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics. One expected result of climate change is warming air at upper levels in the tropics; prior research demonstrates that this upper warming limits the strengthening of tropical cyclones that would otherwise occur. However, tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics may escape this mitigating influence. <br/><br/>Therefore, one goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that tropical cyclones exiting the tropics will show a greater intensity increase with warming than would storms that remain in the tropics. Another goal is to determine if and how warming changes the fraction of tropical cyclones that undergo the re-intensification process mentioned above. Finally, this project will also analyze changes in the locations and seasons in which tropical cyclones form. All of these goals will be accomplished using methods that are similar to what has been done in studying how tropical cyclones that remain in the tropics respond to climate change, but with a study area that extends well outside of the tropics. Highly sophisticated computer models, of the type used in weather prediction, will be used in combination with larger-scale changes obtained from climate models. Then, comparing ""present day"" to ""future"" simulations, with all else equal, allows determination of changes in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones moving poleward into mid-latitude locations.<br/><br/>This project addresses gaps in understanding of how climate change would influence the intensity and frequency of the subset of tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics, affecting higher-latitude locations. This category of tropical cyclones is extremely important, because it is precisely these systems, as they exit the tropics, which exert the strongest influence on the major population centers in mid-latitude locations such as the US. Given their importance, it is perhaps surprising that the response of these systems to climate change has not received more research attention to date. The project will also determine if geographical and/or seasonal changes in tropical cyclone activity will change with the climate. Owing to the highly technical nature of this project, the graduate students who work on it will gain valuable skills in scientific computing, data analysis and visualization, and in science communication. Graduate research assistants working on this project will be invited to assist in supervising undergraduate researchers, thereby gaining experience in leadership and mentoring."

After certain iron and iron-cobalt complexes absorb visible light, they undergo a rapid rearrangement (spin flip) and become trapped in a long-lived state that may be useful for practical applications. The experimental technique used in this project is tabletop extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy.  Two workshops designed to foster deep and sustained undergraduate engagement in spectroscopy research are established in association with the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy (ISMS) at UIUC. A weeklong ""Spectroscopy in the Snow"" intensive winter course gives sophomores the foundational knowledge required for physical chemistry research and allows them to begin high-level work in their home institutions one year ahead of schedule.  A two-day ISMS pre-conference for undergraduates, analogous to the Gordon Research Seminar series for graduate students, builds a community of young researchers and raises the level of undergraduate presentations at the main conference. The new spectroscopic methods demonstrated in this proposal are applicable for a wide range of problems in physical and inorganic chemistry, from photocatalysis to solar cell design.<br/><br/>Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at femtosecond resolution is used to resolve the details of the spin relaxation process in a series of transition metal complexes. The Vura-Weis group further extends its capabilities to measure vibrational dynamics during the spin crossover. The interplay between electron transfer and spin dynamics is a key factor in the photophysics and reactivity of complexes containing open-shell transition metals. The Vura-Weis group uses the spin-state specificity and femtosecond time resolution of XUV transient absorption to measure the relaxation cascade of iron polypyridyl complexes, specifically focusing on the potential role of a short-lived metal-centered triplet state. The interplay between electron transfer and spin crossover in Prussian Blues is being measured in a series of discrete cyano-bridged iron-cobalt systems. In this case, the element specificity of XUV absorption allows the dynamics of each metal to be independently probed.  The particular molecular motions that gate the electron dynamics are identified by element-specific XUV impulsive coherent vibrational spectroscopy.  To make research in physical chemistry more accessible to undergraduates, a winter school on spectroscopy takes place at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in connection with the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy (ISMS).  In addition, a two-day undergraduate meeting preceding this conference develops a supportive community of young researchers."

In freshwater habitats, major progress toward clearly linking biology and geomorphology to address environmental problems includes incorporating the role of the many small animals that live in streams into our understanding of erosion. This research project investigates how bottom-dwelling invertebrates in streams influence flood disturbance by regulating the stability of the riverbed. Sediment erosion is a critical variable in freshwater ecosystems because it influences freshwater biodiversity, insect and fish egg survival, changes the composition and activity of algae, and alters carbon and nutrient cycling. An understanding of sediment erosion that includes the impacts of bottom-dwelling animals will address a range of practical problems relevant to society, including informing models to predict erosion in landscapes altered by land use, predicting the impacts of floods that are being altered worldwide as a result of changes to water levels caused by climate warming and diversion for agriculture, and protecting and restoring habitat for threatened freshwater organisms such as fish. This project will provide research opportunities for one PhD student, two Master students, and four undergraduate students, develop workshops to teach concepts related to bottom-dwelling invertebrate influences on sediment erosion to high school teachers, and produce outreach videos documenting sediment erosion.<br/><br/>To investigate how animals in streams influence physical resistance to flood disturbance with consequences for aquatic benthic communities and ecosystem processes, the researchers will study common aquatic ecosystem engineers, web-spinning hydropsychid caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae). These aquatic insects build silk structures that can bind riverbed sediment together, increase the force required to move sediments, and reduce bedload flux. The researchers will quantify sediment stabilization effects by caddisfly larvae from grain to landscape scales. They will also document how changes in sediment disturbance due to caddisfly silk structures influence ecosystem productivity, nutrient cycling, and the recovery of benthic communities following floods. The researchers will use a combination of controlled laboratory experiments, caddisfly density manipulations in natural streams, field surveys, and sediment transport models to identify how caddisfly ecosystem engineering affects sediment transport regimes across landscapes. Together, the series of studies will quantify how much these abundant ecosystem engineers can regulate erosional processes in streams."

The meeting is organized jointly by the Departments of Mathematics at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the University of Kansas in Lawrence.  The conference will showcase recent advances and facilitate exchange of ideas in partial differential equations (PDEs) and dynamics of complex systems. Many basic first principles in nature take the form of conservation (or balance) laws for quantities that vary in space and time, and these laws lead naturally to partial differential equations. PDEs are therefore encountered in nearly all areas of science; they describe wave motion, diffusion, deformation, mixing, pattern formation, and many other phenomena. Specific application of current interest include climate modeling, water waves, electrodynamics phenomena in complex media, and neuroscience. While participants are clustered in the Midwestern and Southern states near Missouri and Kansas, many researchers working at institutions elsewhere in the US will be included. Early career mathematicians will be given an opportunity to present their work to gain recognition and invaluable feedback. The conference website is http://faculty.missouri.edu/~walshsa/kumu2016/<br/><br/>Many of the complex nonlinear problems governed by PDEs can be reframed as dynamical systems posed on infinite-dimensional spaces.  This strategy has proved to be effective, and it certainly shows tremendous promise as a means to attack a host of open problems in nonlinear science. To realize this promise, a strong and continuing collaboration between the PDE and dynamics communities is essential. The goals of the KUMU Conference are to support and facilitate this collaboration. The major themes of this year's meeting are as follows: applications of dynamical system techniques to fluid mechanics and water waves; dynamics of dispersive PDEs; and index formulas in the study of stability of nonlinear waves.  Each of these topics has generated a great deal of recent activity.  The KUMU Conference will help to advance this research."

In the past, all Mn dissolved in seawater was thought to exist in only one chemical form: Mn(II).  Recent work in waters and sediments with little or no oxygen has shown that Mn(III) can be the dominant form of dissolved Mn and can even be present in oxygenated water if attached to specific organic molecules called ligands. This research will further investigate these discoveries, aiming to quantify the chemical and microbiological processes responsible for Mn(III) cycling under varying oxygen concentrations. The research will compare field sites in the Broadkill River wetland, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary; measuring the water column and sediments known to have strong oxygen gradients and different organic carbon sources that could change the availability and binding strength of ligands that would stabilize dissolved Mn(III). In some chemical forms, Mn tends to act like iron, so this research may have broader implications by helping marine chemists to understand more about iron cycling in similar oxygen gradients. With growing concerns over diminished oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) in the ocean, and particularly in coastal regions, understanding the reactions of Mn(III) with organic ligands across oxygen gradients could become important for understanding Mn availability to organisms. The project includes support for the participation and mentoring of one graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers, and there will be a U.S.-Canada collaboration. A variety of public outreach activities are planned with a K-12 teacher to be selected as a participant on a research cruise.<br/><br/>Mn(III) has only recently been recognized as an important redox state for Mn in seawater. Previously, it was widely accepted that all Mn that passes through a 0.2 or 0.4 m filter is dissolved Mn(II) while the retained portion is solid Mn(III, IV) oxide.  Research in the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay has shown that soluble Mn(III) can be up to 100% of the dissolved Mn in the water column.  Also, Mn(III) can exist as complexes with organic ligands in oxygenated seawater. This project will quantify and constrain the mechanisms surrounding weak and strong Mn(III) ligand transformations across vertical and horizontal oxygen gradients.  Field sites to be studied include systems with a variety of organic carbon sources and oxygen dynamics: the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, and Broadkill River wetland estuary. This research will continue to inform the fundamental shift that is taking place in our current understanding of Mn biogeochemistry in coastal systems.  The results should also be applicable to redox processes involving Fe(III) ligand transformations, since Mn and Fe tend to exhibit similar redox chemistry under similar environmental conditions."

These models capture the basic physics of climate change, but their utility is limited by uncertainties in the representation of important feedback effects.  For example in the snow albedo feedback (SAF) warmer conditions lead to reductions in snow cover, replacing a highly reflective snow surface with darker underlying ground cover which absorbs more sunlight, thereby enhancing the initial warming (the opposite holds in a cooling climate).  In this project the PIs seek to improve the representation of feedbacks in GCMs by relating observations of present-day climate to simulations of climate change.  To do this the PIs use the method of ""emergent constraints"", which in this context refers to relationships between present-day and future climate change simulations which are robust across an ensemble of GCMs.  Previous work by the PIs has shown that the strength of the SAF calculated from future climate simulations is strongly correlated with the SAF derived from the seasonal cycle in present-day simulations from the same models.  The SAF derived from the present-day seasonal cycle can be compared with real-world observations, thus providing a means to use available observations to determine which GCMs are most likely to correctly represent the SAF contribution to climate change.  The constraint is emergent in the sense that it emerges from a physically motivated examination of the robust collective behavior of an ensemble of GCMs, rather than from a first-principles derivation.<br/><br/>The PIs' previous work (see AGS-0135136) established the usefulness of emergent constraints as a way to validate feedback strength in climate change simulations, and the present work seeks to go beyond validation and use such constraints as a means to improve the representation of feedbacks in models. Model development is a more challenging application of emergent constraints than model validation, as the constraints must be specifically related to particular physical parameterizations in the model. In particular, the PIs seek to identify aspects of the land surface component model of the GCM which are key determinants of SAF strength, and determine how they can be adjusted to reduce biases in SAF strength.  Possible candidates include the apportionment of snow between the ground and the vegetation canopy.  The scope of the work may be expanded to consider the sea ice albedo feedback, which operates similarly to SAF as described above and includes a role for snow on sea ice in determining feedback strength.<br/><br/>Further research will consider emergent constraints that determine the extent to which the global hydrological cycle responds to global warming induced by greenhouse gas increases.  The global hydrological cycle is expected to accelerate in a warming climate, with increases in global evaporation and precipitation at a rate of a few percent per degree of warming.  The reasons for expecting acceleration are well understood, but there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of the acceleration, as represented by the large model-to-model spread in climate change simulations.  Work here attempts to derive emergent constraints for the hydrological cycle by examining the changes in the atmospheric energy budget that accompany changes in precipitation and evaporation.  The emergent constraints connect precipitation-related changes in atmospheric energy budgets from climate change simulations to aspects of atmospheric energetics in present-day simulations, which can then be compared to satellite-based observations.   Preliminary work shows, for example, that the clear sky shortwave absorption in climate change simulations is highly correlated with the sensitivity of clear sky shortwave absorption to total precipitable water (TPW) in control simulations. This constraint is of interest because sensitivity to TPW can be constrained by satellite observations, and it is also closely related to the parameterization of shortwave radiative transfer in GCMs.<br/><br/>The reduction of uncertainty in model projections of future climate change is of societal as well as scientific interest, as reductions in uncertainty would increase the value of climate change projections used by stakeholders and policy makers confronting the possible impacts of climate change.  The PIs will work directly with modeling centers in their model development work, convening special sessions at annual scientific meetings in which results of the project will be shared and key members of the modeling community will offer guidance.  Results of these sessions will be synthesized in research publications, in an effort to catalyze a broad effort to improve model parameterizations.<br/><br/>In addition, an outreach activity is planned to explain climate models and their uncertainties to the general public. Despite the clear need for accurate, up-to-date, and easily comprehensible information about GCMs, their sources of uncertainty, and the work being done to improve them, such information is not easily available at present.  To address this need the project will develop and maintain a website to serve as an educational resource on climate modeling. The website will contain a GCM primer, discussion of sources of uncertainty, and an assessment of the strengths and limitations of GCMs.  Further outreach will be conducted through public lectures and demonstrations held at the Discovery Cube, a local science museum.  This outreach will include the development of videos to be presented on a Science on a Sphere (SoS) display, and these will be available for use on other SoS displays worldwide.  Finally, the project provides for the education and training of a graduate student, thereby developing the future workforce in this scientific area."

One <br/>fascinating phenomenon that has been measured in radio light is a faint, diffuse glow which covers the <br/>entire sky.  This glow is best described as the ""Radio Synchrotron Background"", where the term <br/>""synchrotron"" refers to particles making radio waves when they spin around magnetic fields.  Interest in the ""Radio <br/>Synchrotron Background"" has been rekindled recently because of new measurements.  This radio glow <br/>presents a mystery because it is difficult to explain how it came to be there with known astrophysical <br/>processes.  It represents one of the mysteries of contemporary astrophysics.  While there have been <br/>many publications in the literature on this topic, there has not yet been a scientific workshop.  <br/><br/>We will hold the first scientific workshop on the radio synchrotron background, which will bring <br/>together scientists working in these overlapping fields to discuss the radio synchrotron background in <br/>person for the first time.  There are implications for many areas of active research in contemporary <br/>astrophysics.  The workshop will inspire new collaborations and new lines of inquiry, and may spur <br/>future meetings on the topic.  This project funds travel support toward allowing scientists to attend the <br/>workshop as well as for a talk for the public and for a report for the scientific community on the <br/>outcome of the meeting.  The workshop will be held at the University of Richmond.  <br/><br/>The Radio Synchrotron Background is a newly re-appreciated astrophysical phenomenon which has been <br/>a subject of great interest to many in the community. Combining the ARCADE 2 balloon-based absolute <br/>spectrum data from 3-90 GHz with absolutely calibrated single-dish diffuse radio surveys at lower <br/>frequencies reveals a radio synchrotron excess that is several times brighter than was expected by <br/>many.  The origin of the radio synchrotron background is one of the mysteries of contemporary <br/>astrophysics.  It is difficult to produce the observed level of surface brightness by known processes <br/>without violating constraints.  <br/><br/>The existence of the radio background at the observed levels presents profound challenges for our <br/>current understanding of radio emission in the Galaxy and the universe.  As demonstrated in many <br/>recent publications, there are implications for many areas of astrophysics, including cosmic ray <br/>propagation, galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, the radio to far-infrared correlation, radio source <br/>counts, X-ray source counts, quasar luminosity functions, dark matter annihilation, polarization of <br/>foregrounds in microwave background maps, population III stars, mergers of clusters, and many more.   <br/><br/>The workshop will feature plenary sessions made up of multiple presentations by attendees <br/>interspersed with and question and discussion periods centered around different topics that study of <br/>the radio synchrotron background touches.  The visual component of individual presentations, in the <br/>form of PDF, PowerPoint, or similar files will be made available on the Web.  Additionally, a report will <br/>be prepared for the scientific community on the outcome of the meeting.

Exactly how different species compete with each other for this iron is poorly understood. This project uses state-of-the-art methods to evaluate whether one well established mechanism in brewer's yeast may also be operating in marine diatoms or whether these organisms use novel, previously undescribed, mechanisms for iron uptake. The collection of massive data sets on thousands of proteins will reveal proteins that are turned on in response to low iron conditions, and newly emerging genetic tools will allow us to robustly test which proteins could be directly responsible for iron uptake. This will dramatically improve the understanding of these ecologically important organisms.  More broadly speaking, this may lead to a better understanding of iron uptake in other related organisms, which include human and agricultural pathogens.  The investigators will work closely with high school students from under-represented groups and engage them in STEM activities tightly linked to the project.  Hands on experiments will be conducted to communicate the concepts of nutrient uptake, using lakes across an urban-rural gradient as the classroom.  Additional exercises will introduce students to the cutting-edge approaches that identify thousands of proteins. Select HS students will work in the investigator's laboratories. The attitudes and perceptions of these students will be evaluated to gauge the effect of the experience on their understanding of, and desire to engage in, STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>The chromalveolates, which include diatoms and haptophytes, are the most successful and biogeochemically significant eukaryotic phytoplankton in the contemporary ocean. The evidence for iron (Fe) limitation in the oceans has led to an emphasis to understand how phytoplankton compete for and acquire Fe, but this is in its adolescence (diatoms) or infancy (Phaeocystis). This work will resolve long-standing controversies regarding the mechanisms of Fe uptake in a model diatom, T. pseudonana, and the haptophyte Phaeocystis globosa. Objectives include to quantify the proteomes of these species grown under low and high Fe (with recent advances in proteomic methodology), further utilize robust emergent reverse genetics tools to evaluate the localization of key proteins and couple these approaches with kinetics to determine which proteins and redox states are important for Fe uptake. MS^E-based proteomics with ion mobility spectrometry, ideally suited for quantifying cell surface proteins, will be used. Then, for T. pseudonana, knockdown and over-expression clones will be used to confirm localization and test phenotypic responses under varied conditions. Fe uptake and Fe(II) production rates by these clones will help determine which proteins and Fe redox states are important for Fe uptake. Manipulations of gene expression for putative diatom Fe acquisition proteins will be emphasized to address specific hypotheses, but these approaches may also be adapted to take advantage of any novel proteins derived from proteomics. Full participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines will be realized at various educational levels, and the success of these efforts with HS students will be evaluated."

The cortex, which lies just below the outer membrane of the cell, consists primarily of polymerized filaments of the protein actin. These actin filaments are cross-linked by a variety of proteins that can reorient and even move the filaments, making the cortex a highly dynamic structure. Despite the importance of the actin cortex for critical cell functions, it is not clear how small scale interactions give rise to large scale patterns and functions associated with the cortex. This project will use mathematical modeling to bridge disparate time and space scales associated with cortical actin dynamics, directly linking molecular level interactions to the emergence of cell level functional structures. For this project, novel models will be constructed that draw on a variety of mathematical approaches, including stochastic models which take into account infrequent interactions, and continuum models which can track the moving boundary of the cortex as well movement of proteins in time and space. The development and analysis of these biologically based models will result in an improved understanding of actin and its regulation in a cellular context. This research will also be leveraged to recruit and retain women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields through the development of an integrated undergraduate course in mathematical modeling, with recruitment of students through a number of existing programs at Ohio State University, including Women in Mathematics and Science and Women in Engineering. Students involved in this project, and in the undergraduate course, will be exposed to real world mathematics applications and will interact with peers from other disciplines in a supportive interdisciplinary environment.<br/><br/>Mathematical modeling is an ideal tool for the investigation of complex biological systems, where experimental techniques are not available or are not feasible. At the macro-scale level, systems of partial differential equations  will be used to investigate the interplay between biochemical and mechanical actin dynamics, and the consequence of these dynamics on cell shape. Asymptotic analysis will be used to explicitly study the role of curvature in actin dynamics, and moving boundary simulations will be used to study changes in cell shape. At the mesoscale level, integro-differential equations, which use integral kernels to describe actin filament dynamics, will be used to study the formation of large scale actin filament patterns such as asters, vortices and aggregates. At the micro-scale level, stochastic individual-based models will be used to determine physical properties of the local actin meshwork and to determine under what conditions the actin meshwork behaves as a viscoelastic material. By enforcing consistency across multiple time and space scales in the proposed models, mechanisms that give rise to cellular structures will be revealed. Analysis and simulations of these models will present unique challenges leading to improvement of techniques in several areas of applied mathematics, including asymptotic analysis, moving boundary simulations, nonlocal model analysis, and stochastic simulations. The proposed models will be motivated and validated in a single experimental organism, avoiding complications from combining in vitro data with in vivo data from multiple organisms and cell types. The integrated computational and analytical models resulting from this research will increase our understanding of a fundamental protein that is critical for proper cell function."

In freshwater habitats, major progress toward clearly linking biology and geomorphology to address environmental problems includes incorporating the role of the many small animals that live in streams into our understanding of erosion. This research project investigates how bottom-dwelling invertebrates in streams influence flood disturbance by regulating the stability of the riverbed. Sediment erosion is a critical variable in freshwater ecosystems because it influences freshwater biodiversity, insect and fish egg survival, changes the composition and activity of algae, and alters carbon and nutrient cycling. An understanding of sediment erosion that includes the impacts of bottom-dwelling animals will address a range of practical problems relevant to society, including informing models to predict erosion in landscapes altered by land use, predicting the impacts of floods that are being altered worldwide as a result of changes to water levels caused by climate warming and diversion for agriculture, and protecting and restoring habitat for threatened freshwater organisms such as fish. This project will provide research opportunities for one PhD student, two Master students, and four undergraduate students, develop workshops to teach concepts related to bottom-dwelling invertebrate influences on sediment erosion to high school teachers, and produce outreach videos documenting sediment erosion.<br/><br/>To investigate how animals in streams influence physical resistance to flood disturbance with consequences for aquatic benthic communities and ecosystem processes, the researchers will study common aquatic ecosystem engineers, web-spinning hydropsychid caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae). These aquatic insects build silk structures that can bind riverbed sediment together, increase the force required to move sediments, and reduce bedload flux. The researchers will quantify sediment stabilization effects by caddisfly larvae from grain to landscape scales. They will also document how changes in sediment disturbance due to caddisfly silk structures influence ecosystem productivity, nutrient cycling, and the recovery of benthic communities following floods. The researchers will use a combination of controlled laboratory experiments, caddisfly density manipulations in natural streams, field surveys, and sediment transport models to identify how caddisfly ecosystem engineering affects sediment transport regimes across landscapes. Together, the series of studies will quantify how much these abundant ecosystem engineers can regulate erosional processes in streams."

They have been used to analyze the threat potential of the cybersecurity of power grids, wireless networks, and many others.  Attack trees for real-world security scenarios can grow to be quite complex and manipulating such large and complex trees without a formal semantics can be dangerous.  The intellectual merits of the research are twofold: 1) It develops, using the power of linear logic and category theory, a new mathematical semantics of attack trees that is more general than existing models; 2) It designs a new domain-specific programming language for conducting threat analysis using attack trees. The language is specifically designed for not only the construction and manipulation of attack trees, but also for the ability to verify properties of attack trees. The project's broader significance and importance are improvement of security and reliability of software, training of a diverse group of undergraduate students at Georgia Regents University in principles of programming languages and security, and exposing them to research.<br/><br/>The project's first step is to give attack trees a categorical semantics in symmetric monoidal categories. Then based on this semantics, and the connection between linear logic and symmetric monoidal categories, the project develops a new<br/>statically-typed linear functional programming language called Lina (Linear Threat Analysis). Types in Lina correspond to attack trees, and programs between attack trees correspond to semantically valid transformations of attack trees.  Therefore, designing and manipulating complex attack trees in Lina provides a higher confidence that the resulting analysis is correct."

Currently, the most well-established method for lung function testing is spirometry, which requires the patient to conduct an unnatural breathing maneuver. In addition, spirometry cannot detect certain lung conditions. The proposed technology will be used without special breathing maneuver, and will be able to differentiate more lung conditions than spirometer. Since the proposed device can be used while the patient is breathing normally, it will also cater to currently under-served patient segments, e.g. young children and senior citizens, for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions. By targeting a portable form-factor, the proposed technology will empower point-of-care pulmonary testing where it is currently infeasible.<br/> <br/>The proposed project will develop the first handheld implementation of the well-studied principle of forced oscillation technique (FOT), where an acoustic pressure wave is sent via the mouth to a patient's lungs and reflections are used to measure lung function.

Cognita Labs will adopt a modular approach for product design, and develop product-caliber advanced and integrated devices, that will include hardware, tablet app and EHR integration. The design will include all the innovations developed during Phase I to reduce the device size and cost while increasing its measurement accuracy. The proposed device will further develop and integrate a new ultra-sound based non-invasive sensor into the device to significantly reduce the cost of the consumable (disposable mouthpiece) and ultimately the cost of test.

A wide variety of species including invertebrates (clams, crabs, mollusks), fish, and birds make their home and forage in this region. Coasts are also centers of tourism and recreation, fueling economic activity. Water temperature is known to be highly variable here in space and over time, playing a critical role in many components of nearshore ecosystems. In the deeper water of the continental-shelf (depths 12-100 m) heat budget has been extensively studied and the cross-shelf export of heat has been quantified. However, in shallower water, the coupled heat budget of the surfzone (where the shallow depth causes wave breaking)  and the inner-shelf just offshore has not been studied. Thus, the processes that drive nearshore temperature variability are poorly understood and unique physical processes that affect this region?s heat budget have not been considered. This project will use data from a new 9-month field experiment that resolved the thermal structure from the shoreline to 6m water depth to characterize key processes that drive temperature variability in the nearshore such as heat transfer by rip currents, mixing by breaking internal waves, local heat generation upon the dissipation of gravity wave energy, and the reflection of solar energy by foam and bubbles due to breaking waves.  Analysis of these unique data will improve understanding of the physical processes governing temperature (heat) evolution that can be applied to the broad range of economically and ecologically important nearshore regions. This work will have application to nonlinear internal wave transformation and related mixing. Nearshore temperature evolution and cross-shore fluxes are tightly linked to the ecology of bacterial pathogens, diatoms, larvae, and invertebrates in this region. Elevated surfzone albedo may explain surfzone persistence of harmful pathogens, with human health implications. This work will also have implications for internal wave driven larval transport into and across the nearshore. Research and education will be integrated at all academic levels. This project will train a PhD student who was involved in all aspects of the field work. An outreach collaboration will be developed with an AP Environmental Science class at the underserved Kearny Science High School, developing curriculum materials, teaching lectures, and hosting a field trip. Undergraduate students will be engaged through the SIO REU program.<br/><br/>Although nonlinear internal-wave driven nearshore temperature variability has previously been observed at a single  location, the full cross-shore, vertical, and temporal variability of the coupled surfzone and inner-shelf has yet to be characterized. A pilot surfzone heat budget showed that a full coupled surfzone inner-shelf heat budget was feasible and that surface gravity wave energy flux heated the surfzone at a rate on average a quarter of the solar radiation, indicating its importance to the heat budget. A new 9-month long field experiment on the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) pier, designed to close the coupled surfzone/inner-shelf heat budget, has just been completed.  The experiment, executed by 3rd year graduate student Greg Sinnett, highly resolved the spatio-temporal structure of temperature from the shoreline to 6-m water depth over almost a full seasonal cycle. In addition, 3 ADCP current meters were deployed to measure advective heat fluxes and a pier-deployed 4-way radiometer was deployed to measure surfzone and inner-shelf albedo. These extensive new field observations will be analyzed to close a coupled surfzone and inner-shelf heat budget and quantify the magnitude and variability of the heat budget terms. In particular, this region has unique processes influencing the heat budget that have yet to be considered or properly quantified. The surfzone albedo (due to foam or whitewater) may be significantly elevated over open ocean albedo, thereby reducing surfzone solar heating. However, surfzone albedo has not been quantified and the factors influencing it are not understood. This study will quantify surfzone albedo, determine its importance in reducing surfzone incident solar radiation, and develop albedo parameterizations. The pilot surfzone heat budget found that surface gravity wave heating was important relative to solar radiation during summer when waves are small and days long. This analysis will quantify the relative importance of wave heating from late summer to early spring. In the pilot study, advective heat flux was inferred (not measured) to drive significant temperature variability and on average cool the surfzone. Two physical mechanisms driving heat fluxes are nonlinear internal waves and rip currents. The observations will be used to quantify the advective heat flux across the nearshore, its magnitude and time-scales, and examine the mechanisms driving it, and potential feedbacks with incident waves or barotropic tides. Thus, the project will provide a detailed understanding of the processes governing nearshore temperature variation and will allow for the parameterization of some of these processes."

In this collaborative work between Princeton and Penn State Universities, unusually well-controlled measurements of frictional sliding will be conducted while collecting simultaneous ultrasonic data on the sliding interfaces and sheared layers of fault gouge. The proposed work has important societal implications for seismic hazard assessment, earthquake forecasting, and an improved, fundamental understanding of earthquake nucleation.<br/><br/>Rate-and-state friction laws represent the current state-of-the-art in the laboratory and for numerical simulations of earthquake physics, including nucleation, dynamic rupture and the complete seismic cycle.  However, our understanding of friction memory effects and slip velocity dependence remains primarily empirical, which limits our ability to apply laboratory measurements to earthquake faults and/or to address the problems associated with predicting the behavior of tectonic faults from laboratory measurements.  To address these shortcomings, recent advances in ultrasonic monitoring of sliding rock surfaces and sheared granular fault gouge will provide fundamental insights into the physics and micro-mechanical origins of frictional behavior of tectonic faults. <br/>"

The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2016 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2016), which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI) and will be held May 7-12 in San Jose, California. The annual CHI conference is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and is attended by approximately 3,400 HCI professionals from around the world. Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI. More information about the conference is available at https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/. The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. The event's organizers are committed to diversity.  Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2016 have already been selected; there are 8 men and 7 women, and there is only one student from any given university.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers. Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. During the two full days of the Consortium on May 7-8, each student participant will have a 45-minute time slot in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panel and the other student participants. The feedback is geared to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Follow up activities including two poster sessions,  are planned during the technical program of the conference on May 9-12. Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2016 Extended Abstracts. SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia. The CHI doctoral consortia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading HCI researchers participated as students in earlier consortia."

Alternatives were only considered after the discovery of chlorine's organohalogen byproducts in the 1970s. Thus, there is a critical need for a safe, more efficient disinfection technology that is capable of destroying contaminants while minimizing disinfection byproducts and operational costs. The overarching goal of this project is to create a new paradigm of protein-based materials for water quality engineering.<br/><br/>The proposed work will advance fundamental knowledge in the field of photocatalytic oxidation and disinfection, as it represents the first selective, metal-free, protein photocatalyst. The research will help inform future work by providing operating metrics and theory of catalytic function. Since the design is modular, a suite of future protein catalysts targeting other biohazards could easily be derived. Engineering a protein reactive oxygen photocatalyst that is target-specific will enable lower catalyst loadings, limiting disinfection byproducts and application costs. This project will advance the application of synthetic biology to environmental engineering and provide a foundation for designing future protein-based materials. The scientific objective of the proposed work is to experimentally elucidate the fundamental behavior of the photocatalyst and use these insights to inform the design of a modular protein-based disinfection technology. This technology will be validated against a chemically-resistant human pathogen, Cryptosporidium. The proposed research consists of three tasks: 1. Construction of enhanced protein photocatalysts for improved quantum efficiency and reactive oxygen production, 2) Examination of reactive oxygen speciation and generation rate to understand and optimize catalytic function, and 3) apply the biological photocatalysts to the most resistant water borne pathogens such as cyst-forming protozoa. Blending molecular biological tools with the environmental engineering field of advanced oxidation requires is paramount to advancing the area of disinfection. More broadly, the research will provide fundamental insight into how the catalyst works, leading to future variants with a range of disinfection applications. The new knowledge produced will serve as the basis for protein photocatalyst applications that will clean environmental and engineered waters and improve human health. The education and outreach components will enable opportunities for under-represented groups and minorities to learn the latest in synthetic biological engineering skills. Biological engineering relies on a variety of online tools, and as a result, the principal investigator's (PI's) present course curricula integrate tablets into the classroom. Using a real-time classroom web platform that the PI developed for mobile devices, this model could be implemented in science classrooms across the country. The PI will continue working with Research Experiences for Teachers which involves mentoring the construction of a bioluminescent water quality exhibit for the Newport Aquarium. This exhibit will provide a new teaching tool for the aquarium's education outreach WAVE foundation and high school classrooms."

By sharing complementary resources at both the University of Wyoming (UW) and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), the program will sustainably expand capacity, support enriched, non-academic and academic experiences for students, and allow trainees to participate in broadening activities early in their graduate careers, saving later years for intensive work on dissertation projects so that time to degree will not be affected. Prior to the start of formal thesis research, students will develop mathematical and statistical approaches to tackle problems arising in other areas of science and engineering. Each doctoral student supported by FRAMEWORK will spend one or two summer periods working on interdisciplinary research problems in collaboration with an external partner from industry, a national laboratory, or a research institution. Due to these summer research experiences, the students will be well positioned to continue work at the external partners' organizations, thereby gaining experience that could ultimately lead to employment opportunities after graduation.  Ultimately, the program will broaden the range of career paths for Ph.D. graduates in the mathematical sciences, and increase the both the quality and quantity of students who complete internships, enter the industrial workforce, and accept postdoctoral positions at national labs. Finally, the FRAMEWORK program will also serve a recruiting tool to increase the number of qualified U.S. students who apply to Ph.D. programs, especially women and under-represented minorities. <br/><br/>The FRAMEWORK program contains four central elements: (1) Summer internship opportunities at nonacademic organizations, which will introduce PhD students to applications outside their coursework such as technical communication, project management, proposal writing, and budget development; (2) Annual end-of-summer workshops, during which incoming PhD students will be trained in writing skills and the previous cohort's internship experiences will be showcased; (3) A course exchange program that will enable the shared delivery of foundational graduate courses so that other faculty members will be free to offer new advanced and special-topics courses; and (4) The targeted recruitment of community-college and baccalaureate students at non-doctoral institutions, which will enhance the diversity of the Ph.D. pipeline. A variety of external partners, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Western Research Institute, and the Wyoming Technology Business Center, have agreed to collaborate on this project. In consultation with these partners, the FRAMEWORK program has developed broad research problems that complement the strengths of faculty mentors at UW and CSM. Proposed projects include uncertainty quantification for subsurface flow and renewable energy problems, the modeling and simulation of infectious disease dynamics, and computational methods for detecting material flaws in the wheels of railroad cars, among others. The writing workshops, special-topics courses, and summer internship programs will introduce students to professional skills and nonacademic opportunities that are atypical for traditional doctoral programs.  In general, this collaborative venture will serve as a portable model for other, similarly paired institutions to cooperate in enhancing doctoral education throughout the nation."

Comparisons of DNA sequences have been used to build reliable evolutionary trees for many groups of organisms. Yet in cases where species hybridize with one another (or have done so in the past), their descendants become a mosaic of genetic backgrounds, and this genetic mixing makes it more difficult to back-calculate their past relationships. Hybridization is particularly common in groups of species that have undergone rapid radiations - situations when large numbers of species evolve over a relatively short period of time - while at the same time these rapid radiations are models for many other kinds of evolutionary analysis. This project will investigate the type of genomic regions that are exchanged among species during rapid radiations. A central goal of the researchers is to develop a computer program that leverages large-scale genomic data to better understand the phylogenetic relationships among species, improving the ability to incorporate the effects of past hybridization events. This tool will be made available to the research community to help biologists understand evolution at the tips of the tree of life. The project will add interactive multimedia-based modules on phylogenetics and systematics to the highly successful All About Bird Biology website.  The project is a funded collaboratively by the NSF and the Binational Science Foundation of Israel.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to test questions about the degree and type of genomic regions exchanged among species in rapid radiations, and to explore the implications for phylogenetic inference. These objectives are based on the further development of a new bioinformatics tool (Generalized Phylogenetic Coalescent Sampler - G-PhoCS) that will allow scientists studying non-model organisms to test hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships and generate detailed demographic inferences (e.g., quantifying gene flow, effective population sizes and divergence times) across a phylogeny, using a variety of genomic-scale datasets. As empirical test cases, the researchers will leverage natural evolutionary experiments in two avian radiations in which pairs of species can be classified as either introgression-prone or introgression-resistant based on external criteria such as ecological overlap and sympatry/allopatry. The research team brings together systematists and computer scientists attempting to realize the full potential of newly emerging high throughput sequence data by developing inference methods that make use of the rich information they provide. This collaboration will more generally broaden the understanding of the patterns and processes underlying genealogical discordance among regions of the genome."

However, the current discovery process of such smart materials is slow and often serendipitous due to the enormously large design space and lack of systematic knowledge as well as predictive models. Indeed, a quantitative understanding of their self-assembly and disassembly processes, and how the solution condition and chemical structure govern their morphological transition, has remained elusive. To tackle these challenges and harness the full potential of smart materials, the PIs will build an integrated platform of computer-aided design using peptide-polymer conjugates by performing molecular simulations in collaboration with experimentalists in facilitating rapid development of novel stimuli-responsive nanomaterials for different biomedical applications in cancer and gene therapy. The proposed research will provide timely and invaluable tools and knowledge to move the community towards expedited discovery of smart materials that help improve lives. Specifically, the valuable insights gained from the simulation studies could lead to the development of a cancer-specific diagnostic agent and targeted gene delivery system.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the proposed CAREER research program are: 1) elucidate the sequence-structure-property relationships in solution for de novo design of PEG-conjugated peptide amphiphiles as delivery vehicles of drugs or bioimaging agents; 2) examine the crowding effects of the blood serum and in vivo conditions on stimuli-responsive self-assembly by peptide amphiphiles; 3) understand the relationship between peptide-polymer conjugate sequence and structure of siRNA complexes and mechanisms of siRNA complexation by different conjugates for gene delivery; and 4) investigate the mechanisms of intracellular trafficking of siRNA complexes and siRNA disassembly by peptide-polymer conjugates. By integrating multi-scale modeling techniques, the proposed platform will innovate and accelerate the materials discovery process in two transformative ways. First, the development of new models and simulations tools will push the boundary of multi-scale modeling and pave the way for computer-aided design of novel biomaterials. Second, the integrated in silico and in vitro and in vivo studies of sequence-structure-properties relationships and assembly/disassembly processes will generate novel, systematic knowledge that will be applied to design novel stimuli-responsive delivery vehicles for improved pharmaco-kinetic properties. <br/><br/>To broaden the impact of the planned research, the PI will integrate research into the undergraduate curricula by developing a new course on biomaterial design and offering research opportunities for undergraduate students. Furthermore, the PI will launch a summer research program for high school students to perform simple simulations in his laboratory for one week and will play an active role in training middle and high school teachers to integrate engineering concepts and hands-on experiential learning methodologies into their science curriculum."

Virtual reality is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences. VR research includes the development and assessment of methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry. More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2016. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a unique venue for interactive, supportive, and prestigious mentoring for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community. Special efforts have been made by the organizers to achieve diversity among the students across institutions, and to recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computer science, including women, persons of color, and people with disabilities. <br/><br/>This year's IEEE VR Doctoral Consortium builds on the successful format of the first three such events, which were also supported by NSF. The event will begin with a dinner on Saturday, March 19, immediately prior to the start of the IEEE 3DUI Symposium, to welcome the students and provide initial mentorship and tips for networking at the conference. The main activities will take place on Sunday, March 20, in parallel with the second day of IEEE 3DUI.  The workshop will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results. A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a ""big picture"" envisioning of the future of the field over the next 10-20 years. Each student will also be asked to prepare a poster on his/her research that will be on display during the conference as part of the poster sessions, and to submit a short (2-page) abstract to be archived in the IEEE Digital Library. The VR conference will begin that evening, with a welcome reception where Doctoral Consortium participants will network with what they have learned over the first two days. Additional smaller activities will take place at scattered times over the rest of the week; in particular, small groups of 2-3 students will meet for mentoring lunches and/or other networking events with senior members of the VR/3DUI community."

Nanopositioning stages are mechanical devices used for precise positioning in a wide range of nanotech processes, ranging from spectroscopy to micro additive manufacturing. Hence their positioning speed and cost are critical to the throughput and scale up of many nanotech processes. Stages that use roller bearings are currently the only commercially viable option for a growing number of large-displacement nanopositioning applications performed in ultrahigh vacuum environments. However, roller bearing stages suffer from very low positioning speeds due to the adverse effects of so-called pre-rolling friction. This award supports a scientific investigation into a novel approach for mitigating the effects of pre-rolling friction on roller bearing nanopositioning stages by applying high frequency vibration to the stage. Results from this research will increase the positioning speed of roller bearing nanopositioning stages without significantly increasing their costs, hence enabling the scale up and increased throughput of a wide range of nanotech processes. <br/><br/>This research is focused on vibration-assisted nanopositioning: a novel approach for applying high frequency vibration, combined with active vibration control, to nanopositioning stages. The objective of this research is to understand the interactions between high frequency vibration, pre-rolling friction, controller dynamics, and positioning speed. The method of direct partition of motion will be used to determine the influence of vibration parameters (vibration frequency and amplitude) on pre-rolling friction and stage position control, under ideal conditions where there is no active vibration control. Perturbation analyses (e.g., using the Poincar-Lindstedt method) will then be carried out to understand the effects of active vibration control combined with high frequency vibration on the vibration of the stage. Control techniques that will be investigated include sliding mode control and harmonic cancellation control. In all analyses, pre-rolling friction will be modeled with increasing levels of complexity, starting from the simple Dahl model and building up to the Generalized Maxwell Slip model, in order to gain progressive insights into the effects of each model and its parameters on the results of the analyses. A simple roller bearing nanopositioning stage will be used to conduct point-to-point positioning experiments, with various high frequency vibration frequencies/amplitudes, friction conditions, and control techniques, to validate the theoretical analyses."

Students complete independent research projects relating to the health, activity patterns, diet, and genetic relatedness of people at the Greek colony and battlefield of Himera to better understand the biocultural consequences of culture contact in the past. Globalization is ever-increasing and often resembles colonization with its spread of ideas and people to developing nations. REU students will learn first-hand about deep roots and biological dimensions of interactions between diverse populations. Participants receive specialized field and lab training in archaeological chemistry, anatomy, research design, and data analysis. Students will leave the REU with greater technical and analytical skills, better preparedness for graduate study and professional careers, and heightened awareness of global issues relating to population contact, inequality, human conflict, and health transitions. These skills are foundational for improving global citizenship and stewardship in any career.<br/><br/>To promote scientific literacy and global engagement among undergraduates, this three-year REU Site integrates students as junior partners of the Bioarchaeology of Mediterranean Colonies Project, a cross-disciplinary, international research program that has brought undergraduate students to the Mediterranean for the past three summers. REU students generate new anthropological knowledge related to human adaptation and the impacts of culture contact in the ancient Mediterranean. Student projects focus on the more than 12,000 skeletons unearthed at Himera, which in the 7-5th centuries B.C. was the site of Greek colonizing efforts and violent battles. Himera represents an early epicenter of rising ethnic inequality. REU students plan and execute independent research projects exploring biocultural impacts of culture contact in Greek Sicily, including changes in diet, activity patterns, health, mobility, and genetic admixture, using stable isotope biogeochemistry, molecular anthropology, osteology, paleopathology and statistical analysis. Students collect bioarchaeological data from human skeletons at Sicily for four weeks, and spend the remaining four weeks at the University of Georgia (UGA) apprenticed in the UGA Bioarchaeology and Biochemistry Laboratory, analyzing field specimens. REU students participate in focused workshops and seminars, and work with dedicated mentors, receiving hands-on training for research projects. Through these activities, students (1) learn archaeological and anthropological field and lab methods, (2) learn from both American and Italian scholars, (3) visit museums and archaeological sites on Sicily, (4) design, execute, and present independent research projects that make substantive contributions to anthropology, (5) live in the city of Palermo, Italy where they will interact with Italian students and citizens, and (6) remain in close contact with faculty mentors for a full academic year to publish their results and present at international conferences. Two PhD student affiliates will gain mentorship training. REU students will leave better prepared to pursue and succeed in graduate school, excel in STEM careers, and be more globally engaged citizens."

This episode, which saw the origin and rapid diversification of almost all major groups of animals (phyla), serves to divide the entire geologic record into two parts, the Precambrian and Phanerozoic Eons. By far, the best records of this event come from a handful of exceptional fossil deposits that preserve the ?soft?, non-biomineralized tissues of organisms that normally leave no trace in the fossil record. Such deposits offer not only a remarkable view of the early patterns of evolution, but have helped to reveal the basic structure of the animal family tree. Recently, the most important Cambrian fossil assemblage discovered in decades was reported from the Burgess Shale near Marble Canyon. <br/>This project seeks to provide baseline characterization of the new fossil assemblage and its geological and geochemical context though a multi-disciplinary approach, which will provide hands on training for undergraduates and a postdoctoral scholar. The goals of the project are: 1. to document the geographic extent and composition of the new fossil fauna by exploration and quarrying; 2. to use geochemical and sedimentologic methods to reconstruct the nature of ancient environments in which these fossil assemblages thrived; 3. to develop a strontium isotope chronology linking all Burgess Shale localities in relative time, and; 4. to determine the origin of the Cathedral Escarpment, an enigmatic topographic feature that is central to the Geologic history of the Burgess Shale."

Many of these materials become superconducting at sufficiently low temperature. The phenomenon of superconductivity is signaled by the conduction of electricity without energy loss. If materials can be discovered that exhibit superconductivity at sufficiently high temperature, then they could be used for the transmission of electrical power. This award supports research geared toward deeper understanding of the role of correlations in electron motion that arise from strong electron interaction in a family of superconducting materials which contain the element iron in their chemical composition. These materials may be stepping stones to developing new materials which exhibit superconductivity at higher temperatures, perhaps reaching up to room temperature. <br/><br/>The PI will develop theory to understand the implications of data obtained from experiments in which light is scattered off iron-based superconductors. Strong interactions between electrons cause the state of each electron to be determined by the motion of all other electrons. The resulting electron-electron interactions cause the electrons to self-organize and cause them to respond collectively to external stimuli. The PI and his research team will study collective behavior that arises in the broad class of iron-based superconductor materials. The PI will focus on the interplay of three types of electronic self-organization: superconductivity, magnetism, and structural order. While the individual electrons in ordinary metallic conductors lose their energy through interaction with material imperfections leading to losses, the collective flow characteristic of superconductors is rigid and cannot be easily disrupted leading to loss free transmission of electricity. Magnetism appears when the microscopic elementary magnets inside the solid all point in the same direction setting the north pole of a magnet. Structural ordering is caused by the electrons preferring a specific propagation direction. The PI will carry out a comprehensive study of all these collective phenomena within a single theoretical framework.<br/><br/>The research will have a broad impact on the scientific community and the public through conferences and journal publications, and through an existing outreach program to school children. The PI will further design university courses that incorporate modern developments in theoretical physics to train the next generation.

The PI will focus on collective phenomena in iron-based superconductors probed by light. As the collective phenomena are the fingerprints of ordering, the PI will investigate the structure and interplay of order parameters, and closely related questions of the mechanism of superconductivity and possible symbiotic relationships among magnetism, lattice deformation and superconductivity. The major objective of the proposed research is to advance understanding of collective behavior emergent at the onset of different macroscopic orders, and the interplay and the competition among ordered states. <br/><br/>The PI aims to advance analytical techniques for describing correlation effects and collective response of layered superconductors and interacting electron liquids. A variety of standard modern methods will also be used in the research. The PI aims to contribute to the understanding of universal aspects of symmetry breaking at the onset of classical and quantum phase transitions. This project also includes a study of spin transport in low dimensional systems. The collective behavior in these systems sets in due to the interaction-induced self-organization of microscopic fields felt by individual electrons. The PI will investigate enhancement of electronic quantum coherence as shown by sharp modes in Raman spectra and the ways in which correlations affect the electron dynamics.<br/><br/>The research will have a broad impact on the scientific community and the public through conferences and journal publications, and through an existing outreach program to school children.

For example, cells divide or differentiate and muscles contract. This wealth of phenomena is possible because living systems consume energy as a token to pay the toll to achieve those emergent behaviors.  The aim of this CAREER project is to provide a comprehensive picture of the key mechanisms at stake. To this end, the research team will use a bottom-up approach with a variety of experiments using artificial and microscopic building blocks, which consume energy.  The ultimate goal is to design novel, smart and active materials and bring the biological organization to the materials world. The cutting-edge research program mutually integrates with the development of a soft matter curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students. Excellence in education is transverse and relies on two strategic axes: (i) an outreach effort using the natural appeal of ""soft"" materials, e.g. splashing ketchup or cornstarch at science fairs or getting students into the lab, and (ii) a science ""without walls"" components with a bi-annual seminar.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The aim of this five-year CAREER program is to harness the out-of-equilibrium nature of synthetic colloidal active matter to explore its physical principles and create novel materials with advanced functionalities. It is an experiment-driven proposal, rooted in fundamental questions about the mechanisms of emergent phenomena in nature, here addressed with purely synthetic components. It focuses on self-organization and synchronization with different realization of self-propelled particles using microfluidics, colloid science and microscopy techniques. The thrust of this project is the wealth of original experiments, which complement each other to provide a comprehensive picture of the key mechanisms required for the emergence of complexity in non- equilibrium systems. This approach will pioneer developments beyond soft matter physics and explore uncharted fields of out-of-equilibrium physics from self-organization to motility in biology. The creation of novel materials with cutting-edge functionalities will have an impact in material science, nano- and bioengineering."

Many of these areas have very poor soils that are low in nutrients for plants, like nitrogen and phosphorus, but the growth of the grasses is often higher than expected. A key process in maintaining unexpectedly high grass growth is called nitrogen fixation, where plants acquire their nitrogen from the air. In previous work in Serengeti National Park in east Africa, it was discovered that grass roots, like more familiar legumes or members of the bean family, host abundant, active bacteria that can fix large amounts of nitrogen. The result is a complex web of various nitrogen-fixing bacteria, other associated soil microbes, the host grasses, and a diversity of grazing animals. This project builds on a long history of ecological research in Serengeti National Park and will explore how grazing, rainfall and the availability of other soil nutrients combine to affect nitrogen fixation. The work will also explore if mycorrhizal fungi, which also live in association with grass roots and benefit plants in other ways, compete with nitrogen-fixing bacteria for sugars and other forms of carbon supplied by their host plants and thus reduce bacterial nitrogen-fixation. Nitrogen limits productivity and ecosystem services in most terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen-fixation by bacteria associated with grass roots may prove to be the most important source of nitrogen and driver of productivity, ecosystem services, and rural human livelihoods in many tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas. The results will be used in an ongoing collaboration with The Nature Conservancy and other non-government organizations to help more than 40 local human communities in Tanzania and Kenya adopt new livestock and fire management practices that sequester soil carbon, improve sustainable livestock production, and potentially generate the sale of carbon credits on voluntary markets. This project will also employ and train undergraduate and graduate students through summer field courses and participation in the research.<br/><br/>This project will explore, for the first time, the key interactions among grazing animals, plants, and beneficial soil microbes centered on nitrogen fixation. It has four parts: (1) to determine the occurrence and magnitude of nitrogen fixation by many different grass species across a range of soil, grazing, and rainfall conditions, (2) to conduct experiments that will test if grazing and water, nitrogen, and phosphorus affect nitrogen-fixation by grasses differently than legumes under the same conditions, (3) to conduct experiments in large pots where AM fungi and bacteria are controlled to test for competition between these different groups of microbes, and (4) to develop and test a simple computer model that integrates how rainfall, grazing, competition with mycorrhizal fungi, or nutrient limitation interact to control nitrogen-fixation and grass productivity. This new modeling will show how the abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and beneficial fungi changes the storage of carbon as soil organic matter and leads to the development of herbivore-plant-mutualist webs that ultimately produce the key carbon inputs of above- and belowground plant litter, dung, and AM fungal hyphae to soil organic carbon. These model outcomes will be linked with recently validated modeling of soil carbon dynamics in the Serengeti to understand how nitrogen-fixation links to possible soil carbon sequestration and removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."

This system will replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments, 6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today, this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology, an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry and diagnostics.  <br/><br/>This Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.  Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.  Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2 ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

Some variants of those genes, known as mutators, increase the genomic rate of mutation. Even when mutators have no direct effect on survival and reproduction of the individual, they can experience indirect selection via genetic linkage to beneficial and deleterious mutations that occur elsewhere in the genome.  This proposal explores a novel hypothesis that population size may have an effect on indirect selection experienced by mutators. Understanding the role of population size and spatial structure in shaping the evolution of mutation rate may resolve a longstanding empirical puzzle: why mutators frequently emerge in well-mixed microbial laboratory populations, yet are only sporadically found in nature. This project has important implications for understanding both natural and directed genetic changes in basic, health, conservation, and agriculture research. For example, this research may illuminate the role of mutators during disease progression of cancer tumors.

Prior research indicates that domestic wastewater contains a wide range of pathogens, from noroviruses to hepatitis A. Wastewater workers are at increased risk of infectious illnesses compared to the general population. This proposed workshop would engage scientists, wastewater utility operators and managers, and government regulators in assessing available evidence to decide how to protect wastewater and sewer workers from occupational exposure to pathogens.<br/><br/>Increased risk of infectious illnesses among sewer and wastewater workers is well established, but little scientific evidence exists on the effectiveness of alternative measures for reducing these risks. In order to develop evidence-based solutions, information on job tasks that may lead to infectious disease exposure, potential wastewater exposure volumes for each task, current occupational safety practices among this workforce, and the potential for alternative safety practices to reduce risks, is essential. This workshop will help fill these critical information needs. The workshop will lead to four products: 1. Workshop report describing potential tasks during which wastewater and sewer workers could be exposed to pathogens, estimated exposure volumes for each task, current practices for protecting these workers from pathogens, gaps between current practices and recommended practices, and research needed to fill knowledge gaps; 2. Bayesian belief network risk model for predicting infectious disease risks under alternative risk management scenarios and for diagnosing the likelihood that an infectious illness in a wastewater or sewer worker arose from occupational exposure; 3.

This project will strengthen the evidence available for protecting the health of the approximately 136,000 wastewater and sewer workers in the United States. In turn, because wastewater treatment plants are one of the main barriers to infectious disease transmission, protecting the health of the wastewater and sewer workforce will contribute to ensuring public health in U.S. communities."

Sleep is recognized to be conserved across species, and in recent years sleep research has been extended to model organisms that provide powerful tools for genetic analysis. This project focuses on identification of genes and signaling pathways that control sleep behavior using the roundworm C. elegans as model organism. The principal investigator and her undergraduate students at California State University Northridge, a primarily undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution, have shown that exposure to environmental stresses can trigger sleep in C. elegans. Further, they demonstrated that stress-induced sleep is beneficial, and they have begun to identify several components of a genetic pathway that mediates this beneficial effect.  This project expands on this work and illuminates the mechanism through which epidermal growth factor signaling contributes to stress-induced sleep.  Additionally, the project uses cutting-edge molecular techniques to identify other genetic pathways critical in the regulation of stress-induced sleep. The broader impacts of this CAREER award include Full Immersion Research Experience (FIRE), a course the principal investigator redesigned with the goal of giving students an original research experience, and the integration of this lab course with the investigator's research program on sleep.<br/><br/>The identification of a sleep state in C. elegans that is triggered by conditions, such as noxious heat or tissue damage, suggests that perturbation of cellular homeostasis may contribute to sleep drive. Stress-induced sleep (SIS) in C. elegans may represent an ancestral state that evolved to promote recovery following environmental stress or infection. In more complex organisms, SIS may be coordinated with circadian regulation, acting to counteract perturbations of homeostasis known to be associated with prolonged wakefulness. The aim of this proposal is to characterize the genetic pathways that promote SIS. The principal investigator has shown that stress-induced sleep is dependent on Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor activation within the ALA neuroendocrine cell; however, the mechanism by which stress initiates EGF signaling is not known. The first aim of this project is to investigate how and, for the purposes of sleep regulation, in which tissues cellular stress is monitored. Because EGF family ligands are produced as transmembrane precursors that must be processed for release of soluble ligand, it is likely that EGF-dependent sleep is regulated by stress-induced ectodomain shedding. The second aim of this project is to determine from which cell(s) EGF is shed in response to stress, and to characterize a candidate protease that has been identified in an RNAi screen for sleep defects. The third and final aim of this project is to identify novel components of SIS via an unbiased forward genetic screen."

While high-latitude climates show the largest temperature changes, tropical forests take up and sequester forty percent of the anthropogenic and natural carbon exchanged with the atmosphere. Soils in these forests are the largest pool of terrestrial carbon. Under high water, low oxygen conditions, decomposition results in the production and release of methane gas (CH4)by microorganisms known as methanogens. During dry seasons, deeper rainforest soils remain wet, but dry at the surface. When that happens, a different group of microorganisms consume the methane and convert it to carbon dioxide. Methane gas has a ten to one hundred-fold greater greenhouse warming effect compared to that of carbon dioxide (CO2). Consequently, the relative release of these two gases in tropical rainforests has a large impact on the warming of climate. An unusually strong El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event is beginning to impact North America in 2015 and 2016. It is predicted that this ENSO will result in a major drought in tropical forests of Central America. Given the governing role of precipitation in soil carbon cycle, the impact of the drought from the developing ENSO is likely to be substantial. This RAPID project will test the idea that the ENSO cycle controls much of the year-to-year variability in the global carbon dioxide and methane cycle, by turning tropical forest soils from a strong source for methane during the normal rainy season, to a year-round sink for methane and source of carbon dioxide during El Nio-induced drought events.<br/><br/>Soil carbon dynamics have been measured through imaging of root and microbial production and turnover, and direct measurements of CO2 production and efflux. However, even with detailed measurements of outputs, the carbon budget developed for the Costa Rican rain forest near La Selva Biologcial Station fails to account for nearly ten percent of the total fixed C. One potential missing component in these measurements is methane (CH4). Tropical forests are both consumers and producers of CH4. During normal wet years, increased activity of methanogens relative to methanotrophs in anoxic, wet soil conditions results in methane release. Then as soils dry between storms, methanotrophs may dramatically increase rates of methane oxidation, resulting in the release of higher amounts of respired soil CO2. An unusually strong 2015-16 ENSO event has been detected in North America. ENSO-associated drought in tropical forests of Central America are likely to be extreme at the La Selva site. Specifically, it is hypothesized that: (1) large amounts of CO2 produced underground during normal, wet rainy seasons are converted to CH4, which is eventually released to the atmosphere; (2) the anaerobic soil conditions of wet rainy seasons cause even greater CH4 release through methanogenesis coupled to decomposition, and (3 during a strong El Nio event, drier conditions will result in an increase in methane oxidation by methanotrophs in these soils. To test these questions, CO2 and CH4 will be continuously measured, through the pre-ENSO, ENSO, and post-ENSO climate conditions. qPCR and RT-qPCR will be used to quantify the abundance and activity of both methane-producing (methanogens) and -consuming (methanotrophs) microorganisms. These measures will be coupled with root, understory and litter surveys to compare living and dead plant biomass that contributes the C to these microbes."

They serve an important function in the ecology and evolution of plants as visual pigments to attract animals for pollination and seed dispersal. The tremendous diversity of carotenoid pigmentation patterns found in flowers and fruits is primarily determined by regulatory genes that control when and where the carotenoid pigments are produced. However, little is known about the identity and function of these regulatory genes. This study employs a new plant genetic model system, monkeyflowers, to identify carotenoid-regulating genes and to characterize their function. The discovery and characterization of these regulatory genes are crucial to understanding how carotenoid production is controlled during flower development and how carotenoid-based flower color variation is generated during evolution. From a practical perspective, because carotenoids are also essential components of human diets as precursors for vitamin A biosynthesis, the regulatory genes discovered in this study have the potential for high translational impact in plant breeding to enhance carotenoid production in crop plants. The plant materials will be incorporated into a live plant exhibit at the University of Connecticut to demonstrate concepts of genetics and evolution for student and public education. Furthermore, the flower images, pollination videos, and interactive, multimedia illustrations resulting from this project will be developed into a new Plant Biology section on the nationally and internationally recognized Learn.Genetics website as online educational resources. <br/><br/>This study leverages recently developed genomic resources, stable transgenic tools, and chemically induced mutants of monkeyflowers (Mimulus) to identify and characterize transcription factors that regulate flower carotenoid pigmentation. Results from preliminary work in the PIs laboratory allows the formulation of the central hypothesis: a transcriptional regulatory complex, containing at least an R2R3-MYB and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein, directly activates carotenoid biosynthetic genes during flower development in Mimulus, and differential expression of the regulatory genes contributes to pigment pattern variation between species. In this proposed project, additional components of the transcriptional regulatory complex will be identified by bulk segregant analysis of another non-allelic mutant and by yeast two-hybrid screening using the MYB and TPR proteins as baits. The functional mechanisms of the MYB and TPR genes in the regulation of carotenoid pigmentation will be determined by protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction assays. The role of these regulatory genes in producing flower color variation will be examined by gene expression analysis and transgenic experiments in Mimulus species that display distinct carotenoid pigmentation patterns."

These attributes combined with the ability to tune the properties of these materials at the atomic scale makes them ideal for envisioned flexible nanoelectronic and ultra-high frequency applications. This project will generate fundamental knowledge of energy transport in 2D materials critical for advanced nanoelectronic device technologies. These beyond next-generation technologies have the potential to foster a revolution in computing comparable to the transition from the vacuum tube to the transistor. The outcomes of this project are likely to have a catalytic effect on the thermal engineering community as very little is known regarding the fundamental nature of a material's thermal response to elastic stimulus and mass disorder, effects which have been predicted to offer unprecedented control over intrinsic physico-chemical properties. Large changes have been predicted for thermal transport in the presence of elastic strain, and whether this should be exploited (strain enhanced devices) or prevented (strain robust devices) is a key remaining scientific question. Since no accepted technique exists in which to probe strain-effects on heat transfer mechanisms in nanomaterials, resolving this issue is a limiting challenge for the progress of nanoelectronic technologies. Furthermore, isotopic mass disorder is beginning to be understood as a tool that can be used to beneficially alter thermal transport mechanisms, thereby enabling higher power output in nanoelectronic devices. Yet understanding of the effect in low-dimensional materials is controversial, especially in light of recent phonon transport models invoking coherency effects. <br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to determine the fundamental nature of elastic strain and mass disorder on thermal transport in low-dimensional materials using technologically-critical 2D materials in order to enable their widespread adoption in flexible electronic technologies. Investigating the nature of elastic strain and mass disorder on thermal transport in low-dimensional materials using technologically-critical 2D materials in heavy, semiconducting quasi-2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) MoS2 and WS2, as well as in light, metallic truly-2D graphene, will yield insight into controversial phenomena such as divergently increasing thermal conductivity and coherent phonon transport. An innovative approach here is to develop a metrology technique using a micro-thermometry device and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to probe heat dissipation mechanisms in the presence of mechanical stimulus. This work will provide a conceptual advance in knowledge concerning the effect of mechanical stimulus and isotopic disorder on heat transfer in technologically-critical 2D materials. The outcome of this work will enable the development of new and widely applicable strain and isotopic engineering strategies to alter thermal transport processes in low-dimensional systems, in addition to solving critical questions needed for the design of flexible electronic technologies. Through this project, a new TEM-based metrology tool to quantify the elastic strain effect on the thermal conductivity of low-dimensional materials will be developed, and a Raman spectroscopic technique to probe both long-wavelength and dispersive phonons will be further developed. These new techniques will allow the effects of strain and isotopic disorder on thermal transport and phonon dispersions in 2D systems with different structural characteristics to be identified. Especially promising, the methods and outcome of this study will be generally applicable to a wide class of low-dimensional materials.<br/><br/>Furthermore, through the development of a mentor/teacher/student nucleus in nanoscale thermal transport, state-of-the-art active experimental research and educational experiences for a unique group of student researchers and pre-college educators will be implemented and evaluated. Several Ph.D. students and numerous undergraduate and pre-college students will be mentored through this project. Hands-on educational modules created through integration of this project with the NSF RET program will extend its impact into K-12 science curriculum. The proposed activities will broaden opportunities and increase accessibility of experimental nanotechnology research to underrepresented populations and the disabled in Connecticut."

The goal of this NSF CAREER proposal is to establish an interdisciplinary research-education-outreach program that rests on three legs: (i) quantitative, systems-level analysis of the mechanisms governing tissue growth and homeostasis; (ii) education of chemical engineers and bioengineers with a strong foundation in developmental biology and tissue engineering; and (iii) outreach in the local community to recruit students into science and engineering from underrepresented backgrounds. In particular, this project seeks to significantly expand our understanding of how embryos are able to correct early mistakes in specifying the relative spatial distributions of cell types during tissue formation.  A deeper understanding of cell signaling and mechanics during pattern repair can inform applications in synthetic biology, including devising ways to manipulate cellular decision-making processes in space and time.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this CAREER proposal is to build an integrated research-education-outreach program that develops and teaches systems biology approaches from an engineering perspective. In particular, this project seeks to significantly expand our understanding of how embryos are able to correct early mistakes in specifying the relative spatial distributions of cell types during tissue formation. Embryos exhibit a remarkable ability to repair patterning defects when subjected to environmental variation or genetic deficiencies. Identifying the control systems that repair tissues is important for understanding the underlying causes of birth defects as well as diseases that occur due to misregulated growth. This project will generate new imaging methods, open-source data analysis tools for multiplexed image data generated for a genetic model system of tissue pattern repair, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and simulation resources widely applicable to studies on the maintenance of tissue microenvironments. The PI's team will test the central hypothesis that embryonic pattern repair emerges from the coupling of intercellular biochemical signaling to the passive mechanical interactions between cells. This hypothesis will be tested by integrating mechanistic modeling, controlled genetic manipulations, and high-dimensional imaging to infer, or reverse engineer, the logic of pattern repair for the multiple epidermal segments that define the fruit fly's body plan along the head-tail axis. Team-based undergraduate research experiences and high school science fair projects will facilitate the creation and testing of a unified open-source application called MAPPER for analyzing multiplexed tissue data. Through collaboration with the Northern Indiana Research Science and Engineering Fair (NIRSEF) Committee, the PI will organize annual 'Science Fair Boot Camp' workshops as a new recruitment avenue for underrepresented high school students in South Bend, IN and surrounding areas. The Science Fair Boot Camp and science fair activities will serve as outreach to minority students. A Boot Camp Handbook will be distributed on the NIRSEF website as a nationally available resource."

The difference in the oxygen isotope composition (the 18O/16O ratio) of a mineral and the water from which it formed provides a temperature estimate that has a precision of ~1C. The problem with application of this method to ancient samples is that the water - usually ocean water - is not preserved in the rock and needs to be inferred. This introduces some ambiguity to the derived paleotemperature estimate. Namely, was the oxygen isotope composition of the ocean water at the time the mineral formed the same as it is today? Researchers have been tackling this question for decades, and it is still unresolved. In this proposal, the team will use a novel, previously untried, technique in which all three naturally occurring oxygen isotopes are used for temperature determinations. It has long been thought that the rare isotope 17O provides no additional information to the commonly measured 18O/16O ratios. More recently, this team and other research groups have shown that there are subtle differences in the way temperature affects the 18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios. By accurately measuring all three isotopes, 16O, 17O and 18O, it is proposed to eliminate the uncertainties inherent in using the 18O/16O ratios alone. This award will help support the graduate theses of two students, one of whom is a woman, the other a minority. It will also include research opportunities for an undergraduate student, allowing them hands-on access to sophisticated laboratory equipment. Such an opportunity is invaluable for young potential scientists. Both the investigator and the graduate students will work closely with undergraduate students recruited over the three year time frame of this project. <br/><br/>This is a new research avenue and there are many outstanding questions. As part of our research, they will calibrate the temperature dependence on the 18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios of quartz and water by experimentally equilibrating a quartz-water mixture at high temperatures and pressures. They will expand the preliminary tests of the technique to the very important mineral calcite. Marine carbonates are ubiquitous in the rock record, and if the approach works for calcite it will vastly expand the research potential of this new technique. Unfortunately, the analysis of calcite for 17O/16O ratios has proven to be very difficult. This research group will initially spend time conducting analytical tests to quantifying this measurement and reproduce it for a standard. Once the methodology is further established, they will proceed to analyze some of the most pristine, ancient samples in order to test the age-old question 'Is the oxygen isotope composition of ancient seawater the same as it is today?' At the same time, they will apply this work to high temperature systems as a way of retrieving both temperatures and fluid compositions (sources) in hydrothermal systems. This work will have important applications to the economic geology community which strives to understand how mineral deposits form."

Crowdsourcing systems have successfully leveraged the attention of millions of ""crowdsourced"" workers to tackle vexing problems. From specialized systems for crisis mapping, for protein folding, for translation to general-purpose crowdsourcing platforms. However, these positive opportunities have sinister counterparts: large-scale ""crowdturfing"", wherein masses of cheaply paid workers can be organized to spread malicious URLs in social media, formation of artificial grassroots campaigns (""astroturf""), and manipulation of search engines. As a result, crowdsourced manipulation threatens the foundations of the open web ecosystem, reducing the quality of online social media, degrading our trust in search engines, manipulating political opinion and ultimately, reducing security and trustworthiness of cyberspace. Products of the research will be available for public use. The education and outreach efforts of the project are tightly linked to the research goals through curriculum development, workshops, direct training of underrepresented women, and involvement of industry. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is it will advance the current security systems against crowdsourced manipulation in cyberspace. This project fundamentally alters the landscape of malicious task problems by detecting malicious tasks in crowdsourcing platforms. Early detection of malicious tasks has the potential to transform our solutions for secure and trustworthy information systems. Given our malicious task detection systems, identified malicious tasks can be used as samples for creating new blacklists. The blacklists have the potential to prevent propagation of malicious tasks to popular online target sites. Given our novel techniques, detecting almost all crowdturfers becomes a distinct possibility in the near future. Overall, this project will advance knowledge and understanding the crowdsourced manipulation problem, and the proposed detection framework will complement the current security systems against crowdsourced manipulation. The broader impacts of the proposed work include advances to discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning.

Understanding the time and length scales of processes in the magma plumbing system sheds light on the spatial distribution, type and frequency of volcanic eruptions and associated hazards. Although our understanding of continent-margin magmatism at depth is vastly improving, debate continues as to the dimensions, and even existence, of large magma volumes in sub-volcanic magma reservoirs, the interconnectivity between magma bodies through the thickness of the continental crust, and the importance and extent of processes that modify the chemistry of such magmas. The aim of this study is to investigate these missing, but critical pieces of the puzzle through study of plutons - ancient magmatic rocks formed at depth - as exposed in Yosemite National Park, California. Traditional bulk-rock element and isotope analyses have left too many fundamental questions about the architecture of crustal magmatic systems, resolution of which is a goal of this study through a new approach of utilizing micro-scale geochemical analysis of individual crystals in plutons. This research will also provide better data for numerical modeling efforts and has great potential to guide future studies of plutonic rocks.<br/><br/>This study will use texturally-constrained, element and isotope geochemical analysis of compositionally heterogeneous rock-forming and accessory minerals from strategically selected sites of the Tuolumne Intrusive Complex ? which was once a composite, mid-crustal arc magma reservoir - to test the following hypotheses. (1) Mineral zoning and inclusion relationships in plutonic rocks record distinct, decipherable magmatic histories. (2) Interconnected magma mush zones exist in mid-crustal reservoirs. (3) Mixing of crystal-rich magmas occurs between magmas injected from deeper levels and coexisting mush zones. (4) Crystal-liquid separation is an important process in the middle crust; consequently, many plutonic rocks are cumulate and do not represent liquid compositions. Testing these hypotheses will allow assessment of two models for mid-crustal arc plutons. A dike model predicts that magmas attain their chemical signatures in deep-crustal ?hot zones? and rise rapidly to sub-volcanic reservoirs without producing large magma bodies. A magma mush column model predicts that magmas form vertically-extensive reservoirs and undergo compositional modification at many crustal levels. Mineral analysis will allow identification of distinct mineral populations, interpretation of prevalent magmatic processes, assessment of the presence or absence of coeval magmas and their dimensions, and the ability of such magmas to chemically ?communicate?."

Bivalves build shells from calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which protect them from predators and environmental stressors and are essential for survival. Mollusks' shells, produced from precursors abundant in the seawater, have unique mechanical properties that make them superior to geological CaCO3. However, they are energetically costly to deposit and can be eroded under corrosive conditions of low salinity, high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and low pH, characteristic of estuarine waters. Recent studies show that biomineralization of marine bivalves is impaired by prolonged exposure to the moderately elevated CO2 levels (800-2000 ppm), which appears paradoxical since thriving bivalve populations are found in estuaries with a broad range of CO2 levels (400-10,000 ppm). Another recently discovered conundrum is that some mollusks with shells made of the more soluble aragonite are less affected by elevated CO2 levels than those with the shells made of less soluble calcite. These findings challenge the current paradigm in biomineralization and indicate that interactions between the environment and biological controls of biomineralization are more complex than currently recognized. To close this gap in knowledge, the investigators will determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of biomineralization in mollusks with shells made of different types of CaCO3, assess how these mechanisms are affected by seawater chemistry and identify physiological and energetic constraints on biomineralization in potentially corrosive estuarine waters. The project involves development of an interdisciplinary BioCADRE program for training of undergraduate students, training and mentorship of post-doctoral researchers, and fostering of interdisciplinary collaborations between the University of Pittsburgh and University of North Carolina at Charlotte.<br/><br/>This study focuses on the biological mechanisms of mineralization in two keystone bivalve species, Crassostrea gigas and Mercenaria mercenaria with calcitic and aragonitic shells, respectively. The PIs will test the hypotheses that hemocytes and mantle cells utilize different molecular mechanisms of mineral sequestration and transport and that species-specific differences in biomineralization mechanisms contribute to different abilities of these bivalves to build shells at low CaCO3 saturation levels. The PIs will assess how salinity and CO2 levels affect sequestration, transport and deposition of the mineral as well as expression and activity of the proteins involved in matrix formation and acid-base balance. The PIs will determine whether successful biomineralization at low CaCO3 saturation levels leads to elevated costs of basal maintenance and trade-offs between biomineralization and other energy-dependent functions. These studies will elucidate how cellular, molecular and whole-organism processes are orchestrated to support active mineral deposition in a wide range of CaCO3 saturation levels, determine what mechanisms compensate for higher mineral solubility during exposure to hypercapnia and low salinity and assess whether these mechanisms are more effective in aragonite-depositing than calcite-depositing mollusks. This project builds on previous successful collaborations between a biomineralization expert and a mollusk physiologist and has the material and intellectual resources required for its success."

Key to this question is the uncertain variation in the style and dynamics of subduction, a process when cold oceanic plates recycle into the Earth's warm interior. In this proposal, the PI plans to study the causes and consequences of flat-slab subduction (i.e., down-going plates travel sub-horizontally beneath the lithosphere before sinking into the mantle) that has found to be greatly affecting the evolution of continents. This problem has been traditionally difficult to understand due to the many complexities and unknowns involved. Fortunately, the recent progress in geophysical data acquisition and high performance computing make it possible to tackle this important geodynamic problem by building sophisticated physical models using various techniques of data assimilation. Using the PI's previous experience on constructing both forward and inverse data-oriented models (similar to how weather prediction works), the investigator will explore the subduction history in South America, North America and East Asia, where multiple flat-slab epochs have occurred, resulting in the unique geology surrounding the Pacific Ocean. Results from this project will help to better understand not only basic earth evolution but also formation of natural hazards and resources.  This project also aims at enhancing communication and education of geodynamic research to both researchers and students. By designing an online interactive geodynamics forum, the PI hopes to promote geodynamic research to the broad Earth science community, and to help interested users to learn geodynamic modeling. The PI plans to develop this geodynamics group into a community hub for doing cross-disciplinary and collaborative research. With multiple research-based flipped-classroom activities, the PI also<br/>aims to build a modern education culture, with a key focus on nurturing high quality geoscientists for the new century. Finally, this proposal will support and train two PhD students and several undergraduates.<br/><br/>It is widely accepted that subduction processes, especially flat-slab subduction, strongly influence the geological evolution of continents and mantle dynamics. However, both the causes and consequences of flat-slab subduction remain elusive. This is largely due to the difficulty to realistically simulate the complex behavior of subduction and its interaction with the overriding continents. In this proposal, the PI plan's to improve our understanding on the physical mechanisms and tectonic consequences of flat-slab subduction by combining advanced data-oriented physical models with geological and geophysical constraints. In practice, he will combine well-established subduction modeling tools (both forward and adjoint methods) with data constraints from multiple disciplines. This comprehensive modeling effort will be applied to three different geographic locations (South America, North America, and East Asia) where flat subduction occurred in the past or is still going on now, and where several different physical mechanisms for slab flattening (subduction of various buoyancy features, fast plate motions, and hydrodynamic suction from the thick overriding plate) could be evaluated. The multidisciplinary nature of this work will make the results highly relevant to many other research fields."

Many large mammals succumbed to the harsh climatic conditions of this period, while others were confined to habitable ice-free areas, or refugia. During the peak of the last Ice Age, sheets of ice divided the Old and New Worlds, restricting movement of organisms across the Bering Land Bridge for thousands of years. Geological and biological evidence have suggested, however, that refugia along the North Pacific Coast may have played crucial roles as ""stepping stones"" for movements of species between the Old and New Worlds, forming an early postglacial corridor for the recolonization of North America. Building on an unparalleled vertebrate bone collection excavated from limestone caves in Southeast (SE) Alaska, this project will perform genetic analyses and radiocarbon dating of black and brown bear specimens from throughout the last 50,000 years to directly test if these caves were occupied by bears at the peak of the last Ice Age. By ensuring precise species determinations of these keystone mammal species in SE Alaska, and providing evolutionary links to extant populations, this research will elucidate species' responses to climate change and help circumscribe the extent and timing of viable coastal refugia in SE Alaska. As such, results from this project will provide important data for a deeper comprehension of the dynamic changes in trans-Beringian biota during the Late Pleistocene, the diversity and biogeographic history of the region, and its importance as a corridor for exchange between continents during and after the last Ice Age.<br/><br/>An important outcome of this research is to recover genetic information from bear specimens that occupied SE Alaska during the late Wisconsin glaciation and into the Holocene, and provide calibrations for precise timings of demographic events. Focusing on brown bears (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus), which have developed into well-established systems for studies of Northern Hemisphere phylogeography, the project will test if the same bear populations inhabited this region continuously for the last 50,000 years, or if they were recolonized following the Last Glacial Maximum, and if they contributed to postglacial (modern) mainland populations. The project will take a highly integrative approach that leverages state-of-the-art ancient DNA analysis (including a targeted hybridization enrichment approach using custom-made biotinylated RNA baits designed from whole mitochondrial genome sequences), radiocarbon and molecular dating, reconstruction of paleodiets, and phylogenetic reconstruction. This research will have broad significance toward understanding past and present North American mammal diversity and for assessing the impact of late Pleistocene climate change on biotic diversification, colonization, and the historical biogeography of the region."

Erik Porth of the University of Alabama, under the direction of Dr. John Blitz, will use archaeological evidence to study the transformation and reorganization of a socially complex prehistoric settlement following rapid shifts in religious and political traditions in the Southeastern United States. This research will study the linkages between ritual practices and community resilience to identify how groups negotiated obligations and social relationships through local and non-local resource acquisition during a time when elaborate ceremonial and political institutions ceased and social groups emphasized a new, communally-based affiliation. Archaeology can identify how such changes occurred because it relies on physical evidence that accumulated over long time spans in the places where ritual and community practices occurred. The research contributes to a broader intellectual and social benefit by adding to an understanding of community resilience in the face of social and political change, an issue of importance in ancient and contemporary societies. It will also provide historical context for understanding how more recent processes of localized production and consumption of goods may be associated with community solidarity and identity. This project will result in scientific collaboration between institutions within the United States and the results will be presented to the public in peer-reviewed publications, online databases, and a planned museum display.<br/><br/>Erik Porth will address key anthropological issues concerning the poorly understood and under theorized relationship between social transformation, community resilience, and material remains from ceremonial activities on an earthen platform mound. The evidence needed to address the research question was excavated from ritual mound contexts at the Moundville site, a multiple-mound Mississippian ceremonial center in Alabama that was occupied from A.D. 1200 to 1520. During the fifteenth century, non-local trade, monumental construction, and elaborate ritual ended at Moundville, mirroring similar processes in Mississippian societies throughout the Deep South and Midwest. This research hypothesizes that after A.D. 1450, social relationships shifted at Moundville from individually focused practices to communal oriented activities by emphasizing locally acquired resources. Radiocarbon dates will address the timing of these proposed changes during the fifteenth century. Use of local materials will be assessed by analyzing the chemical composition and source location of the clays used to make ritually important, but stylistically non-local ceramic vessels. These techniques will determine if pottery production was occurring locally by potters from other regions who maintained their distinctive styles, or if the vessels were imported from other locations. This question is important because it points to the maintenance or disintegration of non-local connections. If potters were coming from other locations, they would have brought with them new ideas and norms that might have shaped the social transition occurring during this period. On the other hand, if pottery was being imported, this would indicate exchange relationships, and would pinpoint a different source of social influence with connected groups."

Successful treatment of CHD offers opportunities to improve quality of life for individuals afflicted with this disease with consequent benefit to society. Over 1 million adults in the USA are living with congenital heart defects. The field of engineering application in congenital heart disease has undergone an explosive growth in both application and development nationally worldwide over the past decades. The cutting edge problems that are the subject of this conference are at the interface of engineering and medicine. The 5th International Conference on Engineering Frontiers in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease brings together leading professionals in both the engineering and medical disciplines to foster collaboration between these two communities in the study of treatment of congenital diseases. The close interaction of medical doctors and engineering researchers is critical to achieving advances in the treatment of this disease and to bring engineering to bear as an aid to physicians in understanding the complex blood flow and resulting from this congenital disease, in improving and developing diagnostic tools, and in improving treatment planning. This conference aims to impact improved treatment and understanding of this age-related disease that afflicts a significant segment of the US population with the consequent improvement in patient quality of life and reduction of medical costs associated with CHD treatment. This conference also aims to expose and engage emerging researchers in a common forum to exchange the latest in developments in the field and to further establish domestic and international collaborations. These researchers will be recruited from the pool of current and recent Ph.D. graduates, Post-Docs and Fellows. The PIs will preferentially offer support to members of underrepresented groups involved in biomedical engineering research in pediatric and congenital heart disease, thus upholding the national goal of engaging underrepresented groups into the STEM disciplines. This conference as well provides successful role models for women who have established vibrant research programs and labs in this field, for instance, there are two female researcher professors on their international organizing and steering committees. The conference offers many more opportunities, invited speakers, session chairs, and panel discussions, for beginning and established female engineering and medical researchers engaged in CHD research to network at the national and international level, and thereby actively promotes recruitment of females in STEM. <br/><br/>It is vital to maintain the continuity of the International Conference on Engineering Frontiers in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease series that effectively brings together leading researchers in engineering and medicine who are engaged in cutting edge research in pediatric and congenital heart disease. The conference provides a forum to exchange of ongoing and latest breakthrough research, to expose innovative ideas, and to build research collaborations between leading researchers from across the USA and Europe.  Moreover, the conference promotes new researchers becoming engaged in the field through the Young Investigator podium speaker program and its young investigator poster competition. This series of conferences has historically attracted both USA and international participants. Specifically, through this award, NSF will support: (1) Invited Speaker Program: support travel expenses of ten (10) distinguished university faculty and medical professionals who are foremost experts in congenital heart disease to attend Frontiers 2016 and deliver invited podium presentations on their on-going research and (2) Travel of Young Investigators and Graduate Students: the PIs will support Young Investigators (4 non-UCF investigators) who will deliver podium (oral) presentations and graduate students (6 non-UCF students) to participate in Frontiers 2016. Young investigators present podium talks and PhD students participate in the poster presentation and competition. There will be a poster competition with awards for 1st-3rd place judged by a panel selected from the invited speakers.  Moreover, there will be a panel-led debate to address the pros and cons of the issue: will CFD ever reach the bedside and should it? The conference organizers have made every effort and have achieved the goal of keeping a 50/50 balance between engineering faculty and medical professionals in all invited and keynote lectures as well as panel-led debates. The PIs have also secured a special issue of the World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery to collect a series of selected papers from the invited speakers as a follow-up to the conference. The NSF funds will leverage financial sponsorship that has been secured from academic and two medical institutions in support the conference program."

These animals rely on bioluminescence for communication, feeding, and/or defense; so, the generation and detection of light is essential to their survival.  Our present knowledge of this phenomenon has been limited due to the difficulty in collecting live deep-sea animals, and the lack of proper techniques needed to study this complex system.  However, new genomic techniques are now available, and a team with extensive experience in deep-sea biology, vision, and genomics has been assembled to lead this project. This project will study three questions 1) What are the evolutionary patterns of different types of bioluminescence in deep-sea shrimp? 2) How are deep-sea organisms' eyes adapted to detect bioluminescence? 3) Can bioluminescent organs (called photophores) detect light in addition to emitting light?  Findings from this study will provide valuable insight into a complex system vital to communication, defense, camouflage, and species recognition.  This study will bring contributions to the fields of deep sea and evolutionary biology, and immediately improve our understanding of bioluminescence and light detection in the marine environment.  In addition to scientific advancement, this project will reach kindergarten through college aged students through the development and dissemination of educational tools, a series of molecular and organismal-based workshops, museum exhibits, public seminars, and biodiversity initiatives.  <br/><br/>This project combines phylogenomic, physiological, and molecular studies to test several hypotheses addressing the evolution of bioluminescence and light detection in a remarkable family of deep-sea shrimp.  All shrimp within the family Oplophoridae use a luminescent secretion discharged from the mouth to deter predators, while only some possess a second mechanism of bioluminescence in the form of photophores.  Photophores are light-emitting organs found across the body that are thought to function in counterillumination and mate attraction. These different types of bioluminescence emit light at slightly different wavelengths and spectral bandwidths.  Past studies have shown shrimp with both the secretion and photophores possess unique visual systems to distinguish between these different bioluminescence types.  However, an in-depth characterization, which combines genomic, molecular, and physiological methods, has never been applied to investigate this system.  In addition, how animals with photophores can so precisely match the downwelling irradiance has remained a long-standing mystery.   New preliminary evidence suggests that the photophores contain photopigment proteins (opsins) and other phototransduction genes that allow for light detection.  This is the first indication that autogenic light organs may also have light detection capabilities.  This raises the exciting possibility that some shrimp can ""see"" from structures other than their eyes and might provide a mechanism for their unique counterillumination abilities.  The first objective is to use phylogenomic methods to build a robust phylogeny to trace the evolutionary origins of the two bioluminescence modes (secretion and photophore) within oplophorid shrimp.  Secondly, this project will characterize the visual systems of deep-sea shrimp to better understand how shrimp distinguish between different wavelengths of emitted bioluminescence. Lastly, integrative methods will be used to examine photosensitivity in several non-bacterial (autogenic) light organs - the photophore and organs of Pesta (light organ of Sergestidae)."

Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.<br/><br/>During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments."

The event will take place on March 7, 2016, immediately preceding the 11th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2016), to be held March 8-10 in Christchurch, New Zealand, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE. HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that seeks to showcase the very best inter- and multi-disciplinary research in human-robot interaction with roots in diverse fields including social psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, robotics, organizational behavior, anthropology and many more, and to this end the conference invites broad participation. The theme of HRI 2016 is ""Natural Interaction"" which seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction. More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2016/. This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but not limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and HCI). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years. Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The PI has expressed her strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups. To further ensure diversity the event organizers will consider an applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, will recruit students who are just beginning their graduate degree programs in addition to students who are further along in their degrees, and will strive to limit the number of participants accepted from a particular institution to at most two.<br/><br/>The Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop format will encompass a variety of activities including three keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions. To start the day, all workshop attendees will briefly introduce themselves and their interests. Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants will present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session. This will enable all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting. The workshop organizers will facilitate the post-presentation discussion and will encourage participants to ask questions of their peers during the interactive break and poster session. After lunch, the remaining workshop participants will give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session. Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) will be invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants will be invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well. The conversations between the panel and participants will continue over lunch and during dinner."

However, these natural molecules often degrade at the conditions necessary for their use, such as in acidic or basic pH solutions when purifying a product or in the body where enzymes degrade the compounds before they can reach their therapeutic target. By using synthetic organic molecules to stabilize these biological materials, the agents can be engineered with both vast complexity and high stability. Furthermore, by choosing an appropriate chemical technique, high-throughput methods can be developed to rapidly select useful molecules from libraries of millions of compounds. This work will support basic research into the fundamental properties of these semi-synthetic materials and enable applied research to develop novel compounds for diverse applications. <br/><br/>This CAREER proposal will combine novel synthetic linkers, non-natural amino acid (NNAA) incorporation, and bio-orthogonal chemistry with directed evolution to engineer stabilized helices with unique targeting properties. Aim 1 of this proposal will characterize a novel series of azide-alkyne stabilized alpha helices that possess unique chemical, imaging, and pharmacokinetic properties and are compatible with cell surface directed evolution. This arrangement only requires one type of NNAA in the peptide backbone to reduce complexity and increase overall incorporation efficiency. The longer linker can be engineered with a functional handle for attachment to beads, fluorescent dyes, radiolabels, or pharmacokinetic modifiers. This modular design enables these molecules to be used in multiple applications including separations, intracellular targeting, and imaging. Aim 2 of the proposal will capitalize on the bio-orthogonal chemistry to select novel helices. A site-specific linkage is introduced to select for molecules that will retain binding while attached to the linker. This proposal will alleviate the current development bottleneck by screening millions of novel stabilized helices for new therapeutics, imaging agents, and separations components.  Engineering functionally diverse stabilized peptide and protein structures will impact several fields including the chemical industry, biomedical engineering field, pharmaceutical industry, and medical community. <br/><br/>To grow the pipeline of highly qualified and diverse engineering students to fulfill these jobs, a science-focused outreach program will be created for students from local under-resourced schools in the Detroit area. Multiple interactions with students from predominantly under-represented backgrounds facilitate hands-on activities directly related to molecular engineering research. These students will visit the University of Michigan for interactive sessions to enhance their scientific understanding and encourage them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>This CAREER award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Fertility preservation is especially challenging in female patients, because females are born with an ovarian reserve comprised of a finite number of follicles that carry immature eggs. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue prior to toxic treatments and subsequent culture of immature follicles is a promising and novel way to preserve fertility. The challenge is that follicles have low survival and maturation rates in culture, which are attributed to the complex and poorly understood signaling and interactions between the cells in a follicle. The central objective of this CAREER proposal is to discover the key signaling factors involved in the early stage development of ovarian follicles by using systems biology approach. This system will lead to the development of culture conditions for successful follicle culture to be translated to human follicles for fertility preservation, serve as a platform to screen therapeutic compounds, identify pathways with aberrant activity that could be targeted for therapy, or design environments that promote specific cellular processes in regenerative medicine and toxicology. <br/><br/>The proposed research will identify numerous transcription factors and establish their role in the growth of early-stage ovarian follicles in vitro. These fundamental studies might provide the foundation for the development of a culture system that can support the development of early stage follicles. In the bench-to-bed translation, this knowledge may be used for fertility preservation in young female cancer survivors suffering from chemotherapy-induced infertility. Our overall research objective is to: (a) establish the dynamic activity of transcription factors during early-stage follicle development in vitro; (b) identify signaling pathways that are responsible for promoting follicle survival and growth through follicle-follicle and follicle-support cells interactions; (c) determine the secretome of cultured early-stage follicles in conditions that allow follicle-follicle and follicle-stroma interactions and correlate the functional paracrine signaling factors with the activity of transcription factors (TFs) to identify the key factors and processes driving successful folliculogenesis. To achieve this objective, we will employ a systems level approach utilizing quantitative experimental characterization with multivariate analysis and modeling. Previous investigator's work has already demonstrated how optimizing biomaterial design can enhance follicle survival rates.  We will build upon this system and use the new TRACER technology (TRanscription Activity CEll aRray) to discover the identity, timing and activity pattern of TFs and secreted growth factors involved in folliculogenesis. The key transcription and secreted factors during the development of primary follicles will be investigated in vitro and compared to what is already known for in vivo development. The generated network of transcription factors predicted to be located downstream of the identified secreted factors will describe currently unknown signaling pathway active during early folliculogenesis. The broader research impact of this work will result in culture systems that can maximize ovarian follicle development and provide high quality oocytes for fertility preservation and toxicology screening. This approach has a strong potential to shed light on the mechanism of biological processes of ovarian follicle maturation, which are largely unknown and might benefit basic biologists, bioengineers, clinicians and women facing infertility altogether. The educational outreach program of this proposal integrates middle and high school students with undergraduate and graduate students to the benefit of both groups. The program will incorporate reproductive tissue engineering and biomaterials-related content and projects and will inspire K-12 students to pursue science and engineering careers through conducting K-12 outreach. The investigator is also committed to support women and minority retention in science and engineering through organizational activities and one-on-one mentoring."

The development of advanced thermoelectric materials could have a considerable impact on the nation's energy portfolio through solar thermoelectric generators, cogeneration, and waste heat recovery.  More broadly, this program will lead to a deep understanding of charge transport in complex semiconductors that impacts other applications (e.g. transparent conductors, photovoltaic materials, power electronics).

Further, the interplay between solid state chemistry and charge transport in semiconductors is particularly rich due to the profound effects that even dilute chemical perturbations exert on electronic properties.   There is thus a grand challenge to understand and control the energy dependence charge transport. In this project, the goal is to combine recent advances in structural determination and first principles calculations, in concert with single crystal growth and advanced transport measurements, to yield deep insight into charge transport through the careful integration of these measurements.   With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this understanding will reveal the energy-dependence of charge carrier transport and the associated structural perturbations which can dramatically alter these properties."

It has historically been thought to help people buffer risks. Largely, however, past work has focused on agricultural societies, with fewer studies considering how surpluses were produced and managed under other economic systems. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. William Marquardt, Victor Thompson, and Michael Savarese will conduct research at the Mound Key and Pineland archaeological sites to investigate the role of surplus production among the Calusa of southwest Florida, who were the most powerful group in peninsular Florida in the sixteenth century A.D. The Calusa king collected tribute from a population in excess of 20,000 distributed among 50 to 60 Calusa communities extending from the northern reaches of Charlotte Harbor to the Florida Keys. However, unlike the farming people of the interior river valleys of the southeastern U.S., the Calusa relied primarily on fish and shellfish for protein, collecting wild plant foods and using only a handful of plants from home gardens. Most importantly, they did not grow maize, which formed the basis of surplus production and political complexity for many groups across the Southeast. This project focuses on surplus production and distribution in a complex fisher-gatherer-hunter society. Few archaeologists have examined surplus production among fisher-gatherer-hunters, especially those in the sub-tropics. This research will shed light on long-term sustainability of fisheries, a topic of considerable world-wide interest, and address the potential impact of over-harvesting shellfish. The project will also help train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, both undergraduate and graduate students. As part of the research, the team will teach a field school that will involve students drawn from a broad geographical region. Students will be trained in research, as well as specialized methods and traditional archaeological excavation. The research will bring students with interests in archaeology, geology, and ecology together to address a burgeoning field in geoscience: conservation paleobiology (applying the theories and analytical tools of paleontology to solving problems concerning the conservation of biodiversity). The project will also partner with the Florida Public Archaeology Network as well as the Randell Research Center to engage the public throughout the research process.<br/> <br/>Specifically, by means of coring and archaeological excavations in structures thought to be fish and shellfish storage and processing features, the team will examine how the Calusa produced and managed large-scale food surpluses presumed to be necessary to sustain their large populations. This work aims to discover how surplus production was situated within the larger histories of the Calusa, and how these practices structured interactions with Europeans. This work will serve as a comparative study against examples that focus on the links between surplus, storage, social development, and the transition to agriculture and animal husbandry. Development of comparative case studies such as this one will help disengage the concepts of surplus, storage, and social relations in terms of both individual agency and collective action."

The instrument will facilitate local sampling of single cells and determination of genetic differences from cell-to-cell within a heterogeneous population. It will enhance the ability to study the genomics of stem cell development and the study of genetic mosaicism in the brain, which has important implications in understanding neurological diseases and their treatment. The project will involve students and teachers as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs in several initiatives that will advance STEM education and career development in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. The results of the project will be disseminated using an array of social media platforms that are aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of the approach broadly to the general public.<br/><br/>Genetic differences between individual cells cause differences in their biological function; however, extracting DNA and RNA from large numbers of cells obscures important information about individual cells. High performance next-generation sequencing can be performed on isolated cells, but only after they have been extracted, which loses the information about their location in the organism. This project is aimed at creating a device that can extract material from single cells while preserving its location in the tissue. The instrument uses an atomic force microscope to image the tissue and high-precision tip-enhanced laser ablation to select material for quantification and sequencing. The material is sampled with high precision from individual cells in spatially selected regions. The project goals are construction of the laser ablation system, automated imaging and sample collection, and demonstration of the instrument with breast cancer tissue samples."

Different groups of arthropods used different methods to enable breathing air, a critical requirement for life on land, a change that occurred separately in at least 7 groups.  The goal of this project is to investigate how an air-breathing respiratory system evolved separately in multiple arthropod groups.  Did evolution of aerial respiration involve alteration to the same anatomical structures and genes in each group, or does each arthropod group use a different solution to the problem of breathing air?  To resolve this question, the embryonic formation of respiratory organs in eight arthropod species will be investigated.  Genes and proteins will be tested to determine whether the same genes are used in the respiratory system of all arthropods.  Genome sequencing will further test and identify genes that create unique respiratory structures (e.g., the book lung of spiders).  The outcomes of this research will be integrated into a new laboratory-based course on invertebrate zoology, to be taught annually through the Department of Zoology, using live specimens.  A museum exhibit will be developed on the movement of arthropods onto land, and using evidence from fossils, genes, and developmental biology.  One postdoctoral fellow, one graduate student, and ten summer undergraduates will be trained during the work, emphasizing recruitment of women and underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>Investigating the parallel evolution of aerial respiration in Arthropoda has previously been limited to studies of functional morphology or expression data from a few taxa. Some developmental data suggest that mandibulate and chelicerate respiratory systems are directly homologous, whereas a separate set of data suggests that respiratory organs of arachnids arose independently from modified walking legs. Respiratory systems of Myriapoda have not been studied in a developmental genetic context at all. To resolve the origins of internalized respiratory systems of arthropods, the proposed work will examine positional, genetic, and serial homology of respiratory organs in eight emerging model arthropod systems. To establish the serial homology of arachnid respiratory organs, Hox misexpression experiments will be conducted to derepress appendages in posterior segments. To establish degree of conservation of the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying tubulogenesis across Arthropoda, gene expression assays will be performed for candidate genes known to be required for establishment of the Drosophila melanogaster tracheal tubule system. To assess functional correspondence, knockdown experiments will be conducted in two chelicerate and three mandibulate exemplars for five critical genes in the Drosphila GRN. To investigate the patterning of the arachnid book lung, comparative transcriptomic data will be generated from book lung primordia of spiders and scorpions, toward identifying a set of novel candidate genes putatively involved in book lung morphogenesis for further functional screening. This work will directly address the two competing scenarios of arthropod terrestrialization that persist in the literature, using independent tests of positional, serial, and genetic homology."

Increased intracranial pressure can result in poor health outcomes including long-term disability or death, if left untreated. However, the only available method to monitor intracranial pressure is expensive (~$10,000 per patient) and requires neurosurgery. The lack of a method to accurately screen patients to determine who needs surgery results in misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in about 46% of patients among an estimated 50,000 patients in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally. Successful commercialization of product is expected to result in savings in the range $250 million ever year to the US healthcare system.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a medical device to accurately display a patient's intracranial pressure non-invasively and for use outside of the neurocritical care unit. The core technological approach of the proposed work is the analysis of blood flow velocity waveforms using advanced signal processing methods in a machine-learning framework. The machine-learning framework allows experience-based learning utilizing prior, established databases of waveforms that have been well-characterized. Three new machine-learning paradigms that utilize the shape features of the blood flow velocity waveforms will be utilized to progressively increase accuracy of intracranial pressure estimation. The first will establish a basic estimate using shape features of individual waveform pulses, considered independent of neighboring pulses. Subsequently, clinically established features of the waveform will be utilized to learn causal changes in the shape features resulting from changes in intracranial pressure. Finally, the shape features in successive pulses will be used as a sequence to machine-learn the intracranial pressure estimate. Together, these will enable increased accuracy in estimation. All of the methods proposed in this program are entirely novel. This approach allows for real time monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement limits for ultrasonography procedures."

Exactly how different species compete with each other for this iron is poorly understood. This project uses state-of-the-art methods to evaluate whether one well established mechanism in brewer's yeast may also be operating in marine diatoms or whether these organisms use novel, previously undescribed, mechanisms for iron uptake. The collection of massive data sets on thousands of proteins will reveal proteins that are turned on in response to low iron conditions, and newly emerging genetic tools will allow us to robustly test which proteins could be directly responsible for iron uptake. This will dramatically improve the understanding of these ecologically important organisms.  More broadly speaking, this may lead to a better understanding of iron uptake in other related organisms, which include human and agricultural pathogens.  The investigators will work closely with high school students from under-represented groups and engage them in STEM activities tightly linked to the project.  Hands on experiments will be conducted to communicate the concepts of nutrient uptake, using lakes across an urban-rural gradient as the classroom.  Additional exercises will introduce students to the cutting-edge approaches that identify thousands of proteins. Select HS students will work in the investigator's laboratories. The attitudes and perceptions of these students will be evaluated to gauge the effect of the experience on their understanding of, and desire to engage in, STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>The chromalveolates, which include diatoms and haptophytes, are the most successful and biogeochemically significant eukaryotic phytoplankton in the contemporary ocean. The evidence for iron (Fe) limitation in the oceans has led to an emphasis to understand how phytoplankton compete for and acquire Fe, but this is in its adolescence (diatoms) or infancy (Phaeocystis). This work will resolve long-standing controversies regarding the mechanisms of Fe uptake in a model diatom, T. pseudonana, and the haptophyte Phaeocystis globosa. Objectives include to quantify the proteomes of these species grown under low and high Fe (with recent advances in proteomic methodology), further utilize robust emergent reverse genetics tools to evaluate the localization of key proteins and couple these approaches with kinetics to determine which proteins and redox states are important for Fe uptake. MS^E-based proteomics with ion mobility spectrometry, ideally suited for quantifying cell surface proteins, will be used. Then, for T. pseudonana, knockdown and over-expression clones will be used to confirm localization and test phenotypic responses under varied conditions. Fe uptake and Fe(II) production rates by these clones will help determine which proteins and Fe redox states are important for Fe uptake. Manipulations of gene expression for putative diatom Fe acquisition proteins will be emphasized to address specific hypotheses, but these approaches may also be adapted to take advantage of any novel proteins derived from proteomics. Full participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines will be realized at various educational levels, and the success of these efforts with HS students will be evaluated."

The hydrothermal reactor technology will be applied to the production of nanomaterials for use in water quality testing sensors. Current production of nanomaterials is dominated by batch synthesis techniques, which lack reproducibility, are often poorly scalable, and are inefficient. These limitations present a barrier to industrial production and use of nanomaterials. The continuous flow hydrothermal reactor technology can address these limitations by providing a system capable of rapid scalable production of nanomaterials with high precision, significantly reduced waste relative to conventional batch processes, reduction or elimination of harmful organic solvents, and fully integrated one-step production. <br/><br/>One of the most important resources of a healthy civilization and environment is the availability of clean water. Trace water testing represents a significant societal benefit by allowing water quality issues to be understood and correctly addressed before public health is affected. However, existing trace water quality testing typically relies on slow and expensive analysis methods, which decreases the availability of routine testing. Sensors based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) have the potential to provide a rapid and inexpensive test for trace level contaminants, making testing of potable, natural, and industrial process waters much more available. The effectiveness of these chemical sensors is critically dependent on the quality and reproducibility of the nanomaterials used in their manufacture. This project will apply the advantages of the continuous flow hydrothermal reactor technology to the manufacture of various nanomaterials for water quality testing sensors in order to increase particle quality and reproducibility, improve production efficiency (by reducing cost, waste, and synthesis time), and improve sensor performance. At the conclusion of this project, a fully integrated scalable pilot reactor system will be constructed and optimized for the production of various sensor nanomaterials. <br/><br/>This PFI : AIR TT project addresses technology gaps related to the scalable reactor design, optimized synthesis chemistry, and inline coating as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Based on industry requirements and the unique capabilities of the continuous flow hydrothermal reactor technology, the synthesis chemistry and reactor materials will be tailored to maximize the precision, quality, and size range of the product particles. Studies on the growth kinetics, reactor design criteria, and reactor construction will be conducted to determine optimal reactor design parameters for scalability and production of the particles of interest. Optimization of the online particle characterization and determination of process control parameters will occur. Finally, the inline surface modification system will be developed to complete the fully integrated reactor system and allow for single step production of sensor particles. <br/><br/>In collaboration with OndaVia Technologies, a company with expertise in water quality sensing and SERS sensor technology, nanomaterials will be incorporated into sensor cartridges for evaluation.

This proposed project will specifically look at organic compounds which comprise a major fraction of air and particulate pollution. To understand the health and climate impacts of specific emission sources, it is necessary to assign these pollutants to their sources of origin. This project will address improved measurement methods and focused laboratory studies to obtain detailed chemical composition of source-specific gases and particles as they undergo oxidative evolution in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to advance the understanding of the sources and transformation of organics emitted to the atmosphere through (1) creation of new in-situ instrumentation for chemical characterization of gases and particles, (2) controlled laboratory studies of the emissions and gas-to-particle formation pathways/potential from simple precursor vapors to realistic complex sources, (3) development of an open-access and searchable mass spectral and source profile database, and (4) integrated education and outreach activities including an academia/industry research experience program for undergraduates and direct research involvement from grade 6-12 students as part of a Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program. The current understanding of the chemicals released from natural and anthropogenic emission sources is limited, and the knowledge of the subsequent chemical transformations of these chemicals that occur while in the atmosphere is even more limited. At the conclusion of this project, metrics will be available for incorporation in model simulations and for field observation interpretation on volatility- and polarity-resolved source-specific chemical composition at the molecular and compound-class level.

New instrumentation will be produced that extends chemical characterization of these emissions across a range of volatilities (from the most volatile gases to the least volatile condensed-phase material), offering new insights on specific atmospheric transformation pathways and fates of these materials. A new academia/industry research experience program in Atmospheric Science and Technology will offer undergraduate students an opportunity to work in both settings, helping to guide their career paths through first-hand experience. This will strengthen academic/industry connections and advance the field. In addition, grade 6-12 students will play a direct role in laboratory studies through the Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program."

When DNA is passed from one organism to another in a fashion that does not involve a parent providing genetic material to its offspring, the process is called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This type of inheritance contributes significantly to human health, biotechnology, and fundamental mechanisms of evolution. For example, HGT underlies the serious problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Beneficial aspects of HGT include the ability of bacteria to detoxify pollutants. HGT also holds exciting promise for applications that enable bacteria to produce useful compounds, including fuels. This project focuses on the fate of foreign DNA after it has been transferred to a new bacterial host. A novel experimental system will facilitate investigations of HGT to improve understanding of how genetic material functions and adapts in diverse contexts. These studies will be used to develop and improve techniques that accelerate the success of biotechnology applications. The researchers have a successful history of training students at all levels and in enhancing diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific community, including training of students with disabilities. This project will be used to augment such activities. Furthermore, this project involves collaborations with researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab to develop applications in bioenergy production. Training opportunities will enable students to visit and conduct research at this national laboratory.<br/><br/>An accelerated approach to experimental evolution will be used to follow the fate of foreign genes after their insertion into the chromosome of a soil bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi. These genes will be amplified in a tandem array to enable copy number of the repeated segment (amplicon) to increase or decrease spontaneously. This process of expansion and contraction allows evolution of rudimentary control of the expression of newly acquired genes. This experimental system mimics the natural interplay between HGT and gene amplification. Gene dosage can increase a weak but beneficial function provided by foreign DNA. As mutations accrue within the amplicons, gene copies that are less fit will be lost and alleles that are more fit may increase via selection. This project exploits gene amplification to accelerate the evolutionary process so that gene divergence can be the focus of experimental study. Additional studies will alter the genetic content of the foreign DNA, changing synonymous codon usage, G+C content and chromosomal location. It will then be possible to test how these alterations affect the amelioration and retention of the genes. Strains will be grown under continuous culture in controlled environments. Copy number, mRNA, protein and DNA sequence changes will be analyzed."

Springs rich in hydrogen sulfide represent some of the most extreme freshwater environments, because hydrogen sulfide halts energy production in animal cells. Nonetheless, some fish have colonized sulfide springs throughout the Americas, and it remains unknown how they can tolerate conditions so toxic that most other organisms perish. This project will compare closely related populations that live in adjacent sulfidic or nonsulfidic habitats to identify differences in genetic, biochemical, and physiological traits that underlie tolerance to this noxious chemical. It involves the identification of genetic differences between hydrogen sulfide-tolerant and susceptible populations, particularly in genes associated with pathways affected by hydrogen sulfide toxicity or detoxification. In addition, the tolerance and the susceptibility of fish populations will be measured in the presence or absence of hydrogen sulfide. This project will yield new insights into mechanisms underlying physiological tolerance to hydrogen sulfide and the workings of animals in the presence of physiochemical stressors. Given hydrogen sulfide's role in cellular processes and disease formation, this also has implications for biomedical applications. This project provides training opportunities in integrative biology for participants at all levels of higher education.

These components include targets of H2S toxicity as well as enzymes involved in H2S detoxification. It is predicted that focal components are modulated or modified in sulfide spring populations, such that individuals have an increased ability to withstand elevated H2S concentrations, an increased ability to detoxify H2S enzymatically, and an ability to maintain or even increase mitochondrial energy production by using H2S a substrate to fuel metabolism. Furthermore, it is anticipated that modification of OXPHOS components has occurred repeatedly across independent lineages that have colonized sulfide springs. To test these predictions, this project focuses on an established model system (Poecilia mexicana) for the investigation of H2S adaptation and has three major empirical components: (1) Characterization of transcriptional and coding variation in candidate genes by use of high-throughput sequencing techniques and subsequent validation of effects on protein concentrations and structure. (2) Quantification of functional consequences of transcriptional and coding variation for H2S detoxification and bioenergetics both in vitro and in vivo. (3) Comparison of gene sequence and expression variation across a dozen independent population pairs from sulfidic and non-sulfidic habitats to test for convergence."

If this platform can deliver optics components that meet specifications, demand could reach 8-figures for a single customer, thus transforming optics manufacturing across the entire spectrum of markets that use photonics: biomedical, energy, military, and consumer. If it meets the needs of the photonics sector, this platform could penetrate a much broader commercial marketplace such as information technology, nanoelectronics and personalized low-cost consumer devices.

Due to increasing sea levels, storm intensities, and human activities, there is an imperative need to better understand coastal dynamics of flow, sediment transport, and changes in the shape of the coastline and the bottom (morphodynamics).  In the past, there have been some attempts to better understand and predict coastline evolution of sandy beach areas. However, the morphodynamic response of estuary mouths and adjacent beaches to external forces (e.g. waves, tides, river outflows) has received less attention. Nonetheless, inlets play a key role in the wide variety of ecological, economic, and social services associated with estuaries, adjacent beaches, and back-barrier lagoons. The main research goal in this project is to improve the understanding of the processes that lead to sediment movement from the up-drift to down-drift sides of inlets (bypassing). The investigator will analyze the main processes driving the shoreward movement of sand bars over the ebb-tidal delta, how the interactions between tidal and littoral currents affect the alongshore and cross-shore sediment transport, and the morphodynamic effects of infragravity waves. The project will also integrate hands-on experiences to enhance the teaching of coastal morphodynamics. Lessons and educational material will be produced targeting secondary science teachers, and graduate students will be trained and engaged in applying a constructivist approach to learning at the high school level.<br/><br/>Morphodynamics of mixed-energy inlets are still not fully understood due to the complex feedbacks between the highly temporally and spatially varying morphology, waves, tides, river flow, and mixing conditions. One of the key processes in inlet morphodynamics is sediment bypassing. It affects the sediment budget of the inlet and the sand supply to the inner bay, ebb-tidal delta, and adjacent beaches. The most accepted conceptual models of inlet bypassing could benefit from two improvements. First, swash bars over the ebb-tidal delta may not be transported onshore due, primarily, to wave swash. Rather, they should be primarily transported by surfzone currents. Additionally, littoral currents contribute to inlet bypassing not only in wave-dominated inlets, but also in mixed-energy inlets. How tidal and littoral currents interact and affect sediment transport along and across the inlet deserves additional studies. Infragravity waves might also play a primary role in inlet sediment transport processes. This project will combine in situ and remote field observations and numerical modeling at Matanzas Inlet (FL) to analyze, test and integrate these processes to improve our knowledge of sediment transport processes in mixed-energy inlets.  Findings generated from this study will help us better understand the dynamics of these coastal systems and will contribute to the improvement of coastal management tools and procedures. Research and education will be fostered through the involvement of the graduate students in the PI's research group in the educational activities. In collaboration with the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training at the University of Florida, the team will develop and implement four 5E lessons geared towards high-school students and secondary science teachers. This collaboration will provide the graduate students with the opportunity to be trained in the application of the 5E instructional method at the high-school level. A curricular module for a Summer Institute course directed towards secondary science teachers will also be developed as part of this project. The direct interaction with teachers through this collaborative initiative will promote the inclusion of key concepts of coastal morphodynamics (beach, estuaries, and inlets) into the K-12 science curriculum."

Using an array of laboratory experiments and field measurements, this research will characterize the diversity and activities of microbial communities found inside rocks in deserts around the world. This project will inform us on the diversity of robust microbes that we might expect to find when desertification takes place and help determine the recovery potential of an area after long periods of desertification.

In addition, the researchers will determine the genetic diversity and molecular adaptations of photosynthesizing organisms from these ecosystems using culturing and single-cell genomics. Results from this study will provide a comprehensive survey of the biodiversity of microorganisms inhabiting endolithic ecosystems from several continents, determine whether the local environment, (i.e. rock type and local climate) or the global environment (i.e. biogeography) strongly impact community composition, and identify molecular adaptations of phototrophs from these ecosystems and how they relate to environmental variables.

The research funded by this award would analyze the absorption data collected over the past 25 years by a network of 13 riometers located distributed across central Canada with a typical spatial separation of 500 to 2000 km between adjacent sites.  These instruments operate at 30 MHz and measure at multiple locations the signal absorption of extraterrestrial cosmic noise radiowave caused by electron production in the altitude range of 75 to 115 km (upper D- and lower E-regions).  Two sources of electron production exist in this height range: 1) photoionization and 2) impact-ionization associated with the precipitation of ions and electrons of magnetospheric origin.  The loss of the radiowave power received above the Earth's surface at any one time relative to a Quiet Day Curve (which is associated with photo-ionization) is a measure of the absorption to be associated with the precipitation of particles into this ionized region. Calibration of the riometer absorption measurements would be achieved by using measured fluxes of precipitating electrons and measured populations of trapped electrons observed in the radiation belts. This calibration would be based upon the magnetosphere detector measurements derived from tracing the positions of satellite particle energy detectors onboard the Van Allen Probes and the five THEMIS satellites using a sophisticated field-line model of the Earth's magnetic field distribution to determine the magnetospheric footprints of these satellites in situ measurements at various spatial locations across central Canada.  The process of selection of riometer absorption data for this calibration process would extract those absorption values associated with the coincidence of the footprint positions with the riometer field of view. The riometer absorption data collected would be analyzed in a statistical sense to establish possible causal relationships between the absorption signature regarding size and shape of absorption and the particular energy band responsible for the particle precipitation into the 90 km region for each riometer site. One relationship that would be searched for in this research is the development of a possible proxy for the extent of magnetospheric wave activity causing the particle precipitation. Another relationship would be the determination from the observed absorption the fractional loss of energetic electrons in the range of tens of keV to MeV energies to the upper atmosphere.  A broader impact of this award would be the enhancement of a riometer network as a useful tool with a strong potential for successful application in terrestrial and space weather forecasting. <br/><br/>Comparing riometer absorption with satellite measurements of precipitating electrons will provide for the development statistically of a relationship relating the size and shape of riometer absorption signatures with the energy spectrum of the precipitating particles.  The absorption signature results for the different riometers within the network would be used to develop maps of latitudinal and magnetic local time (MLT) distributions of precipitation. Comparison of these signatures with trapped population measurements will quantify the importance of the electron energy loss to the atmosphere, which will help understand the role of energetic electron precipitation in the global system. This study would be coincident with the declining phase of the current solar cycle and will help to demonstrate how low-cost remote sensing of ionospheric precipitation can help understand processes that directly affect the terrestrial and space weather climate."

This project tackles the engineering and design of well-defined hybrid materials, which could be applied towards effective solar energy utilization. Metal-organic crystalline materials produced by self-assembly could enable us to reach these goals and, thereby, affect the state of future energy generation and storage. This project also integrates the development of the Carolinian Women in Science (Wi-Sci) Supportive Network, which addresses the workforce demand in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The proposed Wi-Sci initiative integrates educational and research opportunities for female students in STEM disciplines by establishing intercollegiate scientific exchanges and collaborations, providing and promoting multidisciplinary research opportunities for female scientists in different research groups, and organizing educational workshops focused on attraction and retention of women in the STEM disciplines. The major goal of the Wi-Sci initiative is to create and grow a network of support at more than 60 Carolinian institutions of higher education, including 20 historically black colleges and universities, and, therefore, increase opportunities for women to occupy at least 50% of the new positions projected for STEM disciplines in the Carolinas.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Energy transfer in a predesigned pathway is an emerging field of interest for a broad scientific community and required for the development of the next generation of solar cells, photocatalysts, sensors, light-emitting diodes, and switches. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B program in the Division of Chemistry, the major goal of this project is the preparation of crystalline hybrid materials with a predesigned pathway for energy transfer that significantly enhance energy utilization efficiency and, thereby, drastically modify the existing energy and material landscape. The advantages of utilizing the proposed materials for energy transfer studies are as follows: (i) scaffold modularity, which allows tuning of photophysical properties of the material; (ii) crystallinity, which provides a platform for systematic studies of energy transfer mechanisms compared to amorphous polymers; and (iii) porosity, in combination with structural modularity, which allows studying of different energy transfer pathways involving organic linkers, metal nodes, and guest molecules. Moreover, the self-assembly approach proposed for material synthesis allows replication of the hierarchical organization of hundreds of chromophores observed in the natural photosystem. Integration of educational and research opportunities for high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students, with a special emphasis on women in STEM disciplines, is also a top priority of this project."

Exactly how different species compete with each other for this iron is poorly understood. This project uses state-of-the-art methods to evaluate whether one well established mechanism in brewer's yeast may also be operating in marine diatoms or whether these organisms use novel, previously undescribed, mechanisms for iron uptake. The collection of massive data sets on thousands of proteins will reveal proteins that are turned on in response to low iron conditions, and newly emerging genetic tools will allow us to robustly test which proteins could be directly responsible for iron uptake. This will dramatically improve the understanding of these ecologically important organisms.  More broadly speaking, this may lead to a better understanding of iron uptake in other related organisms, which include human and agricultural pathogens.  The investigators will work closely with high school students from under-represented groups and engage them in STEM activities tightly linked to the project.  Hands on experiments will be conducted to communicate the concepts of nutrient uptake, using lakes across an urban-rural gradient as the classroom.  Additional exercises will introduce students to the cutting-edge approaches that identify thousands of proteins. Select HS students will work in the investigator's laboratories. The attitudes and perceptions of these students will be evaluated to gauge the effect of the experience on their understanding of, and desire to engage in, STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>The chromalveolates, which include diatoms and haptophytes, are the most successful and biogeochemically significant eukaryotic phytoplankton in the contemporary ocean. The evidence for iron (Fe) limitation in the oceans has led to an emphasis to understand how phytoplankton compete for and acquire Fe, but this is in its adolescence (diatoms) or infancy (Phaeocystis). This work will resolve long-standing controversies regarding the mechanisms of Fe uptake in a model diatom, T. pseudonana, and the haptophyte Phaeocystis globosa. Objectives include to quantify the proteomes of these species grown under low and high Fe (with recent advances in proteomic methodology), further utilize robust emergent reverse genetics tools to evaluate the localization of key proteins and couple these approaches with kinetics to determine which proteins and redox states are important for Fe uptake. MS^E-based proteomics with ion mobility spectrometry, ideally suited for quantifying cell surface proteins, will be used. Then, for T. pseudonana, knockdown and over-expression clones will be used to confirm localization and test phenotypic responses under varied conditions. Fe uptake and Fe(II) production rates by these clones will help determine which proteins and Fe redox states are important for Fe uptake. Manipulations of gene expression for putative diatom Fe acquisition proteins will be emphasized to address specific hypotheses, but these approaches may also be adapted to take advantage of any novel proteins derived from proteomics. Full participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines will be realized at various educational levels, and the success of these efforts with HS students will be evaluated."

This project takes a entirely different approach to addressing these issues. It exploits the use of ubiquitous light as a low-cost, unobtrusive, and accurate sensing medium capable of simultaneously sensing people and their surrounding context. The proposed vision "" LightSense "" consists of off-the-shelf LED lights on the ceiling and a few low-cost photodiode sensors sprinkled in the environment. The photodiodes passively capture light blockage created by the human body and reconstruct fine-grained user behaviors in real time. LightSense leverages light to turn a space into a cognitive space, which recognizes our presence, senses our behaviors such as postures and high-level activities while monitoring our health status indicators such as levels of stress. <br/><br/>LightSense is empowered by Visible Light Communication (VLC) that turns the visible light into computational light. It contains the following novel systems and algorithmic designs: 1) a novel VLC network architecture with LED panels and sparse photodiodes to ease system deployment; 2) algorithmic and systems designs to separate light rays from dense LEDs, optimize the placement of photodiodes, and overcome the blockage of other objects (e.g., furniture, other users); 3) a new VLC primitive that allows light communication and sensing to be sustained even under extremely low light conditions; and 4) learning algorithms to infer physical activities, derive movement characteristics, and monitor psychological state. LightSense will be evaluated using real-scale testbeds and user studies. Results from this project will establish the foundational pieces to define a new research space (visible light sensing), and will generate far-reaching impact on promoting innovative interaction designs and enabling new types of precise health monitoring."

Comparisons of DNA sequences have been used to build reliable evolutionary trees for many groups of organisms. Yet in cases where species hybridize with one another (or have done so in the past), their descendants become a mosaic of genetic backgrounds, and this genetic mixing makes it more difficult to back-calculate their past relationships. Hybridization is particularly common in groups of species that have undergone rapid radiations - situations when large numbers of species evolve over a relatively short period of time - while at the same time these rapid radiations are models for many other kinds of evolutionary analysis. This project will investigate the type of genomic regions that are exchanged among species during rapid radiations. A central goal of the researchers is to develop a computer program that leverages large-scale genomic data to better understand the phylogenetic relationships among species, improving the ability to incorporate the effects of past hybridization events. This tool will be made available to the research community to help biologists understand evolution at the tips of the tree of life. The project will add interactive multimedia-based modules on phylogenetics and systematics to the highly successful All About Bird Biology website.  The project is a funded collaboratively by the NSF and the Binational Science Foundation of Israel.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to test questions about the degree and type of genomic regions exchanged among species in rapid radiations, and to explore the implications for phylogenetic inference. These objectives are based on the further development of a new bioinformatics tool (Generalized Phylogenetic Coalescent Sampler - G-PhoCS) that will allow scientists studying non-model organisms to test hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships and generate detailed demographic inferences (e.g., quantifying gene flow, effective population sizes and divergence times) across a phylogeny, using a variety of genomic-scale datasets. As empirical test cases, the researchers will leverage natural evolutionary experiments in two avian radiations in which pairs of species can be classified as either introgression-prone or introgression-resistant based on external criteria such as ecological overlap and sympatry/allopatry. The research team brings together systematists and computer scientists attempting to realize the full potential of newly emerging high throughput sequence data by developing inference methods that make use of the rich information they provide. This collaboration will more generally broaden the understanding of the patterns and processes underlying genealogical discordance among regions of the genome."

Therefore, the motivation behind the portable electrochemical detection device was to create an inexpensive chemical sensor for law enforcement agencies to reproducibly and  accurately detect multiple classes of drugs.

The conventional and portable instrumentation used for electrochemical detection is expensive, cumbersome and require special skills. The portable electrochemical detection device presented by this I-Corps team addresses the above challenges by using inexpensive sensors in a compact and portable container that is easy to use. This device is expected to impact many fields including quality control monitoring of agriculture produce and fine chemical products and intermediates.<br/><br/>The electrochemical device presented here utilizes a paper-based electrode with carefully engineered channels to allow separation of the suspected drug from the matrix. The drug migrates along laminar flow in the channels based on their physical properties until it reaches the detection area of the electrode. The detection area has three conductive-ink/paste-based electrodes that are used for the amperometric measurement of the drug. The I-Corp team intends to perform a product-market analysis for the commercialization potential of the portable electrochemical detection device. Direct conversations with prospective customers will allow for greater understanding of each industrial sector?s pain points for routine chemical analysis outside of the laboratory. Participation will also help the I-Corp team clarify the direction the technology can take going forward such as product development issues to meet identified specific market needs."

To achieve this goal, the PI proposed an educational program that trains next generation engineers to work in collaborative teams of experts, preserving academic rigor in each discipline while simultaneously attaining the broad goals of the technical and environmental design requirements. This is an ideal platform to demonstrate that co-optimization of environmental and performance objectives will not slow progress to market, but instead supply a novel toolset that can provide transformative advances and accelerate discovery.<br/><br/>Novel advanced materials are required to meet several of the NAE Grand Challenges. Carbon nanotubes are particularly well-suited to address two of the primary environmental engineering directives of water access and viable renewable energy. To enable these important applications, the principle investigator (PI) proposes a research program to surmount limitations in carbon nanotube manufacture via: (1) uncovering the chemical mechanisms associated with carbon-carbon bond building during carbon nanotube synthesis, (2) leveraging this mechanistic understanding to exert precision control on nanotube morphology and bond placement, enhancing the atom economy while minimizing unwanted byproduct formation, and, (3) as a consequence, maximizing the material performance while minimizing the environmental impacts at a reduced fabrication cost for a sustained benefit to the national economy. If successful, the proposed work will contribute a fundamental understanding to the fields of heterogeneous catalysis and nanofabrication and unlock the unattained, transformative materials needed to address the world's water, climate, and energy storage needs. Last, because of the intellectual value of the demonstrated simultaneous-optimization platform for all future technologies, this work could have far-reaching and unimagined benefits in the engineering innovation space. Using a novel Mango Tango chemistry/reactor system, the PI proposes that the carbon precursor controls the reaction product, allowing one to tailor the chirality of SWCNT as well as the surface chemistry.  This will allow the production of surfaces that can be used in a variety of applications. In this system, the carbon nanotubes are generated on a fixed substrate rather than in a flowing gas reactor. By using alkynes with different side R groups, the PI can produce a variety of different surface chemistries and dictate the chirality of the product. Student colloquia will address a critical gap in professional preparation trainings and in public communication skills for engineering students."

The institution will develop two new courses to prepare the scholars to break down silos between science and mathematics and to better prepare their secondary students to understand knowledge transfer between settings. This will particularly benefit students in multicultural and high-need classrooms who need multiple perspectives and reinforcement to improve both mathematics and science skills. Additional foci of these courses will be on teaching project-based inquiry learning and grounding instruction in relevant, community-based applications. Participation in STEM research with peer support will improve the scholars' understanding of science and mathematics practices and their ability to communicate and teach inquiry-based activities, and service learning will promote community engagement. A long-term mentoring relationship and additional professional identity development will cement the scholars' self-confidence and help them persist in a challenging position.

Li-ion cells offer excellent energy density and electrochemical performance in multiple applications, including electric vehicles. However, overheating due to poor thermal conduction is a well-known technological barrier, which directly impedes performance and results in severe safety concerns, as shown in recent incidents of fire in aircraft and car battery packs. There is an urgent need to identify and alleviate the fundamental material-level root cause of poor thermal behavior of Li-ion cells. This can potentially transform Li-ion cell performance and safety, but is also particularly challenging due to the highly coupled nature of thermal and electrochemical transport in a Li-ion cell over multiple length scales, and due to the importance of preserving electrochemical performance while improving thermal transport. This work will lay the foundation of microscale thermal engineering of electrochemical energy storage materials for current and future devices. Experimental and theoretical research methods developed in this work will be applicable to several other related engineering systems, such as super-capacitors. Education and outreach initiatives will address learning challenges among undergraduate students, particularly non-traditional ""commuter"" students and those from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses scientifically and technologically relevant problems related to poor thermal transport in Li-ion cells, which is a major impediment to performance and safety.

This interdisciplinary research will, for the first time, measure and enhance thermal transport in materials and material interfaces in Li-metal and solid state electrochemical devices through interfacial chemical bridging and microstructural changes. These research thrusts will quantify the nature of microstructure-property-function relationships for key Li-ion materials. Improved cell-level thermal performance due to thermal enhancement of rate-limiting processes will directly result in safe and high performance batteries that will transform the nature of energy conversion, transportation and electronics through applications that are simply not possible with present batteries."

Helical piles are deep foundation elements that look like, and are installed like, a large steel soil screw - they have a slender steel shaft with any number of round plates at the tip to provide support to the structure they hold.  Helical piles are spun into the ground with a large torque motor and provide support through soil bearing on the plates and along the shaft.  They come in many lengths and are often the foundation of choice for retrofitting existing buildings or new, urban construction, due to their small footprint and ability to create minimal disturbance to surrounding structures.  Although helical piles are installed as foundation elements in seismically active areas such as New Zealand and Japan, they have not been used widely in seismically active areas of the United States. This lack of use is, admittedly, due to having no quantifiable data to illustrate the seismic behavior of helical piles. In addition, there are no side-by-side seismic comparisons to other deep foundation systems available, other than qualitative ""survival"" stories like those from the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.  <br/><br/>After the series of earthquakes in 2011, the city of Christchurch was surveyed and it was found that all buildings/infrastructure constructed on helical piles sustained minimal structural damage, however, a large majority of the condemned buildings were constructed on other foundation types.  The international community has qualitative proof that helical piles perform well in earthquake prone areas, but engineers have not quantified ""why"" those piles are superior foundation elements, and unfortunately, helical pile use in seismically active areas within the United States remains minimal.  Therefore, this project seeks to find out ""why"" helical piles seem to behave so well in seismic regions by subjecting them to earthquake loads in the University of California - San Diego's Large Shake Table.  These data are especially important and timely to generate because certain areas of the United States are now requiring seismic retrofits of existing buildings, yet engineers have a dearth of data regarding foundation systems to help make these structures safer. For example, in October 2015, the City of Los Angeles voted on a seismic ordinance that will require more than 13,000 structures, both pre-stressed concrete and soft-story wood structures, to be seismically retrofitted. Even though it is known from qualitative studies (e.g., New Zealand and Japan) that piles with comparatively small cross-section and high anchoring capacity, such as helical piles, are beneficial for seismic resistance seemingly due to their slenderness, higher damping ratios, ductility, and resistance to tip uplift, building codes and current state of practice have not been adequately developed for this pile type because no quantitative data exist. Research of seismic behavior of helical pile supported structures is therefore imperative to generate necessary data that will help ensure that helical piles are being correctly applied in seismic areas and establish quantifiable benefits and/or limitations of helical pile use in seismic areas.  This project will benefit people living in seismic zones by educating engineers with full-scale helical pile experimental data so that they better understand how to design a building system that is safer, more resilient and sustainable for individuals and the community."

However, non-strike slip motion associated with these large faults is often accommodated on secondary faults, which may also be the source of large earthquakes as demonstrated in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The tectonic conditions that cause slip along these secondary faults are not fully understood. This project uses a combination of physical and computer modeling experiments to better understand why slip takes place on these secondary faults rather than the main fault. The proposed research advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and persons with disabilities in STEM through support of a hearing-impaired female PI and a female graduate student; (2) continued mentoring of deaf and hearing-impaired students; (3) improved STEM education through posting of animations from analog experiments on YouTube and web cam broadcast of experiments Google+ Hangouts transmissions; (4) development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through graduate student training; and (5) a better understanding of earthquake hazards along fault systems such as the San Andreas Fault.<br/><br/>This project uses physical and numerical experiments to investigate slip partitioning along strike-slip systems within two types of settings, oblique plate motion and restraining bends. Both of these settings are observed to have slip partitioned faults with strike-slip along vertical fault strands and oblique slip along dipping fault strands, but the loading differs between the models. The physical experiments will test the conditions under which strike-slip faults develop outward verging secondary faults. The experiments explore the controls on and thresholds for slip partitioning and will quantify the nature of slip partitioning within these systems. The analog models utilize wet kaolin to simulate a range of oblique strike-slip boundary conditions that explore the conditions for secondary contractional fault development. The physical experiments data include measurements of the evolving horizontal displacement field using digital image correlation, changes in uplift patterns using stereo imaging, measurements of dilational stress using pressure transducers and estimates of relative water flux along faults using an infrared camera. The data from the analog experiments will be used to track the evolution of kinematic efficiency to test if slip partitioned systems accommodate oblique convergence more efficiently than non-partitioned systems. Numerical simulations of the experiments will assess the work budget of the slip partitioned systems and test if the fault systems evolve to minimize work. 3D numerical simulations of the various experimental setups will provide complete stress and strain fields that facilitate calculation of the complete work budget within the system. This will provide insights, for example, on the tradeoffs between work against gravity and internal deformation as the fault system evolves. The combined physical and numerical investigations in this proposed study will provide a critical bridge between theories of slip partitioning under oblique strike-slip and geologic and experimental observations."

This CAREER research proposes an innovative, twofold approach to urban watershed management. The approach is predicated on improved landscape modeling at both the site and watershed scales, and the use of geospatial techniques to target and treat those areas that contribute most to surface water degradation. The nature of the proposed approach integrates sensor technology, geospatial tools, and modeling to inform the design and optimization of the placement of green infrastructure in urban systems.<br/><br/>As healthy waterways are increasingly valued, and the degradation of these waterways by urban stormwater runoff is better understood.  Major efforts are underway to restore watershed function across the United States. With these efforts largely relying on coarse runoff models and empirical approaches for green infrastructure implementation, there is a dire need for improved approaches to watershed restoration. Watershed restoration efforts are often undertaken without an understanding of potential impacts. The central hypothesis in this CAREER proposal is that impervious areas within urban watersheds differ in their contribution to stormwater generation and transport based on their spatial configuration. Thus, restoration approaches that target the most impactful impervious areas will result in optimized environmental outcomes. The research topic will address deficiencies that seriously limiti the effectiveness of stormwater control measure strategies that can manage stormwater and mitigate the impact on watersheds. Specific objectives are to: (1) use sensor technology to characterize bioretention cell function and inform improvement and parameterization of a site scale model, (2) couple site scale and watershed scale models to better understand cumulative green infrastructure effects, (3) use a globally unique experimental watershed to test the coupled model, (4) compare opportunistic green infrastructure site selection to geospatially informed approaches using the same experimental watershed, and, (5) integrate outcomes into a long lasting educational plan spanning multiple target groups. Through an integrated research and teaching program, the principle investigator (PI) will become a leading contributor to sustainable urban water management in the United States and globally.  The improved landscape modeling and placement methodology are transformative because they establish a scientific understanding of the factors controlling the efficacy of stormwater control measures at different geospatial scales. These will form the basis for elevating their implementation to a rational engineering approach in optimized locations. The coupled model will allow scenario development and testing prior to implementation, facilitating optimization of approaches and realistic expectations. As green infrastructure increasingly becomes a core component of watershed restoration approaches, optimizing its placement to achieve maximum outcomes is critical. For example, estimates of implementing stormwater improvements to reduce nutrients in the Chesapeake Bay alone are in the billions. These efforts can be maximized by allowing scenario development and testing prior to implementation. The research program presented herein will integrate with the PI's long-term educational objective of increasing the understanding of watershed hydrologic and water quality processes at multiple levels of targeted groups, from K-12 to the general public, specifically targeting underrepresented individuals. The PI proposes creating a bioretention facility at a local high school through the USFS grant for educational purposes to track tree growth as a function of design configurations. This will be a good learning environment for the University of Tennessee undergrad and grad students. Outreach to 4-5 high schools that have or will have bioretention facilities is impressive. These will be equipped with pressure transducers, soil moisture sensors, rain gages, and climate sensor arrays. Teachers will be educated on the use of the sensors and aided in the development of lessons plans that integrate the sensors into lessons on developing graphics, statistics, and other learning goals."

These animals rely on bioluminescence for communication, feeding, and/or defense; so, the generation and detection of light is essential to their survival.  Our present knowledge of this phenomenon has been limited due to the difficulty in collecting live deep-sea animals, and the lack of proper techniques needed to study this complex system.  However, new genomic techniques are now available, and a team with extensive experience in deep-sea biology, vision, and genomics has been assembled to lead this project. This project will study three questions 1) What are the evolutionary patterns of different types of bioluminescence in deep-sea shrimp? 2) How are deep-sea organisms' eyes adapted to detect bioluminescence? 3) Can bioluminescent organs (called photophores) detect light in addition to emitting light?  Findings from this study will provide valuable insight into a complex system vital to communication, defense, camouflage, and species recognition.  This study will bring contributions to the fields of deep sea and evolutionary biology, and immediately improve our understanding of bioluminescence and light detection in the marine environment.  In addition to scientific advancement, this project will reach kindergarten through college aged students through the development and dissemination of educational tools, a series of molecular and organismal-based workshops, museum exhibits, public seminars, and biodiversity initiatives.  <br/><br/>This project combines phylogenomic, physiological, and molecular studies to test several hypotheses addressing the evolution of bioluminescence and light detection in a remarkable family of deep-sea shrimp.  All shrimp within the family Oplophoridae use a luminescent secretion discharged from the mouth to deter predators, while only some possess a second mechanism of bioluminescence in the form of photophores.  Photophores are light-emitting organs found across the body that are thought to function in counterillumination and mate attraction. These different types of bioluminescence emit light at slightly different wavelengths and spectral bandwidths.  Past studies have shown shrimp with both the secretion and photophores possess unique visual systems to distinguish between these different bioluminescence types.  However, an in-depth characterization, which combines genomic, molecular, and physiological methods, has never been applied to investigate this system.  In addition, how animals with photophores can so precisely match the downwelling irradiance has remained a long-standing mystery.   New preliminary evidence suggests that the photophores contain photopigment proteins (opsins) and other phototransduction genes that allow for light detection.  This is the first indication that autogenic light organs may also have light detection capabilities.  This raises the exciting possibility that some shrimp can ""see"" from structures other than their eyes and might provide a mechanism for their unique counterillumination abilities.  The first objective is to use phylogenomic methods to build a robust phylogeny to trace the evolutionary origins of the two bioluminescence modes (secretion and photophore) within oplophorid shrimp.  Secondly, this project will characterize the visual systems of deep-sea shrimp to better understand how shrimp distinguish between different wavelengths of emitted bioluminescence. Lastly, integrative methods will be used to examine photosensitivity in several non-bacterial (autogenic) light organs - the photophore and organs of Pesta (light organ of Sergestidae)."

A chemical in the brain called dopamine is well known to promote advantageous behavior when animals are pursuing reward; however, little is known regarding the role of dopamine when animals are avoiding harm. The principal investigator's lab is able to measure real-time dopamine levels in the brain of behaving animals using a tool called voltammetry, and turn dopamine neurons on/off using a tool called optogenetics. Using these tools, the investigator's research team will perform a thorough assessment of how dopamine levels within the brains of behaving rats are involved in the avoidance of footshock. Additional experiments serve to determine whether dopamine is involved in assessing the value of avoiding different intensities of footshock. It is predicted that dopamine levels will change over the course of learning in a manner that promotes successful footshock avoidance and scale with the value of the footshock avoided. All aspects of the proposed project will involve undergraduate trainees, especially trainees from underrepresented populations. By using cutting-edge technologies to investigate the role of dopamine in the avoidance of harm, the principal investigator and his students will uncover novel information about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavior while simultaneously developing a future, diverse population of scientists.<br/><br/>The principal investigator recently demonstrated that a warning signal predicting the avoidance of an aversive event evokes transient surges in dopamine concentration within the ventral striatum. This finding suggests that the transient dopamine signal represents environmental stimuli predicting the avoidance of something bad similarly to those predicting the receipt of something good. Furthermore, preliminary optogenetics data reveal that facilitating midbrain dopamine neural activity during warning signal presentation promotes avoidance outcomes in well-trained rats. Despite these important advances, the precise role(s) that transient dopamine release events play in negative reinforcement processes remains unknown. In this project, the investigator and his research team will use fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and optogenetics to assess the role of transient dopamine release events in the nucleus accumbens core, dorsomedial striatum, and dorsolateral striatum during: 1) avoidance learning, 2) maintenance and extinction of avoidance, and 3) positive vs. negative reinforcement value assessment. The collection of these data will generate presently unknown mechanistic detail regarding how the brain processes negative reinforcement-- information that may contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of dopamine in animal behavior. To accomplish these goals, the investigator will involve undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, in all aspects of data collection and dissemination. In addition, the investigator will develop an international neuroscience conference experience program for undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities and a neuroscience outreach program in which undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities visit Denver city museums and schools to teach the general public about the brain."

Recent studies have shown that many animals, from butterflies to chimpanzees, can protect themselves against parasites through self-medication (the use of anti-parasitic substances or diets). However, the mechanisms by which medication behaviors reduce parasite infection and disease remain poorly understood. This project focuses on monarch butterflies and their protozoan parasites. Monarch caterpillars are specialist feeders on milkweed plants, and milkweeds vary in their concentrations and toxicity of chemicals called cardenolides. When feeding on toxic milkweed, monarchs become less sick, and infected female butterflies preferentially lay their eggs on toxic milkweed to reduce disease in their offspring. This project will determine whether toxic milkweeds reduce disease by directly killing parasites, by increasing the immune response of monarchs, or by providing monarchs with a gut flora that prevents parasite infection. Beyond monarch butterflies, this project has broad relevance to other animals, many of which use medicinal plants. The parasites studied here are related to parasites causing disease in agricultural animals and humans, thus elucidating the anti-parasitic activity of milkweed chemicals could have future applications for treating disease. The project will also integrate research with education, by training graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups in science. The researchers will also develop lesson modules with the Wylde Center, an Atlanta-based non-profit organization that teaches environmental awareness through community-garden based outdoor programs. As part of this, the project will directly contribute to the science education of thousands of K-12 students. <br/><br/>Hosts have evolved a range of defenses against their parasites, including behavioral and microbial defenses. Such defenses may have important consequences for the evolution of physiological immunity, but research on the interplay between physiological immunity, behavioral immunity and microbial protection remains scarce. This project will study the interaction between monarch butterflies, their milkweed host plants and their protozoan parasites to address three hypotheses: (1) behavioral use of medicinal milkweeds directly decreases parasite infection, rendering physiological immunity superfluous and reducing investment in such immune mechanisms; (2) medicinal milkweeds do not reduce monarch immunity but instead exert their protective effects by enhancing physiological immune responses; and (3) medicinal milkweeds modulate monarch midgut microbiota to a state that confers resistance to parasite infection. These hypotheses will be addressed by elucidating immune responses differentially mounted upon infection of butterflies from resistant and susceptible populations, comparing anti-parasite immune responses in monarchs fed on medicinal and non-medicinal milkweed plants, and by analyzing the effects of milkweed secondary and nutritional chemicals on monarch immunity and resistance. In addition, comparison of the midgut microbiota of monarchs reared on medicinal and non-medicinal milkweeds will be coupled with experiments manipulating gut microbiota to test for the effect of medicinal milkweed microbial communities on monarch resistance to infection. The researchers will use a combination of fieldwork, controlled experiments and next generation sequencing technology, including the use of RNASeq to quantify differential immune responses and MiSeq to quantify bacterial and fungal caterpillar gut communities."

Despite significant investments to develop new therapeutics, cancer treatment has only marginally improved primarily due to the small number of new anti-cancer drugs made available for chemotherapy treatment of patients. A major reason behind this problem is the high rate of failure of candidate drugs in the process of drug discovery. During this process, pharmaceutical industries use two-dimensional (2D) cultures of cancer cells to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of candidate drug compounds. However, cancer cells grown as a 2D layer poorly represent human tumors that comprise of three dimensional (3D) mass of cancer cells. This disparity causes major differences in biological properties of cells and their responses to drugs. As a result, the same drug that is effective against 2D culture of cancer cells fails to show efficacy in patients. To overcome this major and long-standing problem, this Innovation Corps (I-Corps)team has developed a new technology that will allow culture of cancer cells in 3D and produce tumor-like tissues known as tumor spheroids. Incorporation of this technology in the process of drug discovery will help predict efficacy of candidate drug compounds and only move forward those compounds that produce a desired effect against tumor spheroids. This will substantially reduce ineffective compounds from further consideration, expedite introducing new drugs to market, and significantly reduce associated costs. Availability of a larger number of effective drugs at a lower cost will improve chemotherapy of patients and reduce healthcare costs.<br/><br/>Considering the current unmet need of pharmaceutical industries for a robotic, high throughput 3D cancer cell culture technology for use in the process of drug discovery, the proposed tumor spheroid technology fills this major gap by offering an enabling tool to screen libraries of chemical compounds against realistic tumor models and expedite the discovery of novel, effective oncology drugs. Considering the market size for oncology drug discovery, this technology can be used on a contractual basis to offer screening of libraries of compounds for pharmaceutical customers. Alternatively, the technology can be licensed to such customers to facilitate their in-house drug screening."

The quantum mechanical nature of atoms and electrons governs the behavior of materials at microscopic length- and time scales, but at large scales a fully atomistic approach is intractable. Computer simulations that bridge different length scales carry the promise of bringing fundamental research closer to manufacturing: New materials and technological applications could be developed faster and cheaper. That is particularly true for optical materials that are, for instance, needed for photovoltaic devices and energy production, displays, and novel efficient sensors for biological and medical applications.<br/><br/>In this project, the research team seeks to develop an approach for computational design and discovery of optical materials across multiple length scales. The researchers will improve approximations that are used to achieve a quantum mechanical description of optical absorption. This in turn will enable the team to successfully describe materials with strong interactions between electrons and ions, a subject of intense current interest. Based on the results of these predictive simulations, the team will abandon the atomistic resolution of the model in order to simulate optical materials that are structured at nanoscale dimensions. The team will incorporate data from recently developed public online databases into the computational framework aiming to discover new candidate materials and investigate their suitability for modern optical applications. The input and output research data sets will be made publicly available for advanced verification and validation, and possibly unforeseen uses, e.g. in data-mining.<br/><br/>While the broader availability of supercomputers transforms how modern research is done, skilled, interdisciplinary researchers are becoming an essential component. For that reason, the research project is tightly integrated with educational activities to train the next-generation workforce at the nexus of materials and computer science. The PI will incorporate computer simulations into the undergraduate curriculum at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and develop computational learning modules that can be directly used in the classroom. The PI will also build an interdisciplinary team of undergraduate researchers to develop virtual-reality-based techniques for education and exciting outreach to a large audience, which includes high school and undergraduate students. This will be achieved by new techniques for interactive visualization of simulation results in three dimensions using a smartphone. All codes and implementations developed for research, the computational modules for education, and the virtual-reality apps for education and outreach in high schools will be documented and made accessible to the broader research and education community.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports research and education in the development of a computational materials science framework with predictive power across multiple length scales. The framework will enable the research team to accurately describe optical properties and allow for computer-aided design and discovery of novel optical materials. The researchers will extend presently used first-principles quantum-mechanical techniques to overcome limitations that lead to large uncertainties for optical absorption spectra, and especially for excitonic effects in polar materials. They will achieve multiscale predictions for nanostructured materials by solving Maxwell equations, and they will develop approaches to screen online data repositories for excited-state properties. This framework will allow the design and discovery of novel optical materials, entirely based on computer simulations.<br/><br/>To achieve the goals of this project, the research team will develop detailed understanding of complicated electron-electron and electron-ion interactions based on parameter-free quantum-mechanical simulations. They will improve the description of dielectric screening by accounting for contributions from free carriers and the lattice, overcoming uncertainties for novel polar materials. Using these results in Maxwell-equation-based modeling of nanostructured materials eliminates the dependence on input from experiment, and extends the atomistic first-principles simulations into the nanoscale regime. The team will use existing data from large density-functional theory based online databases to learn about excited-state properties, and to facilitate the discovery of new optical materials within tens of thousands of available datasets. This project will develop generally applicable techniques and use them to understand polar materials with desirable characteristics, e.g. for plasmonic applications.<br/><br/>While the broader availability of supercomputers transforms how modern research is done, skilled, interdisciplinary researchers are becoming an essential component.

The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2016 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, to be held in San Francisco, CA, on February 27-March 2, and sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). The CSCW conferences are a premier venue for the presentation of research relating to the research, design and practice of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities and networks (including collaborative systems and social computing), and are attended by approximately 500 professionals from around the world, top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are interested in both the technical and social aspects of collaboration. The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for the conference, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of social activities. CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations. CSCW 2016 will be the 19th conference in the series. Research reports published in the CSCW Conference Proceedings are heavily refereed and widely cited. More information about the conference may be found online at http://cscw.acm.org/2016/index.php.  The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia. These doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them both to sharpen the research skills and to create a social network among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Maintaining and fostering research dialog among the diverse disciplines that are present in the CSCW community results in synergistic and transformative research collaborations. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Colloquium at CSCW 2016 will be a full-day event taking place on Sunday, February 29, preceded by an opening dinner and welcome activities the evening before.  Follow-up activities (including poster sessions) will take place during the conference's main technical program. Goals of the doctoral consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants, who are chosen by a review committee based on materials submitted by applicants in response to the CSCW Call for Participation, will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. The students' presentations will be published in the CSCW Extended Abstracts, which are available to all conference attendees. The organizing committee will take proactive steps to ensure and increase participation from institutions and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented at CSCW."

At the same time, forest cover over the region has increased dramatically, driven by abandonment of poor quality agricultural lands.  This project will test the hypothesis that reforestation in the eastern U.S. provides the explanation, in that it affects the surface energy balance in ways that lead to cooling and thus obscures long-term warming from climate change.  Just as human bodies are cooled by sweating or by a fan, forests may be cooled by greater rates of evapotranspiration and wind-driven movement of heat energy when compared to the croplands and grasslands they have replaced.  Looking forward, the rate of reforestation will decline over time as available space is filled, but the types of trees that fill in naturally or are planted will likely change.  Notably, drought-tolerant oaks are currently declining, while drought-sensitive maples and pines are proliferating.  So this work will also test a second hypothesis that ongoing regional shifts in tree species promote a reduction in evapotranspiration, particularly during periods of drought, that will tend to warm the surface.  The research will inform the development of sustainable agro-ecosystem management strategies that mitigate damaging effects of drought on ecosystem productivity and function.  A series of workshops will be developed, along with a citizen science program aimed at training young scientists in effective approaches for leveraging and analyzing network data.<br/><br/>The research will be enabled by interactions with a range of environmental observation networks, which aggregate meteorological and ecological observations from many ecosystems and thereby enable a big data approach to environmental science. Project outcomes are relevant to ongoing modelling efforts to reproduce historic climate trends and predict future conditions with more confidence. This work will advance network-driven environmental science by generating a rich collection of leaf- to ecosystem scale observations that will be shared with existing networks. The research is motivated by the recognition that, within the study region, ongoing management activities are driving a transition from forests dominated by species that are more anisohydric in their water use to forests dominated by more isohydric species. The concept of isohydry has received much attention in recent years, and this project will advance this body of knowledge by classifying important eastern U.S. species along the isohydric-anisohydric continuum, and developing a model for stomatal conductance that incorporates the isohydric-anisohydric framework.  While this project is focused on ecosystem energy balance, the project outcomes will also be relevant for efforts to understand regional carbon and water cycling, and for the development of forest management strategies that mitigate deleterious effects of drought on ecosystem functioning"

While high-latitude climates show the largest temperature changes, tropical forests take up and sequester forty percent of the anthropogenic and natural carbon exchanged with the atmosphere. Soils in these forests are the largest pool of terrestrial carbon. Under high water, low oxygen conditions, decomposition results in the production and release of methane gas (CH4)by microorganisms known as methanogens. During dry seasons, deeper rainforest soils remain wet, but dry at the surface. When that happens, a different group of microorganisms consume the methane and convert it to carbon dioxide. Methane gas has a ten to one hundred-fold greater greenhouse warming effect compared to that of carbon dioxide (CO2). Consequently, the relative release of these two gases in tropical rainforests has a large impact on the warming of climate. An unusually strong El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event is beginning to impact North America in 2015 and 2016. It is predicted that this ENSO will result in a major drought in tropical forests of Central America. Given the governing role of precipitation in soil carbon cycle, the impact of the drought from the developing ENSO is likely to be substantial. This RAPID project will test the idea that the ENSO cycle controls much of the year-to-year variability in the global carbon dioxide and methane cycle, by turning tropical forest soils from a strong source for methane during the normal rainy season, to a year-round sink for methane and source of carbon dioxide during El Nio-induced drought events.<br/><br/>Soil carbon dynamics have been measured through imaging of root and microbial production and turnover, and direct measurements of CO2 production and efflux. However, even with detailed measurements of outputs, the carbon budget developed for the Costa Rican rain forest near La Selva Biologcial Station fails to account for nearly ten percent of the total fixed C. One potential missing component in these measurements is methane (CH4). Tropical forests are both consumers and producers of CH4. During normal wet years, increased activity of methanogens relative to methanotrophs in anoxic, wet soil conditions results in methane release. Then as soils dry between storms, methanotrophs may dramatically increase rates of methane oxidation, resulting in the release of higher amounts of respired soil CO2. An unusually strong 2015-16 ENSO event has been detected in North America. ENSO-associated drought in tropical forests of Central America are likely to be extreme at the La Selva site. Specifically, it is hypothesized that: (1) large amounts of CO2 produced underground during normal, wet rainy seasons are converted to CH4, which is eventually released to the atmosphere; (2) the anaerobic soil conditions of wet rainy seasons cause even greater CH4 release through methanogenesis coupled to decomposition, and (3 during a strong El Nio event, drier conditions will result in an increase in methane oxidation by methanotrophs in these soils. To test these questions, CO2 and CH4 will be continuously measured, through the pre-ENSO, ENSO, and post-ENSO climate conditions. qPCR and RT-qPCR will be used to quantify the abundance and activity of both methane-producing (methanogens) and -consuming (methanotrophs) microorganisms. These measures will be coupled with root, understory and litter surveys to compare living and dead plant biomass that contributes the C to these microbes."

The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) as host institution is responsible for meeting organization, including logistics, meeting rooms and related needs. Funds from this grant support activities associated in particular with efforts by the research community, in collaboration with stakeholder organizations and government agencies, to define and implement a coordinated Arctic observing system. Support is primarily directed to the various components of the ASSW and AOS during the meetings themselves, and will include support for some key attendees. <br/><br/>This award supports a process by which broader input from the research community and stakeholders on key aspects of defining and implementing an Arctic observing system is gathered, synthesized and reframed in terms of specific recommendations and action items. The latter input is then collectively discussed and refined by participants to generate an action plan and specific agenda that will be taken up by organizations active in the Arctic and/or represented at the summit. The advantage of hosting a single large event where a large fraction of all Arctic-relevant organizations meet and interact is to improve communications, enhance planning, and efficiently coordinate collaborations. These benefits create the foundation to advance and evaluate new ideas and research agendas as well as promoting discovery and transformational science. Each of the groups associated with ASSW will meet to accomplish their own goals, and this award will help provide the environment for them to effectively accomplish that."

In nature diamond nanocrystals are formed through non-equilibrium events including stellar supernovae or the impact of meteors on Earth.  More recently, diamond nanocrystals have been synthesized directly within laboratories through the detonation of high explosives (i.e., TNT), pulsed laser irradiation of carbon nanoparticles, or through direct growth within non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma reactors.  Size is a crucial parameter for diamond nanocrystals in that it impacts how quickly these materials are cleared from the body through filtration in the kidneys.  Furthermore, composition is critically important for diamond nanocrystals in that it determines the optical and electronic properties.  Currently there are no synthetic protocols that enable control over both the 1) size and 2) defect composition of diamond nanocrystals. This research will generate valuable fundamental knowledge for controlling both of these crucial parameters.  Additionally, there currently is no known shallow n-type donor in diamond materials.  This research will also pursue the experimental demonstration of n-type conductivity within diamond nanocrystals that would be valuable to society at large by enabling beneficial high-frequency, high-power optoelectronic devices for information processing, UV water-purification, and extreme environment coatings. The educational outreach efforts proposed here will build a learning pathway for senior undergraduate students to develop skills with advanced numerical methods through the development of a numerical computing module integrated within the existing engineering curriculum at the University of Washington. These skills will prepare students for careers within the optoelectronic materials industry, or for continuing their education in graduate school. Outreach efforts to Native Alaskan elementary students, undergraduates in the Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program at the University of Alaska, and Indigenous Alliance outreach at UW will help inspire & retain the next generation of underrepresented materials scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Currently there are no options in the scientific literature for rationally synthesizing nanodiamonds with precise 1) sizes and 2) compositions. The intellectual merit of this proposal rests on generating new knowledge for how to use high-pressure/high-temperature diffusion-doping to generate precise 1) sizes and 2) optoelectronic point-defects in nanodiamond. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, four primary research milestones will be pursued over 5 years: 1) Test the hypothesis that reducing the grain-size of amorphous-carbon nanoparticles will reduce the thermodynamic conditions necessary to produce nanoscale diamond grains through high-pressure/high-temperature techniques. The chemical-potential for carbon atoms at the surface of amorphous-carbon is size-dependent (stemming from the Gibbs-Thomson effect) which may lower the minimum temperature and pressure of the amorphous-carbon / diamond phase-transition. 2) A predictive numerical model will be employed for photothermal heating of highly-absorbing amorphous-carbon materials in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell based on an analytical eigenfunction expansion solution for the energy partial differential equation using spherical coordinates. 3) Molecular doping strategies will be used to control the concentration of model point-defects using either silicon- or nickel- heteroatoms within the diamond lattice. 4) Prior results for synthesizing doped diamond nanocrystals from amorphous-carbon will inform high-risk / high-reward experimental efforts to observe a theoretically-proposed, polyatomic n-type defect center in diamond. The experimental & theoretical approaches will provide an integrated understanding of how the size and composition of amorphous-carbon grains determine final nanodiamond properties"

The solar wind is a stream of charged particles and magnetic fields blowing outward from the Sun, which varies in intensity with solar activity. Because of its interaction with the solar wind, the magnetosphere is compressed on the dayside and extended in a long ""magnetotail"" on the nightside. The stretched magnetotail field lines store energy extracted from the solar wind. This energy is released by a process called magnetic reconnection, the subject of the present study, during which magnetic energy is converted into plasma flows as well as heating and energization of plasmas within the Earth's magnetosphere. Magnetic reconnection occurs at two locations:  one in the near-tail at a distance of 15-30 Earth radii and the other in the distant tail at 100-200 Earth radii. The near-Earth reconnection is explosive, creating high-energy charged particles that are responsible for the dynamic auroras in the upper atmosphere but also for damage to Earth-orbiting satellites. Near-Earth reconnection is largely associated with space weather events called magnetic storms and substorms. In contrast, the distant tail reconnection (about which much less is known) is envisioned to be steadier. It is not understood how the two reconnection sites interact. Of major importance for the present study, fast plasma flows are produced moving both Earthward and tailward from each of these reconnection sites. A satellite at lunar orbit (~60 Earth radii) between the two sites has the important advantage of being able to detect tailward flows from the near-Earth site, and earthward flows from the distant tail site. Thus the connection between the two, and the impact on magnetotail conditions of each, can be investigated from the same mid-tail vantage point. New insights into magnetic reconnection from the suggested study are valuable for research in planetary magnetospheres, as well as astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. The suggested work will provide important training for graduate students. It also includes public outreach and educational activities.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goals described above, the proposers will analyze observations from the Artemus (Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun) satellites in lunar orbit at ~60 Earth radii using case and statistical studies to investigate the occurrence rates of reconnection outflows from both near- and distant-tail reconnection sites, their variations over a range of space weather conditions (quiescent to magnetic storming), the timing between them (i.e., which site activates first), as well as consequences to the mid-tail space environment, such as transient electric field enhancements, changes in the magnetic field geometry, and enhancements in high-energy particle fluxes."

The partnership between the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Public Schools, and Cincinnati State Technical Community College is particularly strong.  Each partner institution will take a leadership role in providing teachers with a menu of professional development activities that are related to each of the project's goals.  Thus, this plan will provide an exemplary model for creating synergy between high-needs school districts and institutions of higher learning as well as for master teacher development.<br/><br/>There is an emerging body of research that shows that opportunities for professional growth for teachers tend to diminish by the time they are beginning to be recognized as master teachers; a time when they are also likely to want to consider career trajectories in administration or higher education.  This ambitious plan is based on the hypothesis that if master teachers are provided with options to create new career paths they will be more likely to remain in the classroom.  Therefore, the project provides master teachers with a variety of options to advance their careers such as, learning how to teach dual credit or AP courses, serving as adjunct faculty, receiving certification to teach English Language Learners, participating in curriculum revision for pre-service teachers, or instructing and devising curricula for blended STEM e-learning.  The project's core activities, which include advanced content coursework, mentor training, and advanced pedagogical training is grounded in the literature on emerging instructional practices that have been shown to be effective.  Formative and summative evaluation will be performed using a mixed-methods approach to monitor progress toward the project goals for retention, master teacher development, and overall project effectiveness.  Classroom observations, surveys, and focus group interviews will be collected and analyzed to provide insight into whether or not master teachers are using their experiences to provide high-quality learning experiences, strengthening teaching networks through mentoring and other leadership activities, and developing action research plans.  Project results will be disseminated at national meetings held by the American Educational Research Association and in the journals such as, Educational Action Research, Innovative Higher Education, the Journal of STEM Education, and the Journal of Research in STEM Education."

The radars have been acquired, commissioned and test deployed and the investigators plan near-term scientific deployments to allow for high spatial (1.5 deg beamwidth or ca. 250 m2 pixels at 10 km range) and temporal (ca. 1-2 minute scan times) remote sensing of rainfall distribution/rate, the 3-D wind field and to discriminate between rainfall, hail and snow over regions of 10-30 km2.   Four complete custom-built mobile X-band (3 cm wavelength) radar systems were built by ProSensing Inc. and delivered to the University of Iowa.  The choice of X-band radar allowed for a small diameter antenna (6 ft diameter) to be trailer mounted for mobility.  Power requirements are met by portable 120 V generators.   The complete system includes the four radar antennae, elevation and azimuth variable pedestals mounted on truck trailers, and control, data acquisition and processing software and hardware.   The mobile radar network can support meteorological and hydrologic research requiring high resolution observations of precipitation and wind field variability within regional storm cells.  Research on multiple fronts of current interest in meteorology and hydrology will benefit from the radar network including: 1) fundamental studies of uncertainty in radar measurement of rainfall parameters in gauged basins; 2) multi-radar and LiDAR imaging of rainfall events to study non-linear scaling effects between the range of the national NEXRAD (Next Generation Radar) S-band network (avg 4 km2 pixel resolution, maximum range of reflectivity ~ 230 km) and elastic scanning LiDAR (meter scale pixel resolution; range  = 1-2 km); 3) studies of the effects of urbanization on meteorological and hydrologic processes; 4) flood prediction in ungauged basins; and 5) soil erosion processes.   <br/><br/>The radar equipment will be used in several field experiments in Idaho, Iowa, and Illinois such as the Midwestern Intensively Managed Landscape Critical Zone Observatory (IML-CZO) in the Sangamon River basin in Illinois and the Clear Creek basin near Iowa City, Iowa.

These batteries operate by reversibly inserting and removing Li-ions from electrochemically active host materials. The goal of this work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, is to build a deeper understanding of what happens at the atomic level of these hosts as Li-ions move through their crystal structures. This fundamental knowledge is crucial for increasing the rate at which batteries can be (dis)charged as well as prolonging their operational lifetime. In parallel, this work seeks to use this understanding to identify new Earth-abundant electrode materials for Na-ion batteries in order to reduce the cost of producing large-scale energy storage systems for electric vehicles and the grid. This project also focuses on encouraging middle school students in the Native American communities located within the Los Angeles area to increase their participation in STEM disciplines. Hands-on teaching demonstrations and experiments are used to demystify the often puzzling world of electricity and energy sciences to engage students in science from an early age.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Polyanionic transition metal compounds (like phosphates, sulfates, and silicates) are of critical importance to energy storage because they do not release oxygen on decomposition, which can exacerbate thermal runaway during cell failure, and are therefore considerably safer than oxide-based electrodes. While a large body of work has been dedicated to optimizing the electrochemical performance of these materials, there is a fundamental lack of understanding about the mechanism for Li-ion transport in these materials. Unlike state-of-the-art oxides, which effectively exhibit isotropic changes in their oxygen sublattice, polyanionic electrodes respond to the removal or insertion of Li through cooperative rotations of their rigid oxoanionic subunits. This work is focused on investigating the mechanism of alkali-ion diffusion in polyanionic intercalation hosts using high-resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques in order to characterize how the framework of these materials changes on charge and discharge. Understanding how these densely packed solids facilitate the motion of positively charged ions through their lattices is critical for accelerating the design of next-generation materials for batteries that can operate based on the transport of larger ions like Na."

An emerging new line of research is seeking to determine the complex relationship between explosive volcanism and lightning, specifically: The effect of lightning discharge on the textural and chemical properties of volcanic ash and the resulting signature of volcanic lightning occurrence in the geologic record. In addition to the formation of fulgurites as a result of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS) form in the atmosphere from the physical transformation of volcanic ash particles into spheres of glass due to the high heat generated during lightning discharge.  This project will characterize the physiochemical evidence of volcanic lightning by: 1) identifying LIVS in natural ash fall deposits and analyzing their textural/chemical properties using established methods; 2) performing a series of triggered lightning experiments on manufactured ash samples of known composition and grain size to characterize the physical/chemical effects of volcanic lightning on the samples using various analytical methods; 3) establishing a research team of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to perform the experiments and analyze the samples; and 4) developing grade school curricula for teaching natural hazards in local schools in order to engage students in the Earth sciences. Fundamental questions addressed by this project, and the integral educational component that involves learners of all ages, may result in potentially transformative concepts the geosciences, atmospheric sciences, and hazard assessment. Textural and geochemical data acquired on the samples will provide evidence for volcanic lightning in the geologic record, allowing researchers to identify these events during eruptions that preceded or eluded human documentation.   Results will also reveal the role that lightning plays in altering the chemical characteristics of the local environment.  Additionally, the triggered lightning experiments, conducted on manufactured ash samples of known composition, will allow video documentation of fulgurite formation.  Through scientific and community presentations, this project will build further interest in volcanology, atmospheric dynamics, and the complex interplay between these natural phenomena, not only in the scientific community, but also in schools and amongst the general public.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to characterize the physical/chemical evidence of volcanic lightning occurrence in tephra deposits, which will aid in understanding the frequency of volcanic lightning in the geologic record, contributing to advancing scientific knowledge of volcano-atmosphere interactions, which is an emerging new line of scientific research. Ash fall deposits from numerous volcanic eruptions in Alaska will be analyzed, as volcanic lightning was documented during these explosive events and samples were provided by the Alaska Volcano Observatory.  Triggered lightning experiments will be conducted at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) on manufactured ash samples (pseudo-ash samples) of known composition and grain size. The established analytical methods that will be utilized for this project include: 1) Scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and electron spin resonance (ESR) examination of lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS) present in natural ash samples to determine their textural and chemical characteristics; 2) ESR, Mossbauer, and titration analyses of both natural, unmodified ash and pre-experimental pseudo-ash; and 3) SEM, TEM, ESR, Mossbauer, and titration analyses of LIVS and fulgurites produced in the triggered lightning experiments.  A research team of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will perform the experiments and analyze the samples. The various analyses, when conducted on the pseudo-ash samples prior to and following the triggered lightning experiments, will allow a direct means to determine the effect of lightning discharge on the morphological transformation, general chemistry, and oxidation/Fe valence state of exposed materials.  The natural ash samples will allow a chemical comparison between normal (i.e., unmodified) ash and any LIVS present in the deposits. Following publication of results, the videos of triggered lightning experiments will be displayed on the University of Alabama?s Tephra Lab website, on YouTube, and showcased in the Alabama Museum of Natural History, along with samples of both natural fulgurites and fulgurites created in the triggered lightning experiments.

The initial work will focus on palladium (Pd) and palladium-gold (PdAu) clusters as the active catalytic materials, but learning derived from those materials will be used to generate guiding principles and activity descriptors to identify inexpensive alternatives to PdAu catalysts.  To achieve these goals, a combination of kinetic and (ex situ and in situ) infrared spectroscopic techniques will be employed to probe the catalytic chemistry at the liquid-solid interfaces of supported metal clusters.  This investigation will involve design parameters such as: size and composition of the metal clusters, the role of electrophilic adsorbates, and solvent properties such as pH and polarity.  Although these studies specifically target the direct synthesis of H2O2, the work will develop tools and expertise needed for future investigations of a broad range of oxidative and reductive chemistries at liquid-solid interfaces."

Traditional bulk-rock element and isotope analyses have left too many fundamental questions about the architecture of crustal magmatic systems, resolution of which is a goal of this study through a new approach of utilizing micro-scale geochemical analysis of individual crystals in plutons. This research will also provide better data for numerical modeling efforts and has great potential to guide future studies of plutonic rocks.<br/><br/>This study will use texturally-constrained, element and isotope geochemical analysis of compositionally heterogeneous rock-forming and accessory minerals from strategically selected sites of the Tuolumne Intrusive Complex ? which was once a composite, mid-crustal arc magma reservoir - to test the following hypotheses. (1) Mineral zoning and inclusion relationships in plutonic rocks record distinct, decipherable magmatic histories. (2) Interconnected magma mush zones exist in mid-crustal reservoirs. (3) Mixing of crystal-rich magmas occurs between magmas injected from deeper levels and coexisting mush zones. (4) Crystal-liquid separation is an important process in the middle crust; consequently, many plutonic rocks are cumulate and do not represent liquid compositions. Testing these hypotheses will allow assessment of two models for mid-crustal arc plutons. A dike model predicts that magmas attain their chemical signatures in deep-crustal ?hot zones? and rise rapidly to sub-volcanic reservoirs without producing large magma bodies. A magma mush column model predicts that magmas form vertically-extensive reservoirs and undergo compositional modification at many crustal levels. Mineral analysis will allow identification of distinct mineral populations, interpretation of prevalent magmatic processes, assessment of the presence or absence of coeval magmas and their dimensions, and the ability of such magmas to chemically ?communicate?. <br/>"

Approximate computing has shown promise for both reducing energy consumption and improving performance across different applications, especially those in image processing, machine learning and data analytics. To date, approximate computing has been inapplicable to FSM modeling of computations, which has important applications in domains that include biological science, cyber security, data compression, software engineering and hardware design. Growing data volumes and limitations on computer processing power constrain FSM?s efficiency. The establishment of FSM-centric approximate computing will open the door to a new dimension of efficiency optimization for software applications.<br/><br/>This research will take advantage of the synergy between FSM computations and approximate computing --- the inherent error tolerance capability within FSM computations --- to develop a computing platform for exploring approximate FSM computations. The key idea is a quantitative analysis of FSM reliability that captures how errors generated by underlying approximate hardware propagate through FSM transitions. Additionally, this research will also design and implement two complementary approximation schemes --- one relies on the ""inexactness"" of approximate hardware; the other provides pure software approximation and runs on conventional exact hardware. Together these approximation strategies will demonstrate the potential of FSM-centric approximate computing in improving the efficiency of FSM applications."

It has historically been thought to help people buffer risks. Largely, however, past work has focused on agricultural societies, with fewer studies considering how surpluses were produced and managed under other economic systems. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. William Marquardt, Victor Thompson, and Michael Savarese will conduct research at the Mound Key and Pineland archaeological sites to investigate the role of surplus production among the Calusa of southwest Florida, who were the most powerful group in peninsular Florida in the sixteenth century A.D. The Calusa king collected tribute from a population in excess of 20,000 distributed among 50 to 60 Calusa communities extending from the northern reaches of Charlotte Harbor to the Florida Keys. However, unlike the farming people of the interior river valleys of the southeastern U.S., the Calusa relied primarily on fish and shellfish for protein, collecting wild plant foods and using only a handful of plants from home gardens. Most importantly, they did not grow maize, which formed the basis of surplus production and political complexity for many groups across the Southeast. This project focuses on surplus production and distribution in a complex fisher-gatherer-hunter society. Few archaeologists have examined surplus production among fisher-gatherer-hunters, especially those in the sub-tropics. This research will shed light on long-term sustainability of fisheries, a topic of considerable world-wide interest, and address the potential impact of over-harvesting shellfish. The project will also help train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, both undergraduate and graduate students. As part of the research, the team will teach a field school that will involve students drawn from a broad geographical region. Students will be trained in research, as well as specialized methods and traditional archaeological excavation. The research will bring students with interests in archaeology, geology, and ecology together to address a burgeoning field in geoscience: conservation paleobiology (applying the theories and analytical tools of paleontology to solving problems concerning the conservation of biodiversity). The project will also partner with the Florida Public Archaeology Network as well as the Randell Research Center to engage the public throughout the research process.<br/> <br/>Specifically, by means of coring and archaeological excavations in structures thought to be fish and shellfish storage and processing features, the team will examine how the Calusa produced and managed large-scale food surpluses presumed to be necessary to sustain their large populations. This work aims to discover how surplus production was situated within the larger histories of the Calusa, and how these practices structured interactions with Europeans. This work will serve as a comparative study against examples that focus on the links between surplus, storage, social development, and the transition to agriculture and animal husbandry. Development of comparative case studies such as this one will help disengage the concepts of surplus, storage, and social relations in terms of both individual agency and collective action."

The rise of antibiotic-resistant microbes poses an urgent threat to public health, while bacteria resistant to disinfectants and other biocides present engineering challenges in numerous venues, ranging from wastewater treatment to biotechnology. Bacterial resistance has garnered significant scientific interest over the past several decades, leading to a relatively mature understanding of the molecular events underlying resistance in individual cells. However, relatively little is known about how these molecular events contribute to the large-scale behavior of bacteria communities, which are often comprised of heterogeneous mixtures of billions of cohabitating cells. Is the behavior of a collection of cells simply a sum of its molecular and cellular parts, or is it instead dominated by new phenomena that arise from the way those parts fit together? This project attempts to answer this question by combining quantitative experiments on bacterial populations with mathematical and computational models of bacterial communities. The goal is to understand the way cellular communities respond to toxic stimuli ranging from antiseptics to disinfectants and harsh chemicals in realistic environments that may change over time. The work will offer fundamental insights into the community-level behavior of microbial populations and complement the current molecular-level understanding of resistance and its evolution. On a practical level, it will contribute to new engineering strategies for controlling and optimizing microbial growth while enhancing secondary student engagement with science and engineering practices (SEP) in underrepresented rural communities.<br/><br/>This CAREER proposal includes integrated research and education plans focused on the evolution of resistance in bacterial populations. The goal of the research is to combine quantitative experiments on microbial populations with stochastic models of bacterial evolution to understand systems-level mechanisms by which cellular communities develop resistance to environmental stresses. The work will leverage customized, computer-automated microbial culture devices and high-throughput DNA sequencing to investigate the evolution of resistance to a wide range of deleterious stimuli, ranging from biocides to osmotic stress, in realistic environments characterized by spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations. More specifically, the project will explore the roles of population density and collateral sensitivity, which encompasses the trade-offs inherent in optimizing resistance for one environment, in modulating the rate of resistance evolution. The work will offer a quantitative, systems-level perspective to complement the current molecular-level understanding of resistance and its evolution. It will also lay the groundwork for new engineering strategies for controlling and optimizing microbial growth, with applications for biotechnology and public health, including the fight against antibiotic resistance.<br/>The educational component includes a multi-faceted approach to enhance secondary student engagement with science and engineering practices (SEP) in rural regions of Kentucky. The educational outreach is directly related to the proposed research on bacterial resistance and involves collaboration with a leading education expert at the University of Kentucky and partnerships with local educators through the Kentucky Valley Educational Cooperative (KVEC), a collection of educational groups serving schools in rural regions of eastern Kentucky. The project uses a combination of annual site visits to participating high schools, regular distance learning meetings with teachers, students and practicing scientists, and electronic and online tools inspired by the proposed research on antimicrobial resistance. The goal of the proposal is to engage students in SEP for systems-level analysis of biological systems, increase student awareness of careers at the interface of traditional disciplines, and improve specific skills and intuition for mathematical and computational modeling of complex systems.<br/>This CAREER award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Integrative Ecological Physiology Program of the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."

Recent catastrophic events, such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, shut down or interrupted essential and interdependent components of our national infrastructure, such as electric networks, fuel supplies, and transportation systems. This vulnerability is exacerbated by changing population dynamics. Those dynamics impose serious challenges to the capacity of the individual components of our infrastructure system to efficiently respond to both moderate disturbances and extreme events. The ultimate goal of this Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) collaborative research project is to increase the resilience of the interdependent population-infrastructure system during disturbances of various magnitudes (including operational uncertainties and disastrous disruptions). This research will benefit infrastructure system planning and operations by developing ""smart communities/cities"" where multiple stakeholders can work together to promote mutual interests. This research will also develop innovative educational and training modules to give future generations and practitioners a vision of efficient, resilient and socially vital built environments and means to approach it. Overall, the outcome of this interdisciplinary research will benefit society through energy savings and economic enhancement by means of better infrastructure design and communication systems.<br/><br/>The purpose of this interdisciplinary research is to develop a distributed heterogeneous flow-based modeling framework to quantify the critical and complex interdependence of multiple infrastructure systems and population groups. The framework will also assist in analyzing short-term mobility behaviors and long-term social and demographic evolution of the critical connection between population and infrastructure. These objectives will be achieved by: 1) quantifying the interactions of different demographic groups with multiple infrastructures, 2) characterizing infrastructure facilities in several interconnected yet diverse systems, 3) modeling and optimizing the interdependent population-infrastructure system in a self-organized distributed system in which various infrastructure and population agents communicate on a cyber-platform, and 4) analyzing the important theoretical properties of this integrated model (e.g., system equilibrium and stability). This research makes three key intellectual contributions. First, a heterogeneous-flow-based network modeling method will define the dynamics and equilibria of several interdependent infrastructure systems. Second, the infrastructure model in a nexus with population characteristics allows examination of the two-way interactions between heterogeneous infrastructure facilities and different population groups. Third, this model will be integrated with a distributed cyber-communication platform based on self-organized ""swarm intelligence"" to create a realistic system in which multiple parties behave autonomously by communicating their respective available information."

In vertebrates, this process controls graft rejection and auto-immune responses.  In colonial invertebrates -- animals like marine sponges, corals, and sea squirts -- this ability is called allorecognition. Allorecognition controls whether colonies aggressively compete for space or peacefully coexist when they encounter one another as they grow. Despite the biological significance of this phenomenon, the genes and proteins that underlie it remain poorly understood. In this project, the investigators will study the molecular basis of allorecognition in a cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Recently, two genes controlling allorecognition in Hydractinia have been identified. The investigators will determine how the proteins encoded by these genes allow Hydractinia to properly distinguish self from non-self. To do this, the investigators will combine biochemical experiments with computer modeling and x-ray crystallography to build a structural model of the proteins, which will reveal how they enable Hydractinia to discriminate between self and non-self. This knowledge will fill a significant gap in our understanding of invertebrate allorecognition and form the basis of future work to investigate how these phenomena evolve. As part of their work, the investigators will train two undergraduates, two graduate students, and one postdoc in protein biochemistry and structure determination. They will provide opportunities for three high school students to conduct independent research projects in their laboratories. They will also develop and implement an educational program about Hydractinia for elementary school students in southwestern Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>In Hydractinia, two allorecognition proteins, Alr1 and Alr2, discriminate between self and non-self. Preliminary studies indicate these proteins engage in isoform-specific binding across cell membranes. This binding is hypothesized to be a general feature of both proteins and to be mediated by trans interactions between immunoglobulin superfamily-like (IgSF-like) domains in their extracellular regions and the formation of disulphide-linked cis multimers. Aim 1 will identify segments in the extracellular regions of each protein that control binding specificity and test whether the proteins form cis multimers via disulphide bonds. Aim 2 will identify amino acid positions within these segments that determine their binding profiles and use computational modeling to explore hypothesized binding mechanisms. Together, Aims 1 and 2 will be used to create a structural model of isoform-specific binding. Aim 3 will validate this model by determining the crystal structures of the extracellular domains of Alr1 and Alr2. Our team combines three PIs with expertise in invertebrate allorecognition, computational biology, and x-ray crystallography. The expected outcome of this project will be the first mechanistic understanding of how allorecognition proteins discriminate between self and non-self in any invertebrate. Comparison of this structural mechanism with those in other self-recognition systems will reveal which aspects of molecular recognition are unique to Hydractinia and which are shared with other species. The data generated in this project will guide future projects investigating how sequence evolution at allorecognition genes leads to novel allorecognition specificities and how signaling through the allorecognition proteins regulates allorecognition responses."

However, most studies have focused on a limited number of species in laboratory settings and have therefore ignored the many indirect effects originating from more complex species interactions that occur in nature. Coral reefs harbor more species than any other marine ecosystem. Moreover, they are economically very important, providing food and other services such as touristic attractions and pharmaceuticals. Because of the sensitivities of coral species to ocean acidification, reef ecosystems are potentially severely threatened, but we still have no idea how entire reef communities will respond. The project  will take advantage of a recently discovered, naturally acidified coral reef system in Papua New Guinea that is bathed by waters of variable levels of acidity, including levels comparable to those expected globally by the end of the 21st century. This project investigates the consequences of ocean acidification for the biodiversity of animals that live cryptically within the interstices of coral reefs. These animals represent the bulk of coral reef diversity; they play very important roles in the reef food chain but are poorly understood. Using DNA markers and photo analysis, cryptic species living at three different acidity levels (present day, expected in 50 years, expected in 100 years) will be quantified and identified in order to elucidate the changes occurring in coral reef communities as oceans acidify. Results will broaden understanding of the consequences of ocean acidification and allow for more accurate monitoring and effective management strategies for coral reefs. Scientific results will be shared at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and data collected will be made publicly available. The project will also foster active collaborations among scientists, professional educators, and science communicators from the Smithsonian Institution and Washington DC high school students underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. The students will be trained in ocean acidification science and will be involved in developing outreach products for Smithsonian onsite and online audiences, expanding the ability of the Smithsonian to share these results with the general public.<br/><br/>Ocean acidification (OA) is now affecting the fragile coral reef ecosystems already impacted by decades of local pressures (e.g., pollution, overfishing). Numerous laboratory experiments have shown deleterious effects of low pH on calcification, growth, and reproduction of reef organisms. Studies have also highlighted differences in species' responses depending on whether they are tested alone or in multi-species assemblages, suggesting the importance of indirect effects in sensitivity to OA that cannot be assessed from laboratory experiments. For this reason, shallow tropical submarine carbon dioxide seeps provide invaluable opportunities to assess the ecological consequences of long-term exposure to low pH for coral reefs in situ by providing a natural gradient in pH across reef seascapes. Among these are the reefs at Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea, which exhibit a strong gradient from normal to low pH waters but otherwise resemble normal reef conditions in terms of other chemical properties and temperature. Most work to date on acidified reefs, including at Milne Bay, has focused on corals and other conspicuous organisms. However, the vast majority of reef diversity is comprised of the understudied cryptic communities living within the reef structure. These trophically crucial groups are likely to be at risk from OA due to reduction in three-dimensional complexity typical of acidified reefs, but there are scant data. This research will measure structural changes in these communities across the well-characterized pH gradients of the Milne Bay reefs. The investigators will study diversity patterns in volumetrically standardized sampling structures deployed at three pH regimes (regular ~8.0, medium ~7.8-7.9 and low ~7.6-7.8) spanning the pH range predicted over the next one hundred years. Using photo analysis, and DNA barcoding of the bigger motile and sessile taxa and metabarcoding of the bulk sessile and small motile fractions , the investigators will evaluate spatial coverage, diversity and abundance of the species present across the pH gradient. The study will test the hypothesis that invertebrate diversity will decrease with decreasing pH and that taxonomic composition will shift to a community more resistant to acidified waters (e.g. non-calcifiers).

Increasingly demanding programs are run by users on handheld platforms powered by batteries. Therefore, specialized hardware components, i.e., IP cores, are introduced to improve handhelds? energy efficiency. However, the memory access patterns of CPUs and IPs are dramatically different, making main memory a critical bottleneck for a handheld system. Non-volatile memories, particularly STT-MRAM, are emerging as replacements for the existing DRAM-based main memory, achieving a wide variety of advantages. Nevertheless, substituting DRAM with STT-MRAM in handhelds also results in new design challenges such as read disturbance. Consequently, two read disturbance mitigation schemes are proposed in this project, constructing a high performance and reliable memory framework for handheld platforms.<br/><br/>In this research, a flexible STT-MRAM read scheme, namely FlexRead, is proposed to optimize handheld platform performance and energy efficiency under read disturbance. FlexRead combines the advantages of two existing data sensing schemes, dynamically issuing the best sensing scheme based on the runtime system state. Furthermore, an application flow pattern prediction scheme, namely FlowPaP, is proposed to identify and remove unnecessary memory restores originally required for preventing read disturbance. FlowPaP analyzes the data flow behavior in the applications running on handhelds, recognizing that the memory is in a consistent loop of being alternately written and read. These two proposed schemes optimize multiple handheld platform design aspects, thus having a transformational impact on the handheld research community, industrial products, and even society. The discovered read disturbance issue is an important and realistic design challenge for future handheld platform generations. Moreover, the proposed research can benefit the courses and research seminar taught by the PI, also advancing the education of students from highly diverse backgrounds, e.g., those from under-represented groups in the STEM field."

The number of these structures and their shapes give each neuron a particular appearance, and allow neurons to form specific connections with each other that result in the nervous system's ability to function properly. Currently, the ways in which particular combinations of molecules regulate axon and dendrite morphology in the developing nervous system of mammals are not well understood.  Previous scientific work has found a family of molecules called Semaphorins that control both axon and dendrite morphology by binding to molecules on the outer membrane of nerve cells (called receptors). This project will investigate what happens inside developing nerve cells after Semaphorin molecules bind to their receptors, in order to provide invaluable new details about the molecular control systems inside cells that ultimately determine the proper formation of neuronal connections and signaling functions.  In addition to this scientific goal, this project will integrate research, mentorship and education for minority high school, undergraduate and graduate students through their joint involvement in STEM enrichment opportunities.  Due to a unique collaboration between the principal investigator and a scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, an exchange program will also be established to provide female scientists with broader exposure and training experiences at both the national and international level.  Data generated from this study will be disseminated in the form of presentations at national/international scientific meetings, and will be published in peer-reviewed journals that can be accessed by other scientists and the general public.  New reagents and resources generated from this study will be freely shared with the broader scientific community and will be sent to archiving databases and repositories.            <br/><br/>Neurons exhibit diverse morphologies, and developmentally acquire the unique axonal and dendritic arborizations necessary for their specific functions.  Cell surface receptors are known to control this complex process, mainly by eliciting attractive/permissive or repulsive/inhibitory cellular responses in distinct neuronal populations.  However, the intracellular mechanisms underlying these multi-functional responses to receptor-initiated signaling events are still poorly understood.  The Plexin-A4 receptor that binds the Semaphorin-3A ligand is known to collapse growth cones on the axons of sensory neurons, while it promotes dendrite formation in cortical neurons.  The specific aims of the present project are to 1) elucidate the mechanistic logic underlying these disparate functions of the Plexin-A4 receptor; and 2) to determine whether the Plexin-A4 cytoplasmic domains activate similar or different intracellular signaling cascades during axon collapse and dendrite formation.  Novel mouse genetic tools generated for this project will be used to determine which signaling cytoplasmic domains of Plexin-A4 are required for these disparate functions. One candidate Plexin-A4 downstream interactor that may play key roles in both axon growth cone collapse and dendrite elaboration will be examined following semaphorin activation of Plexin-A4 signaling in sensory versus cortical neurons.  High-throughput, morphology based siRNA screening will be performed to identify additional novel downstream components of the Plexin-A4 signaling cascade that regulate dendrite and growth cone behaviors.  The results will provide key mechanistic insights about how neurons establish their unique cellular morphologies, explain how Plexin-A4 regulates axon and dendrite behavior, and identify novel molecules in the Semaphorin-3A signaling pathway that impact the formation and organization of neuronal connections during nervous system development."

However, the available membranes for important applications such as CO2/CH4 and C3H6/C3H8 separations are restricted by their deteriorated separation performance when made into industrial thin films operating in the presence of strongly plasticizing components of CO2 and heavy hydrocarbons. These polymers may have superior pure-gas separation performance in thick films of 20 m or more.  However, in the thin films of ~100 nm for industrial composite membranes, these polymers show gas permeability rapidly decreasing with time (i.e., aging). The CO2 and hydrocarbons swell the polymer matrix (i.e., plasticization), leading to weaker size sieving ability and reduced gas selectivity. This project will address these issues by developing a molecular-based mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the polymer structure and thin film properties including permeability, selectivity, aging and plasticization. The integrated educational activities are expected to achieve the following benefits: (a) an educational module for teachers and their students in middle school and high school in the Buffalo Public Schools (a district with a large fraction of students whose background is underrepresented in STEM fields) on membrane technology to solve global climate change; (b) an ongoing polymer workshop to promote the interdisciplinary collaboration on the Buffalo campus and in the Western New York area; (c) improvement in the core courses of Heat and Mass Transfer and Materials Characterization to stimulate students? interests in membrane research; and (d) interdisciplinary training opportunities in polymer synthesis, characterization, membrane separation and modeling for students at the undergraduate and graduate level.  <br/><br/>The research project will elucidate the effect of polymer pendant rings and crosslinking in the advanced polymeric materials on membrane gas separation properties, including gas permeability and selectivity, thin film stability against aging, and stability against hydrocarbon induced plasticization. These bulky pendent rings disrupt the polymer chain packing, leading to high free volume and permeability, and they are also expected to slow the chain motion, reducing densification or physical aging. The size of the rings will be conveniently tuned during the chemical synthesis, and substituents will be introduced to rationally design the structure. A bottom-up design of crosslinking networks will be generated, which are expected to be resistant to plasticization. A modified free volume model will be used to elucidate the effect of aging and plasticization on membrane separation properties. This interdisciplinary research program integrating materials discovery, synthesis, characterization, modeling and applications will enrich the fundamental understanding of polymer structure/property correlation for membrane gas separation. It is anticipated that the technical approach and materials design guidelines derived from this project will be directly applied to the development of industrial membranes for energy-efficient gas separation. This CAREER project is also expected to enhance students? awareness of materials design and discovery to solve important practical problems."

The links between terrestrial and marine ecosystems are especially tight in the coastal temperate rainforests of Alaska and British Columbia. Abundant rainfall moves nutrients held in glaciers, dense forests, and wetlands to estuaries and fjords, supporting productive fisheries and robust marine mammal populations. This region includes the largest remaining old-growth forests in North America; has among the highest rates of glacier melt on the planet; supports billion-dollar fishing and tourism industries; and is home to tens of thousands of people who depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. Because the movement of fresh water and nutrients plays a key role in these linked ecosystems, climate-driven changes in this flow may impact coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. The Coastal Rainforest Margins Research Network is an international research collaborative that will facilitate a better understanding of these processes and impacts. This Network will establish a core community of scientists and stakeholders to function as an information and guidance resource for ecosystem management and community adaptation into the future. An improved understanding of this ecosystem will help build resilience in local communities and ecosystems in a warming and increasingly variable climate. Additionally, it will provide a foundation for understanding climate-driven changes within coastal temperate rainforests and coastal margins worldwide.<br/><br/>The Coastal Rainforest Margins Research Network will be composed of research communities organized within key disciplines, including hydrology, forest ecology, soil science, biogeochemistry, and near-shore marine ecology. These disciplinary communities will address critical information gaps, develop regional collaborations, and synthesize knowledge regarding water, carbon, and nutrient fluxes in a landscape where intense transformations and rapid transfers between terrestrial and freshwater environments control the delivery of these materials to the coastal ocean. The Network will achieve these goals through three main activities: 1) structured information exchanges among Network participants, including regular teleconferences, research webinars, field site visits, web-hosted meetings, and annual multi-day workshops that bring the entire Network together; 2) creation of working groups to develop data collection, management and sharing protocols; and 3) development of outreach products useful to Network members as well as policy-makers and resource managers."

Springs rich in hydrogen sulfide represent some of the most extreme freshwater environments, because hydrogen sulfide halts energy production in animal cells. Nonetheless, some fish have colonized sulfide springs throughout the Americas, and it remains unknown how they can tolerate conditions so toxic that most other organisms perish. This project will compare closely related populations that live in adjacent sulfidic or nonsulfidic habitats to identify differences in genetic, biochemical, and physiological traits that underlie tolerance to this noxious chemical. It involves the identification of genetic differences between hydrogen sulfide-tolerant and susceptible populations, particularly in genes associated with pathways affected by hydrogen sulfide toxicity or detoxification. In addition, the tolerance and the susceptibility of fish populations will be measured in the presence or absence of hydrogen sulfide. This project will yield new insights into mechanisms underlying physiological tolerance to hydrogen sulfide and the workings of animals in the presence of physiochemical stressors. Given hydrogen sulfide's role in cellular processes and disease formation, this also has implications for biomedical applications. This project provides training opportunities in integrative biology for participants at all levels of higher education. It will also contribute to science education and public outreach through the generation of an exhibit at a local zoo and the involvement of high school teachers that will generate lesson plans implementing next generation science education standards for K-12 education in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Leveraging knowledge from toxicological and biomedical studies, this project addresses hypotheses about mechanisms of physiological adaptation to naturally H2S-rich environments and focuses on components of and associated with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OXPHOS) in mitochondria. These components include targets of H2S toxicity as well as enzymes involved in H2S detoxification. It is predicted that focal components are modulated or modified in sulfide spring populations, such that individuals have an increased ability to withstand elevated H2S concentrations, an increased ability to detoxify H2S enzymatically, and an ability to maintain or even increase mitochondrial energy production by using H2S a substrate to fuel metabolism. Furthermore, it is anticipated that modification of OXPHOS components has occurred repeatedly across independent lineages that have colonized sulfide springs. To test these predictions, this project focuses on an established model system (Poecilia mexicana) for the investigation of H2S adaptation and has three major empirical components: (1) Characterization of transcriptional and coding variation in candidate genes by use of high-throughput sequencing techniques and subsequent validation of effects on protein concentrations and structure. (2) Quantification of functional consequences of transcriptional and coding variation for H2S detoxification and bioenergetics both in vitro and in vivo. (3) Comparison of gene sequence and expression variation across a dozen independent population pairs from sulfidic and non-sulfidic habitats to test for convergence."

A multiscale approach is proposed that borrows concepts and tools reserved for turbulent flow analysis. Preliminary results with 2D direct numerical simulations (DNS) are available. These will be used to obtain boundary conditions for a spectral, high resolution 3D DNS. The 3D results will be used to develop a reduced order that can provide results faster than the DNS.

In consultation with these partners, the FRAMEWORK program has developed broad research problems that complement the strengths of faculty mentors at UW and CSM. Proposed projects include uncertainty quantification for subsurface flow and renewable energy problems, the modeling and simulation of infectious disease dynamics, and computational methods for detecting material flaws in the wheels of railroad cars, among others.

The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).<br/><br/>The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project."

In this project the research team investigates dynamic solution- and surface-chemical processes that provide new methods for the controlled synthesis of crystalline materials and their direct integration with soft materials yielding hybrid structures with useful properties (e.g., optical, electrical, etc.).  In complimentary activities, the principal investigator uses the methods and outcomes of the research activities in the creation of new educational curriculum and outreach activities that strengthen the tradition of innovation and the participation of underrepresented groups (especially Native American youths) in materials science in Nebraska.<br/>  <br/>Technical Abstract<br/>With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the EPSCoR program, this project seeks to generate new approaches to controlling crystal growth that enable the direct fabrication of hybrid structures which combine soft materials with complex, three-dimensional, inorganic materials.  Such seamless integration of components with exceedingly different properties (thermal and mechanical) cannot be achieved using traditional microfabrication.  This project includes the following specific goals: (i) Utilize mechanical deformations of chemically functionalized soft polymers to actively control the synthesis, assembly, and 2D organization of hard materials enabling the fabrication of hybrid structures with reconfigurable properties.  (ii) Synthesize hierarchical, 3D crystal morphologies and hybrid materials using the effects of flowing liquids in soft reactors.  The approaches to controlling crystal growth under investigation emphasize dynamic manipulation of physical variables surface chemistry and fluid flow that go beyond those available in systems which use rigid materials or static conditions.  Specifically, the deformation of elastomeric substrates provides a convenient way to reversibly change surface chemistry and manipulate the spatial organization of crystals; the flow of liquids in reactors can simultaneously tune the chemical and fluid-mechanical environments of crystals.  These research activities contribute significantly to the realization of new, additive approaches to the direct production of functional, hybrid materials with applications in existing and emerging technologies including, microelectronics, energy, and soft, stretchable, and flexible electronics and sensors."

Statistical dependence between variables is represented combinatorially via edges in a graph, and this allows both model interpretability and computationally efficient inference. For these reasons, GMs are at the core of machine learning and artificial intelligence and have been used in a variety of applied fields, including finance, operations research, biology, signal processing, and social networks. For large complex data with non-obvious structure, the central problem is that of learning an appropriate model. Learning a graphical model presents both a computational and statistical challenge. The combinatorial nature of the problem means that there are a huge number of possible models to explore. At the same time, the high-dimensional nature of modern applications means that the number of data-points is often much smaller than the dimension of the ambient parameter space: learning algorithms must therefore make efficient use of the data, which is scarce relative to the problem size. Existing approaches to learning graphical models achieve either statistical efficiency or computational efficiency, but not both.<br/><br/>This research aims for the best of both worlds: extreme computational and statistical efficiency. While practical applications demand such efficiency, it is unlikely to be attainable in complete generality, for all models. The question is, what features of real-world systems allow for tractable learning? The research entails identifying specific model subclasses of interest and developing algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Concretely, the research provides new information-theoretic lower bounds on the amount of data required to learn, and informed by these lower bounds, gives fast (computationally efficient) algorithms that are statistically near optimal."

As researchers attempt to uncover why some students are more likely to pursue STEM careers, they increasingly have focused on motivational and self-regulatory factors that have been shown to impact students' educational and occupational choices. One construct that some researchers have focused on is grit, defined as one's perseverance and passion in the pursuit of long-term, challenging goals. grit has become very popular in the scientific community and the national media, and some have argued that researchers and practitioners need to help students increase their grit. However, grit's validity, especially in relation to conceptually similar motivational and self-regulatory constructs, and for different ethnic and gender groups, has not been systematically explored. It is essential to establish grit as a valid psychological construct before designing grit-based interventions intended to enhance students' achievement in STEM and other areas.<br/><br/>The proposed study is a longitudinal validation study of grit and its relations to STEM outcomes. It will be conducted with an ethnically and economically diverse sample of middle and high school students. Students will be surveyed twice in 8th grade and once in 9th grade, and their levels of grit and other motivation, self-regulatory, and personality variables will be measured. Information about students' choices to take STEM courses, their grades in STEM courses, and their anticipated major in college will also be collected. Using sophisticated Item Response Theory (IRT) and other latent variable modeling procedures, grit's convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity will be assessed over time, and gender and ethnic differences will be examined. The project will be transformative in its use of sophisticated analysis strategies to examine grit's uniqueness from other theoretically based motivation and self-regulation constructs that have clear relations to STEM outcomes."

The event will take place in conjunction with (and on the first day of) the Ninth International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams (DIAGRAMS 2016), to be held August 7-10, 2016, in Lafayette Hill (Philadelphia), PA.  Diagrams are wide-ranging and open-ended representations that include sketches, drawings, charts, pictures, 2D and 3D geometric models, and maps. They are a vital tool in human communication in areas such as art and science, as well as commerce and industry. A better understanding of how effective diagrams can be generated and used has the potential to produce transformative advances in these areas. DIAGRAMS is the only conference series that provides a forum for all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams. It is a bi-annual, international and interdisciplinary event whose goals are to present and discuss (a) state-of-the-art research on computational, cognitive and socio-cultural theories, models and techniques of reasoning with diagrammatic representations, and (b) cutting-edge intelligent and interactive information technologies for using diagrammatic representations in supporting human reasoning. Research topics include understanding diagrammatic reasoning in humans, understanding the use of diagrammatic representation for communication, developing techniques for automated diagrammatic reasoning, and designing tools for use of diagrammatic representations. The conference series is overseen by the DIAGRAMS Steering Committee with a rotating membership; more information is available at the conference website http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2016. DIAGRAMS 2016 will significantly increase our understanding of diagrammatic reasoning in humans and machines, and will add momentum to the development of new information technologies for the use of diagrammatic representations in support of human reasoning. The conference will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and by catalyzing new collaborations. The Doctoral Consortium will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and help train them by providing early input from senior researchers in the field in an interactive and constructive environment. The social network among this next generation of researchers, and the relationships with senior researchers, created by the workshop will play a critical role in their enculturation into the profession. Diversity of the selected students is a goal of the organizers, who will be proactive in an effort to ensure that both students and faculty are a diverse group across multiple dimensions including nationality, scientific discipline and gender. To further assure diversity, only one student will be selected from each educational institution, with preference given to students from underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the DIAGRAMS 2016 Doctoral Consortium is to increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas. The workshop will be a research-focused day-long meeting that affords participants an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from established researchers in the field, who will be present to comment on the young researchers' presentations in an informal and constructive environment. Each invited participant will have approximately half an hour for presentation of their research, that may include a short demonstration if appropriate, and which will be followed by discussion and critiquing. For some students, this may be their first opportunity to give a research talk outside their home institutions.  Therefore, each student will be assigned a mentor (selected from the Program Committee), who will preview the student's presentation and offer suggestions for improvement as well as provide sample questions that may arise during the discussion.  The Doctoral Consortium is open for attendance to all conference registrants, and summaries of the student presentations will be available on the conference website."

Thirty REU students (ten each year) are engaged in research teams to promote discovery, teaching, and training through hands-on research and mentoring. Students are mentored and trained in the basics of research techniques, the responsible conduct of research, the need for diversity in research, and research designs and methods. The REU Site students collaboratively pose, execute, and evaluate research projects resulting in research advances in Cyber-HealthGIS. Through this approach, students learn research and problem-solving outside of their own discipline, and gain independence and confidence in their own ability to undertake research. This program will advance the new field of Cyber-HealthGIS by building theory, methods, and approaches which will lead to joint faculty-student publications in research journals, seminars, and conferences, and student presentations of their own research. This program fills a critical US workforce gap by creating a generation of students trained for and interested in research and scientific careers in Cyber-HealthGIS, a rapidly advancing field with the potential to improve human health and well-being. The student projects and example prototypes developed through this program will be made freely available to help foster innovation and development in the Cyber-HealthGIS industry.<br/><br/>In this REU Site, the ideas from each student's academic/disciplinary domain is integrated to form a cohesive, achievable research goal under the umbrella of the core research themes of this project, which include (1) Outbreak surveillance through the combination of authoritative and social media data; (2) High-resolution chronic disease risk mapping with citizen-derived perceptions of community; and (3) Continuous time-enabled scalable outbreak planning. Students work closely with faculty mentors to pose the research question, develop testable hypotheses, obtain the necessary data, organize appropriate methods, engineer an approach, perform experiments, and undertake an evaluation of the results. This project will make freely available examples of prototype applications, thereby advancing the capabilities of Cyber-HealthGIS research through the development and release of free and open source (FOSS) code for the systems and example data sets used in the student research and experiments."

Training is conducted within a Preservation Archaeology ethos, a philosophy integrating big-picture research, use of existing collections, focused fieldwork, site preservation, and local community outreach. Under the close supervision of a team of experienced instructors, this program offers undergraduate students an immersive environment in which to learn the fundamentals of archaeological field and laboratory work, the tenets and practices of Preservation Archaeology, and how to link their work to broader anthropological issues that have contemporary relevance. Specifically, students are trained in excavation and survey techniques, experimental archaeology, artifact processing and analysis, report-writing, and public presentation.  Based on the premise that sites are non-renewable resources, the Preservation Archaeology Field School is training the next generation of academic, private sector, and government agency archaeologists. Student recruiting targets underrepresented groups, including Native American, Hispanic, and community/small college undergraduates with limited STEM opportunities, as well as exemplary students from major academic institutions to increase the diversity of views represented in the discipline.  <br/><br/>Student efforts contribute directly to Archaeology Southwest's long term research program focused on the Salado Phenomenon in the southern U.S. Southwest during the late pre-contact period (A.D. 1200-1450). This research studies the processes of migration and social integration of culturally diverse groups during this time of upheaval and crisis across much of the Southwest. Students think critically about the values of archaeology and history to different communities and explore different ways to communicate the results of scientific research. Students present their work to various audiences through participation in outreach events for the local community, writing research reports, and presentations at professional meetings. Even for students who do not go on to pursue careers in archaeology, it is excellent training to learn valuable skills in collaboration and collegiality, critical thinking, engaging the public, and the importance of cultural resources, in an active research setting."

High-throughput whole slide imaging (WSI) system is an important tool for various biological research applications. By using WSI systems, large-scale biological samples can be digitalized with high resolution in seconds or minutes, significantly increasing laboratory efficiency and promoting the progress of science. This project aims to develop a $100 WSI add-on kit for high-throughput multimodal microscopy imaging. By adapting this add-on kit to an existing regular microscope platform, one can convert it into a high-throughput, multimodal WSI platform. The result from the WSI add-on kit is a comprehensive digital rending of the entire sample, on the order of centimeter in size, visible at diffraction-limited resolution, in two or three dimensions, and with multiple imaging modalities. Experiments that were typically carried out manually in single cell level and addressed a limited field of view at a time can now be done for the entire sample in an automated and intelligent manner. As high-content images are desired in many fields of biological and biomedical research, the dissemination of the WSI add-on kit in ~$100 budget could lead to new types of experimental designs in small research labs and benefit various health-related applications.<br/> 	<br/>This project aims to develop the WSI add-on kit by integrating three different modules: 1) an autofocusing module that instantly identifies the optimal focal position of the sample, 2) a scanning module that drives the stages of a regular microscope in high speed, and 3) an illumination module that integrates multiple imaging modalities into the platform. For the autofocusing module, two pinhole-modulated cameras will be attached to the eyepiece ports for instant focal plane detection. By analyzing the captured images from these two eyepiece ports, one can infer the optimal focal position for a 2D thin section and the tomography structure of a 3D sample without a z-scan. Different z-sampling strategies can then be used for better image acquisition. For the scanning module, stepper motors and the associated gears will be used to control the motion of the microscope stages. Different mechanical coupling schemes will be tested and the best scheme will be chosen in terms of the scanning speed and positional repeatability. For the illumination module, a liquid crystal display will be inserted at the back-focal plane of the condenser lens. By setting different binary patterns on the display, this illumination module is able to integrate multiple imaging modalities into the platform, including brightfield, darkfield, phase contrast, quantitative phase, polarization, 3D tomography, and super-resolution Fourier ptychographic imaging. The education/outreach program of this project will include course development for graduate and undergraduate students at UConn, summer internships to high-school students and high-school/middle-school teachers. The knowledge generated through this project will be disseminated through conference presentations and workshops, publications in scientific journals, and news-room articles that raise the scientific literacy of the public. The protocol of building the WSI kit will be posted on a dedicated website. Industrial partners will be identified to promote the commercialization of the WSI add-on kit."

This project investigates new technical advances aimed at narrowing the gap between provable security and the practical demands of symmetric cryptography.<br/><br/>The project develops new cryptographic algorithms and proof techniques, drawing from techniques in theoretical computer science, applied mathematics, and information theory. This involves the study of combinatorial problems whose solutions yield security proofs for existing and new encryption paradigms, and the development of new provably secure methods to encrypt data from arbitrary domains. The project identifies widely deployed cryptographic methods without provable security guarantees, introduces new assumptions on their components and new frameworks to validate their security with proofs, and explores the tradeoff between efficiency and security of symmetric cryptographic algorithms. The project will organize an annual cryptography academy targeted at economically disadvantaged high-school students, to increase their interest and representation in computing."

These animals rely on bioluminescence for communication, feeding, and/or defense; so, the generation and detection of light is essential to their survival.  Our present knowledge of this phenomenon has been limited due to the difficulty in collecting live deep-sea animals, and the lack of proper techniques needed to study this complex system.  However, new genomic techniques are now available, and a team with extensive experience in deep-sea biology, vision, and genomics has been assembled to lead this project. This project will study three questions 1) What are the evolutionary patterns of different types of bioluminescence in deep-sea shrimp? 2) How are deep-sea organisms' eyes adapted to detect bioluminescence? 3) Can bioluminescent organs (called photophores) detect light in addition to emitting light?  Findings from this study will provide valuable insight into a complex system vital to communication, defense, camouflage, and species recognition.  This study will bring contributions to the fields of deep sea and evolutionary biology, and immediately improve our understanding of bioluminescence and light detection in the marine environment.  In addition to scientific advancement, this project will reach kindergarten through college aged students through the development and dissemination of educational tools, a series of molecular and organismal-based workshops, museum exhibits, public seminars, and biodiversity initiatives.  <br/><br/>This project combines phylogenomic, physiological, and molecular studies to test several hypotheses addressing the evolution of bioluminescence and light detection in a remarkable family of deep-sea shrimp.  All shrimp within the family Oplophoridae use a luminescent secretion discharged from the mouth to deter predators, while only some possess a second mechanism of bioluminescence in the form of photophores.  Photophores are light-emitting organs found across the body that are thought to function in counterillumination and mate attraction. These different types of bioluminescence emit light at slightly different wavelengths and spectral bandwidths.  Past studies have shown shrimp with both the secretion and photophores possess unique visual systems to distinguish between these different bioluminescence types.  However, an in-depth characterization, which combines genomic, molecular, and physiological methods, has never been applied to investigate this system.  In addition, how animals with photophores can so precisely match the downwelling irradiance has remained a long-standing mystery.   New preliminary evidence suggests that the photophores contain photopigment proteins (opsins) and other phototransduction genes that allow for light detection.  This is the first indication that autogenic light organs may also have light detection capabilities.  This raises the exciting possibility that some shrimp can ""see"" from structures other than their eyes and might provide a mechanism for their unique counterillumination abilities.  The first objective is to use phylogenomic methods to build a robust phylogeny to trace the evolutionary origins of the two bioluminescence modes (secretion and photophore) within oplophorid shrimp.  Secondly, this project will characterize the visual systems of deep-sea shrimp to better understand how shrimp distinguish between different wavelengths of emitted bioluminescence. Lastly, integrative methods will be used to examine photosensitivity in several non-bacterial (autogenic) light organs - the photophore and organs of Pesta (light organ of Sergestidae)."

As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education.<br/>This eight-week international REU Site brings eight undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to Sicily, Italy for four weeks to collect data from ancient human skeletons, and back to the United State for four weeks to work in the research laboratories at the University of Georgia. Students complete independent research projects relating to the health, activity patterns, diet, and genetic relatedness of people at the Greek colony and battlefield of Himera to better understand the biocultural consequences of culture contact in the past. Globalization is ever-increasing and often resembles colonization with its spread of ideas and people to developing nations. REU students will learn first-hand about deep roots and biological dimensions of interactions between diverse populations. Participants receive specialized field and lab training in archaeological chemistry, anatomy, research design, and data analysis. Students will leave the REU with greater technical and analytical skills, better preparedness for graduate study and professional careers, and heightened awareness of global issues relating to population contact, inequality, human conflict, and health transitions. These skills are foundational for improving global citizenship and stewardship in any career.<br/><br/>To promote scientific literacy and global engagement among undergraduates, this three-year REU Site integrates students as junior partners of the Bioarchaeology of Mediterranean Colonies Project, a cross-disciplinary, international research program that has brought undergraduate students to the Mediterranean for the past three summers. REU students generate new anthropological knowledge related to human adaptation and the impacts of culture contact in the ancient Mediterranean. Student projects focus on the more than 12,000 skeletons unearthed at Himera, which in the 7-5th centuries B.C. was the site of Greek colonizing efforts and violent battles. Himera represents an early epicenter of rising ethnic inequality. REU students plan and execute independent research projects exploring biocultural impacts of culture contact in Greek Sicily, including changes in diet, activity patterns, health, mobility, and genetic admixture, using stable isotope biogeochemistry, molecular anthropology, osteology, paleopathology and statistical analysis. Students collect bioarchaeological data from human skeletons at Sicily for four weeks, and spend the remaining four weeks at the University of Georgia (UGA) apprenticed in the UGA Bioarchaeology and Biochemistry Laboratory, analyzing field specimens. REU students participate in focused workshops and seminars, and work with dedicated mentors, receiving hands-on training for research projects. Through these activities, students (1) learn archaeological and anthropological field and lab methods, (2) learn from both American and Italian scholars, (3) visit museums and archaeological sites on Sicily, (4) design, execute, and present independent research projects that make substantive contributions to anthropology, (5) live in the city of Palermo, Italy where they will interact with Italian students and citizens, and (6) remain in close contact with faculty mentors for a full academic year to publish their results and present at international conferences. Two PhD student affiliates will gain mentorship training. REU students will leave better prepared to pursue and succeed in graduate school, excel in STEM careers, and be more globally engaged citizens."

Zircons from the Jack Hills locality in Western Australia have yielded great insights into the character of Hadean (i.e., >4 billion years ago, or Ga) magmas through investigation of both their trace chemistry and exotic phases trapped within the zircons as they grew (i.e., mineral inclusions).  However, fully exploiting the information recorded in these zircons and their inclusions has been hampered by a lack of foundational studies.  This project constitutes a series of investigations into various aspects of zircon trace element chemistry and inclusion character, which will allow for better understanding of the geologic processes acting on Hadean Earth. <br/><br/>Fundamental observations on the trace element chemistry and mineral inclusion character of the Hadean Jack Hills zircons have revealed several aspects of the chemistry and mineralogy of the magmas from which they grew.  Quartz and muscovite dominate thelikely primary inclusion assemblages of the zircons, suggesting shale-like precursors. The zircons also contain rare oxide, sulfide, and carbonaceous phases relevant to various under-explored aspects of their host magma chemistry, especially volatiles. However, questions remain as to how to distinguish primary inclusion assemblages, their relationship to magma chemistry, and the relevance of various aspects of host zircon trace chemistry to magmatic volatile contents.This project constitutes several allied investigations of Hadean zircon trace chemistry and inclusion character which can reveal important aspects of source melt chemistry and define objective criteria for distinguishing primary versus altered mineral inclusions. The discovery of carbonaceous inclusions in Hadean zircons allows for the documentation of carbon isotopic variations during the Hadean and early Archean.  In addition, the relationship of source magma trace element content and redox conditions with zircon chemistry and inclusion assemblages will be investigated using a suite of ~400 million year old granitoids of known composition and origin, and the results applied to better understand the last dark age of Earth history."

However, the Indian Ocean may be the least studied major marine body on the planet. Our limited understanding suggests extensive variations in physical and chemical environmental conditions, but how this variation influences biodiversity, nutrient stress, and more broadly regional differences in the functioning of phytoplankton is unknown. To help address these gaps, the investigators will conduct a study by joining an already-funded major research cruise to this region. It will cover a northern region with some of the highest temperatures recorded in open ocean waters, an area around 10S of predicted (but not tested in situ) iron stress, and a southern subtropical gyre with unique nitrogen to phosphorous(or N:P) ratios. The focus of this project is to quantify and synthesize the interconnectedness of environmental conditions, phytoplankton diversity and genome content, and nutrient biogeochemistry, with the goal of understanding how these may lead to unique biogeochemical regions in Indian Ocean. The research will have broader impacts on many levels. First, it will increase public awareness of the role of phytoplankton on ocean functioning, climate, and people's lives through a new partnership with the Aquarium of the Pacific (AOP), which is the fourth most-attended aquarium in the nation. Secondly, the project will train a postdoctoral scholar as well as a graduate and undergraduate students. Third, the research will dramatically increase our basic knowledge ocean biogeochemistry and in many cases will be the first measurements of their kind made in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>This project will address two major questions: How do environmental conditions, phytoplankton diversity, phytoplankton physiology, and biogeochemistry vary across the central Indian Ocean? Are there distinct biogeochemical regimes in the central IO? The researchers hypothesize that environmental conditions, including the relative availability of nitrogen (N) and iron (Fe), lead to three distinct phytoplankton communities and biogeochemical regimes. They will employ a series of advanced analytical tools including high sensitivity measurements of dissolved and particulate nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron), genomics, bioassays to test for nutrient stress, and cell-sorting of specific taxa followed by measures of nutrient content and uptake. A focus of this project is to quantify and synthesize the interconnectedness of environmental conditions, phytoplankton diversity and genome content, and nutrient biogeochemistry, and how these lead to unique biogeochemical regions in Indian Ocean. This extensive set of observations can ultimately be linked to ocean models and satellite data to provide a comprehensive view of regional differences in chemistry, biodiversity and phytoplankton biogeochemical functioning in the Indian Ocean."

These algorithms will be called resource-oblivious algorithms. These algorithms will enable efficient parallel code regardless of the ever-changing underlying hardware platforms allowing more focus on the correctness of implementations without the need of optimizing for a particular hardware. Porting code from one machine to another will be reduced or eliminated. In short, algorithms will be implemented once and continue to run efficiently.<br/><br/>One way of designing efficient resource-oblivious parallel algorithms for the multilevel cache-hierarchy of a multicore machine is to reverse the direction of information flow between the program and the hardware &#8213; instead of making choices based on hardware parameters, such as cache sizes and number of cores, the program now simply assists scheduling by telling the scheduler about the properties of the algorithm being run. This project will extend the notion of resource-obliviousness to networks of hybrid compute nodes containing both multicore processors and manycore coprocessors. A unified framework will be built bottom-up starting with programs that run solely on processors (stage 1) or mainly on coprocessors (stage 2) of a single node, followed by hybrid programs utilizing both processors and coprocessors of the same node (stage 3), and ending with programs for networks of hybrid nodes (stage 4). Each stage will have four outcomes.<br/>     - Algorithmic models of resources separately for evaluation and for execution of algorithms.<br/>     - Efficient resource-oblivious algorithms for a suite of representative problems with theoretical bounds on the evaluation model.<br/>     - Schedulers that guarantee practical program performance predicted by the evaluation model.<br/>     - Implementation and experimental evaluation of the schedulers and the algorithms on real machines.<br/><br/>This research will make a wide variety of computational science applications easier to develop and maintain.The research results will be disseminated through new and existing courses on analysis of algorithms, parallel programming and supercomputing using resources made available through the NSF-funded XSEDE program, as well as workshops targeting both computer science and computational science audiences."

By learning the relationships between syllables and words, or scientific and mathematical concepts, we produce language, form lexical knowledge, develop physical intuition, exercise logical deduction, and attain expertise in our line of work. Collectively, these relational data can be described as a graph in which nodes might represent syllables or concepts, and edges might represent shared content or conditional probabilities. Yet, how the organization of such a graph impacts our ability to learn the data or the neural processes that affect learning is far from understood. In this project the PI will use network science as a mathematical framework within which she will study the human learning of relational patterns, and answer the question of whether graphs that are complex in the mathematical or naturalistic senses are more or less difficult to learn, or require different neural processes. To facilitate broader impacts, these efforts incorporate art to transform STEM to STEAM, a recent international innovation that improves long-term retention of content and scientific reasoning. The goals of this program are (i) to create a local community - from preschoolers to adults - who are generally inspired by cutting edge science, and who more specifically appreciate the concepts of network architectures in natural information and in their brain?s ability to learn that information, (ii) to produce undergraduate and graduate students trained at the interdisciplinary boundary between network science and neuroscience to address critical and timely scientific questions that transcend national boundaries, (iii) to develop course material that incorporates these timely research questions, and (iv) to polish and release teaching materials developed in these aims to international and global collaborators, and to the public. The PI complements these efforts with extensive mentorship for women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, and with educational outreach efforts in under-served inner-city Philadelphia schools.<br/><br/>In particular the PI will use a 3-pronged approach that employs (i) engineering-based tools from network science to systematically define graph ensembles of relational information with dissociable topologies, (ii) behavioral studies to determine which graph topologies are easier or harder to learn, and (iii) functional neuroimaging to identify predictors of individual differences in learning. Exploratory work seeks to translate the knowledge gained in these areas to instructed learning of scientific concepts. In this proposal, the PI brings together her background in theoretical physics and network science, her expertise in multimodal human neuroimaging, her current research program intersecting engineering and cognitive neuroscience, and her recently developed methods to predict individual differences in learning from the dynamics of human brain functional connectivity to determine how the graph topology of relational information maps to individual differences in human learning behavior as produced by dissociable neurophysiological processes."

The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa was a reminder that the world is ill-prepared for a severe disease epidemic or any similar global sustained public emergency. The risk of future global severe infectious disease outbreaks in an increasingly connected world is greater than ever. The workshop will explore how mathematical models can be used to understand and forecast disease transmission dynamics and to evaluate the effect of different interventions and changing on-the-ground conditions on epidemiological outcomes. The workshop will concentrate on the responses to the recent Ebola outbreak, while gaining insight from responses to HIV/AIDS and other epidemics within individual countries. To enhance local engagement, a mini-symposium at the University Cheikh anta Diop of Dakar is also planned. <br/><br/>Though modelers have analyzed ongoing epidemics before, such as the 2003 SARS and 2009 Swine Flu epidemics, their response to the recent Ebola outbreak enabled by online availability of epidemiological data, from WHO and health ministries of the most affected countries, was unprecedented in magnitude. Lessons learned from this outbreak will be fundamental for improving the application for epidemiological modeling during outbreak of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, engaging public awareness on the importance of epidemiological modeling, and improving interaction between public health authorities and modelers to the end of using mathematical/computational models to inform preparedness strategies to mitigate future epidemics. The satellite workshop and mini-symposium will catalyze collaborations among modelers and policy makers in the US and Africa. Bringing together scientists from Africa and the US should lead them to be better prepared to collaborate on the intertwined problems posed for our societies by the threats of disease. Not only will this enable US researchers to gain better understanding of routes of disease transmission and effects of government policies in Africa, it will also expose them to the modeling efforts in Africa and provide contacts for data and interpretation.

New algorithms and tools will need to be developed to enable computation of the complex questions inherent in designing such a system while proving adherence to rigorous safety standards. Researchers must develop the tools of formal analysis to be able to address the UAS in the NAS problem, reason about UAS integration during the design phase of NextGen, and tie this design to on-board capabilities to provide runtime System Health Management (SHM), ensuring the safety of people and property on the ground.

This project bridges that gap, integrating new UAS and air traffic control designs with advances in formal analysis. Within the wealth of promising directions for autonomous UAS capabilities, this project fills a unique need, providing a direct synergy between on-board UAS SHM, the NAS environment in which they must operate, and the theoretical foundations common to both of these.<br/><br/>This research will help to build a safer NAS with increased capacity for UAS and create broadly impactful capabilities for SHM on-board UAS. Advancements will require theoretical research into more scalable model checking and debugging of safety properties. Safety properties express the sentiment that ""something bad does not happen"" during any system execution; they represent the vast majority of the requirements for NextGen designs and all requirements researchers can monitor on-board a UAS for system heath management during runtime. This research will tackle new frontiers in embedding health management capabilities on-board UAS. Collaborations with aerospace system designers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and tool designers at the Bruno Kessler Foundation will aid real-life utility and technology transfer. Broader impact will be achieved by involving undergraduate students in the design of an open-source, affordable, all-COTS and 3D-printable UAS, which will facilitate flight testing of this project's research advances. An open-UAS design for academia will be useful both for classroom demonstrations and as a research platform. Further impact will be achieved by using this UAS and the research it enables in interactive teaching experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students and in mentoring outreach specifically targeted at girls achieving in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects."

Robotic surgical procedures promise decreased complication rates and morbidity, due to the minimally invasive nature of the procedures.  A detailed analysis (also reported to the FDA) of the adverse events associated with the surgical robot indicates that despite the increased number of robotic procedures and their greater utilization, the rate of adverse events has remained relatively steady over the last 14 years. Even though current surgical robots are designed with safety mechanisms in mind, in practice several significant challenges exist in enabling timely and accurate detection and mitigation of adverse incidents during surgery. Toward this goal, the project will address (i) an in-depth analysis of incident causes, which takes into account the interactions among the system components, human operators, and patients; (ii) resiliency assessment of the robotic systems in the presence of realistic safety hazards, reliability failures, and malicious tampering; and (iii) continuous monitoring for detection of safety, reliability, and security violations to ensure patient safety.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work lies in: (i) systems-theoretic approach driven by real data on safety hazards and medical equipment recalls, to identify causes leading to violation of safety constraints at different layers of the cyber and physical system-control-structure; (ii) creation of a unique safety hazard simulation engine to perform injections into robot control software and emulate realistic safety hazard scenarios in a virtual environment; (iii) an adaptive method for rapid detection of events that lead to safety violations, based on continuous monitoring of human operator actions, robot state, and patient status, in conjunction with a probabilistic graph-model that captures dependencies between the causal factors leading to safety hazards; and (iv) experimental validation using the real robot to assess monitoring and protection mechanisms in the presence of realistic safety hazards, reliability faults, and security exploits (recreated using safety hazard simulation engine). The broader impact of the project is a methodology for design and resiliency assessment of a larger class of control cyber-physical systems, which involve humans in the on-line decision making loop. Application of the methodology to robot-assisted surgery demonstrates the strength and practicality of the approach and is likely to attract interest from areas of academia and industry in which cyber-physical systems are either a subject of study or the basis for delivering a service (e.g., transportation or electric power grids). This project's educational outreach encompasses strategies for broadening participation in multi-disciplinary projects spanning medicine and engineering."

This improvement is created using a nanoscale glass coating that increases transmittance of single side coated solar PV glass and creates an antifogging and self-cleaning surface.  These savings increase with photovoltaic device efficiencies as well, so as the next generation of solar cells will see even greater benefit from the proposed innovation. Reducing the cost per watt of solar generated electricity is one of the grand energy challenges and has immense societal and governmental impacts. The proposed project is one component of addressing that challenge. The technical advances made in this project will also be applicable to additional market opportunities in LED lighting and other cutting-edge markets.	<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the deposition of water-based nanoparticle solutions using industrially scalable methods and results in valuable scientific knowledge that is not currently available in the field. Nanoparticle-based antireflective glass coatings have been presented in both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost, high-performance nanoparticle that were developed in the Phase I project are scaled to high throughput and low cost fabrication methods. The process/structure/property relationships of this novel coating will be investigated and lead to new scientific knowledge related to the large-scale deployment of nanoparticle based technologies. The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology at a pilot level with industry collaborators."

In addition, hematite formation in soils is of the highest environmental significance, because hematite nanoparticles can attach to the surfaces of soil particles and modify their ability to sequester harmful metals.  Hematite also is used technologically in applications ranging from magnetic data storage to pigmentation, and it is being tested as an agent for water-splitting in solar cells.  However, despite the ubiquity of hematite at Earth's surface, the chemical reactions by which hematite crystallizes are still poorly understood.  This study will explore a novel hypothesis that the first crystals of hematite to nucleate from aqueous solutions are chemically and physically distinct from ideal hematite, not only because of their nanometer-scale particle size but because up to one-third of the iron atoms are missing from the crystal structure.  Previous studies have shown that these iron defects can dramatically alter the magnetic properties, color saturation, and chemical reactivity of hematite.  In this study, the investigators will explore the relation between iron defects and the physical properties of hematite, and they will determine the connection between the abundance of defects and the temperature, pH, and oxygen content of the groundwaters from which natural hematite crystallizes.<br/><br/>The investigators hypothesize that when hematite (Fe2O3) forms from ferrihydrite and goethite in aqueous solutions, the hematite first nucleates as highly iron-deficient, hydrous nanocrystals.  These defective precursor phases are metastable and may anneal to endmember hematite with time.  The investigators base these inferences on their recent observations of crystallization sequences in ferric chloride solutions. That work revealed incipient phases of ""hydrohematite"" with a chemical formula close to FeOOH forming from precursor akaganite.  The investigators will determine whether the more common crystallization pathways for natural hematite - from antecedent ferrihydrite and goethite - experience an analogous multi-step reaction route.  In contrast to approaches based on dry heating of powders or on ""before-and-after"" characterization of batch-reacted mixtures, the investigators will exploit novel synchrotron-based techniques that allow them to capture X-ray diffraction patterns of mineral-fluid mixtures from 25 to 200 degree C with very high time resolution.  The diffraction data are amenable to Rietveld analysis and will yield high-quality cell parameters, atom positions, and occupancies.  In addition to pinpointing the evolution of hematite growth at the atomic scale, the experiments will yield kinetic models from which they can extract robust activation energies for the nucleation and growth of iron (hydr)oxides as a function of pH. The investigators will couple these experiments with detailed microscopic and spectroscopic examinations of natural and historic specimens of ""hydrohematite"", and they will perform density functional calculations to gauge the relative stabilities of hydrous hematite phases and to relate chemical properties to particle size."

DNA replication starts at ""origins of replication"" of which there are many in all the chromosomes in a cell. There are exquisite controls to ensure that each origin of replication is not activated more than once per cell cycle. When cells override these regulatory controls, regions can become re-replicated leading to gene amplification that is a hallmark of many cancers. To understand such overrides, it is important to have fundamental knowledge about the origins of replication themselves. Although several methods exist to map replication origins, their results are not in full agreement with one another. The focus of this project is to refine a new nanopore sequencing technology using the MinION sequencing device. One future application of the projected refinement is to provide a new method to map origins of replication genome-wide. There are also many other important applications as summarized below.<br/><br/>The project aims to advance the nascent technology of nanopore DNA sequencing to obtain ultra-long reads, using the MinION sequencing device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The projected experiments include: (i) improved preparation of ultra-long DNA; (ii) characterizing the signal space of the nanopore device; (iii) testing hybrid assembly methods using the MinION coupled to other methods; (iv) direct nanopore sequencing of non-amplified, single-molecule, ultra-long DNA with modified nucleotides as a platform for future experiments in DNA replication and other areas. The impact of sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules and being able to identify modified, labeled, or damaged bases is enormous and will be transformative to many scientific subfields. Development of methodology to obtain ultra-long MinION reads (up to megabase lengths) will dramatically enhance the contiguity of hybrid and non-hybrid genome assemblies, and will allow the exploration of numerous biological questions with a single molecule perspective. Ultra-long MinION reads as well as signal space operations will also allow researchers to discover the covariation of single nucleotide polymorphism (snp), chromosomal rearrangements, and base modification co variations on single molecules. There will be broad educational impact of the research, both in classroom teaching and as laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project. STEM education will be advanced by lectures in genomics and a Genomics Club organized by the graduate student funded by the grant. The PI will continue her track record to broaden participation by women and underrepresented minorities, and education of the public on biological research."

Musculoskeletal injuries include injury to the muscles, ligaments, tendons, and bone. These injuries are the primary cause of lost work days and often require physical therapy to restore proper function. If care is not taken to restore proper function following injury, one is exposed to a greater risk of re-injury. These injuries are challenging to prevent due to their multifactorial nature, however they are preventable with the right tools and knowledge. Physical therapists are able to help patients recover and restore musculoskeletal function, but it requires regular monitoring which is difficult with the decreasing number of patient visits. Even after physical therapy is completed, there is often a gap between restoring function and being able to return to full activity without risking re-injury. The proposed technology fills this gap and provides patients with a means to assess their progress in recovery and prevent future injury. The proposed technology leverages over 15 years of experience and research on injury prevention in Special Operations Forces operators and in student athletes. The Neuromuscular Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh has developed a model that has been proven effective in preventing injuries. This I-Corps team has applied these methods to develop a tool that minimizes the cost, size, effort, and expertise required to identify risk of injury and appropriate training without compromising precision or quality of these assessments. <br/><br/>The proposed technology, accelMOTION, has the potential to greatly enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness of physical therapy. The ability to accurately quantify measurements and monitor patient compliance will enable them to quickly provide more accurate and repeatable evaluations, as well as consistently manage rehabilitation and treatment outside the physical therapy clinic. This technology enables physical therapists to quickly and quantitatively assess patient characteristics with the use of a small wearable sensor. It can assess neuromuscular, physiological, biomechanical, and musculoskeletal characteristics including balance, flexibility, and task performance. The user is guided on placement of the wearable sensor and how to perform the desired assessment. The platform assesses quality of the measurement, and then uses an algorithm to derive injury risk associated with each assessment. This tool can then be used at home by the patient to monitor their progress in between physical therapy sessions. The physical therapist is easily able to track patient progress both in and out of the clinic. Training recommendations customized to the individual are developed based on the areas that may be exposing the individual to a greater risk of injury making it simple for the physical therapist to modify exercise prescriptions in between clinic visits. This unique and prospective multifactorial approach to study musculoskeletal injury has the ability to greatly enhance patient care following musculoskeletal injury."

Unfortunately, the collection and transportation of the sample can be a time-consuming task, which poses particular diculty for patients with decreased mobility. Furthermore, kidney health is crucial for quality of life. Unfortunately, health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure are risk factors in the development of chronic kidney disease. This is particularly problematic given the high incidence of obesity that the United States currently is facing. Together, diabetes and cardiovascular disease cost the United States over $370 billions per year. By monitoring kidney function more frequently, its deterioration can be detected early, allowing doctors and patients to make adjustments in treatment and lifestyle to prevent further loss of kidney functions. This is crucial given the fact that, in many cases, kidney function cannot be recovered. Additionally, the alarming rate of chronic kidney disease in adults over 65 years (25%) makes it critical to closely monitor kidney function.

The planned work will consist of joining the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model to the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM) and performing a number of simulations on three well-observed storms:  western Pacific typhoon Nuri (2008), hurricane Sandy (2012), and hurricane Humberto (2007).  The main hypotheses of the proposal are:  1) The response of a mature tropical cyclone to anthropogenic aerosols depends on the distribution of aerosols within the tropical cyclone with more aerosols entering the outer rainband region of the storm contributing to storm weakening whereas more aerosols entering the eyewall and inner rainband region contributing to storm intensification, 2) Anthropogenic aerosols ingested in a tropical disturbance, or a tropical storm, have the potential to contribute to the intensification of a storm, perhaps leading to the formation of a tropical cyclone, 3) Pollution aerosols entering a tropical cyclone undergoing transition to a cold-core system are unlikely to contribute substantially to storm intensity change, but are likely to contribute to enhanced rainfall."

As such, it is essential that we  better understand how our brains and minds enable this indispensable skill.  But, the study of how humans do language is currently undergoing major shifts.  We have unprecedented technology that allows us to investigate the brain as people produce language live.  We have developed computational tools to extract insights from major databases of produced language of all forms.  Our increasingly global society places speakers of different languages into close contact, making multilingualism more the norm than ever before.  And after decades of treating all human minds as the same, we have renewed the study of how each of us differ.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, experts from around the world will be brought together for a special session that will inform the community of scientists who study language production on these major developments in our field.  The special session, titled The State of the Art in Language Production, will be the centerpiece of the 2016 meeting of the International Workshop on Language Production, to be held in La Jolla, CA, in July, 2016.<br/><br/>The speakers were invited to the special session to bring a diversity of perspectives and experience.  Nina Dronkers, VA Research Career Scientist and Director, Center for Aphasia and Related Disorders at the VA Northern California Health Care System has for decades been conducting cutting edge work on how brain disorders affect language production.  Stefan Th. Gries, Professor of Linguistics, University of California, Santa Barbara is a mid-career expert on the computational analysis of large-scale language databases.  Gerrit Jan Kootstra, Postdoctoral Scholar, Pennsylvania State University is an early investigator with expertise in bilingual language production.  Antje Meyer, Director, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, is one of the world's leading figures on the behavioral study of language production, and has begun a comprehensive effort to understand individual differences in language production.  And Kristof Strijkers, Marie Curie (IEF) fellow at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (France) and the Laboratoire de Psychology Cognitive (Marseille) is an early investigator who uses neuroscience techniques to better understand the brain basis of language production.  Together, these presentations will bring the latest and most important insights to a worldwide interdisciplinary community of scientists who are helping us to better understand how human beings produce language."

However, the Indian Ocean may be the least studied major marine body on the planet. Our limited understanding suggests extensive variations in physical and chemical environmental conditions, but how this variation influences biodiversity, nutrient stress, and more broadly regional differences in the functioning of phytoplankton is unknown. To help address these gaps, the investigators will conduct a study by joining an already-funded major research cruise to this region. It will cover a northern region with some of the highest temperatures recorded in open ocean waters, an area around 10S of predicted (but not tested in situ) iron stress, and a southern subtropical gyre with unique nitrogen to phosphorous(or N:P) ratios. The focus of this project is to quantify and synthesize the interconnectedness of environmental conditions, phytoplankton diversity and genome content, and nutrient biogeochemistry, with the goal of understanding how these may lead to unique biogeochemical regions in Indian Ocean. The research will have broader impacts on many levels. First, it will increase public awareness of the role of phytoplankton on ocean functioning, climate, and people's lives through a new partnership with the Aquarium of the Pacific (AOP), which is the fourth most-attended aquarium in the nation. Secondly, the project will train a postdoctoral scholar as well as a graduate and undergraduate students. Third, the research will dramatically increase our basic knowledge ocean biogeochemistry and in many cases will be the first measurements of their kind made in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>This project will address two major questions: How do environmental conditions, phytoplankton diversity, phytoplankton physiology, and biogeochemistry vary across the central Indian Ocean? Are there distinct biogeochemical regimes in the central IO? The researchers hypothesize that environmental conditions, including the relative availability of nitrogen (N) and iron (Fe), lead to three distinct phytoplankton communities and biogeochemical regimes. They will employ a series of advanced analytical tools including high sensitivity measurements of dissolved and particulate nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron), genomics, bioassays to test for nutrient stress, and cell-sorting of specific taxa followed by measures of nutrient content and uptake. A focus of this project is to quantify and synthesize the interconnectedness of environmental conditions, phytoplankton diversity and genome content, and nutrient biogeochemistry, and how these lead to unique biogeochemical regions in Indian Ocean. This extensive set of observations can ultimately be linked to ocean models and satellite data to provide a comprehensive view of regional differences in chemistry, biodiversity and phytoplankton biogeochemical functioning in the Indian Ocean."

Seismic network operators routinely analyze their seismograms to estimate various parameters, including time, location, and magnitude of each new earthquake, adding to a rapidly growing archive of digital seismic data. Catalogs of earthquake locations are a fundamental source of data in seismology, and in the Earth sciences in general. Yet these individual locations have had notoriously low spatial resolution, which limits their potential to address fundamental questions concerning the structure and composition of the Earth?s interior, the nature of earthquakes, and the seismic hazards they impose on our society and the built environment. The main goal of this project is to significantly improve the location precision of millions of earthquakes on a global scale by applying higher-order earthquake location methods that take advantage of the increasing quantity and quality of seismic archives and the availability of affordable computing power. This project will focus on using the wealth of high-precision data to better understand, in a comparative way, the seismogenic structure and processes that control subduction zones worldwide. Results from this project are expected to find many applications in the Earth Sciences, and to have social impact in the areas of natural hazards and seismic verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).<br/><br/>The tremendous growth in global seismic archives over the last several decades, the continuous fall in computing costs, and advances in earthquake relocation methods provide a unique opportunity to substantially improve the spatial resolution of standard global earthquake catalogs. The locations of hypocenters in these catalogs, typically estimated one event at a time from phase arrival times observed at global seismic stations, have notoriously low accuracy that hamper studies in a wide range of research areas, not only in Seismology, but in the Geosciences in general. This continuing project builds on previous work that developed high-efficiency waveform cross-correlation and double-difference (DD) algorithms to relocate more than 3 million earthquakes listed in the combined bulletins of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) and NEIC?s Earthquake Data Report, spanning the years 1964-2012. These tools increase the precision of the earthquake locations by harnessing new procedures that can cope with the computational load of this massive-scale undertaking. Cross-correlation based phase delay times are measured on billions of pairs of waveforms, and efficient teleseismic double-difference algorithms invert these data in combination with reported phase arrival times. Initial results using this approach already reveal characteristic seismicity patterns in time and space, and provide new data that help gain insight into seismogenic processes at unprecedented resolution.  This project will focus on the fine-scale structure of Wadati-Benioff zone seismicity at subduction zones and the nature of narrow double-seismic zones, and analyze the relocated seismicity associated with recent great subduction earthquakes to better understand their structural and kinematic behavior. A global DD catalog will likely find many applications in the Earth Sciences, and may help improve our understanding of the physical processes controlling earthquakes, our ability to image the structure and composition of the Earth?s interior, and our capability to estimate the hazards imposed by large earthquakes."

Sponges feed by filtering huge volumes of seawater, providing a mechanism for recycling organic material back to the reef. A new theory has been proposed called the ""sponge-loop hypothesis"" that is potentially the most important new concept in marine ecology in many years, because it seeks to explain Darwin's Paradox: how do highly productive and diverse coral reefs grow in desert-like tropical seas? The sponge loop hypothesis proposes that sponges on coral reefs absorb the large quantities of dissolved organic carbon (molecules such as carbohydrates) that are released by seaweeds and corals and return it to the reef as particles in the form of living and dead cells, or other cellular debris. This project will use a rigorous set of techniques to test the sponge-loop hypothesis in the field on ten of the largest and most common sponges on Caribbean reefs. For each species, the contributions of particles and dissolved organic carbon to sponge nutrition will be measured, as well as the production of cellular particles in the seawater flowing out of the sponge. For selected sponge species, the concentration of dissolved organic carbon entering the sponge will be experimentally enhanced to determine the capacity of the sponge to absorb this potential food source, and to gauge its effect on the production of cellular particles. This project will provide STEM education and training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students and public outreach in the form of easily accessible educational videos. Further, this project is important for understanding the carbon cycle on coral reefs where the effects of climate change and ocean acidification may be tipping the competitive balance toward non-reef-building organisms, such as sponges. <br/><br/>The cycling of carbon from the water-column to the benthos is central to marine ecosystem function; for coral reefs, this process begins with photosynthesis by seaweeds and coral symbionts, which then exude a substantial portion of fixed carbon as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that may be lost to currents and tides. But if sponges, with their enormous water filtering capacity, can return DOC from the water column to the reef, it would represent a major unrecognized source of carbon cycling. The ""sponge-loop hypothesis"" has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling on coral reefs. Building on preliminary data from studies of the giant barrel sponge, this project will investigate each of the three components of the sponge-loop hypothesis for ten common barrel, vase and tube-forming species that span a range of associations with microbial symbionts, from high microbial abundance (HMA) to low microbial abundance (LMA) in the sponge tissue. Specifically, the experimental approach will include InEx techniques (comparative sampling of seawater immediately before and after passage through the sponge), velocimetry, and flow cytometry to determine whether each species consumes DOC and produces particulate organic carbon (POC) in the form of cellular detritus. Then, for species that consume DOC, the same techniques will be used in manipulative experiments that augment the amount of DOC from three categories (labile, semi-labile and refractory) to determine the types of DOC consumed by sponges. In addition to testing the sponge-loop hypothesis, this project will use molecular techniques to investigate the differences among HMA and LMA sponge species, targeting the microbial symbionts that may be responsible for DOC uptake."

Breast and ovarian cancer (BOC) genetic testing in the U.S. has recently undergone dramatic changes. The standard initial screening offered to patients has expanded from a test for high-risk mutations on two genes to a test for mutations on as many as 29 genes, many of which pose only a low or moderate risk of developing cancer. Through 12 months of fieldwork combining document analysis, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with health professionals and mutation carriers, this study will investigate the following three key questions. How is BOC genetic risk made visible in the era of multi-gene panel testing? How is genetic risk information understood and acted upon by diverse carriers of BOC mutations? Finally, how are relationships among and between laboratory researchers, medical experts, and patients being transformed by the utilization of multi-gene panel tests? Examining these questions will help to reveal the social and structural dimensions of risk and genetic medicine. The proposed study will broaden and deepen understandings of the personal, clinical, and societal implications of the recent expansions of genetic testing. Its findings might also aid patients in medical decision-making and enhance broader public literacy in genetic biomedicine.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This project brings STS frameworks to the study of risk. Using tools and theoretical frameworks from science and technology studies (STS), medical sociology, and gender studies, this project aims to understand how these recent shifts in the practices of genetic medicine are shaping the active construction of risk, beliefs and communication about risk, risk identities, and risk management decisions. It aims to examine how certain ideas about genetic risk gain credibility over others; how genetic risk is actively produced, not just discovered; and how social and cultural values are embedded in genetic risk technologies and risk management guidelines. This project also presents an opportunity to empirically investigate and further develop social theories on patienthood, biomedicalization, and health citizenship. This study will also explore whether and under what circumstances patients of BOC genetic medicine--a rapidly changing field that requires highly technical and specialized knowledge--form biosocial communities and act as empowered agents in relation to medical authority."

Investigators will analyze existing data to determine how shifts in climate properties over time may have affected commercially important fishes in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  For several decades, significant relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and abundance of a broad group of marine organisms in the GOA offered some promise for incorporating environmental data into fisheries management strategies. However, many of these statistical connections deteriorated abruptly in the late 1980s, while at the same time interactions between GOA SST and other aspects of climate conditions changed as well. This study will test the hypothesis that a switch in large-scale climate variability in the 1980s led to reorganization of relationships among GOA atmospheric and oceanographic properties, which in turn, produced a change in connection between temperature and ocean biology. These types of ""no-analogue climate states"" are well recognized in paleoecology and have been anticipated as a potential outcome of climate change, but few studies of ecological response to such switches are available. The project will support a postdoctoral scientist, as well as graduate and undergraduate student researchers. It will facilitate cooperation among scientists at three public universities, a non-profit research lab, and a federal management agency in order to combine the range of expertise that will be required to carry out this research.<br/><br/>This research has the potential to transform our understanding of how climate affects marine ecosystems. It is based on preliminary analyses showing that the statistical relationships between SST and community state in the Gulf of Alaska appear to be nonstationary, with driver-response relationships that differ markedly before and after 1988/89.  Preliminary analyses also show that correlations between SST and a number of other GOA climate parameters are significantly different before and after 1988/89.  Additionally, leading modes in North Pacific SST anomalies for 1950-present changed their relative importance before and after 1988/89, with the second mode (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, or NPGO) explaining more variability than the first mode (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO) during the past three decades. This change is consistent with a switch to a no-analogue climate state, characterized by markedly different patterns of variability among basin-scale climate processes. The proposed hypothesis will be tested with a combination of statistical ecological models and numerical ocean models. The statistical approach (threshold generalized additive models) will provide formal tests for nonstationary relationships between SST variability and ecological characteristics at the community and population level using time series data (1965-present) for 17 salmon, groundfish and crustacean populations from the GOA. In addition, nonstationary relationships among atmospheric and hydrographic processes at basin and regional scales will be tested with time series generated by ocean data-assimilation and hindcast models.  Finally, those nonstationary relationships identified will be used to parameterize statistical models of biological variability that account for non-analogous states in the system."

Recently, the pH of the ocean has become more acidic which can impact nucleation, and as such, coral growth.  This research will measure nucleation rates under a variety of controlled conditions to identify the important processes controlling skeletal nucleation kinetics, namely environmental, biochemical, or some combination of the two.  Additionally, the project will merge science and education in new ways to help improve the diversity in Earth Sciences by increasing the participation of Native American students in oceanography. Partnering with an Anthropology professor at the University of Washington, the scientist will develop a class on how geology and oceanography teaches us about how the oceans have changed over time, how different cultures have adapted to these changes, and consider human?s future on a changing planet.  Four undergraduate students taking the class will be eligible for summer internships to participate in the research project.  <br/><br/>Coral skeletal nucleation is only possible if dissolved ions can overcome an energetic barrier to self-assemble into a calcified structure. The magnitude of this barrier is controlled by the aragonite saturation state and interfacial energy, meaning that nucleation is a product of both geochemical and biochemical controls that are currently not well constrained. Coral paleoproxies have been widely used to study environmental processes through deep time, and therefore, understanding of the initial step, nucleation, should greatly further understanding of the use and applicability of coral paleoproxies. The researcher's group has developed a nucleation assay to measure in vivo nucleation rates. This will be used under a variety of controlled conditions to measure the impact of the biochemical and geochemical controls on nucleation. Under the pressures of changing ocean chemistry due to ocean acidification, it is likely that nucleation rates will be greatly impacted, and it is crucial to begin developing knowledge on the magnitude of the effect ocean acidification will have on coral skeletal nucleation."

The goal of the project is to learn how to control these properties and aid in the development of artificial photosynthetic assemblies capable of converting solar energy into chemical fuels for long-term storage and use. The project addresses critical, present-day environmental and energy technology challenges at the interface of many scientific disciplines (chemistry, physics, and biology). At the high school level, four laboratory modules are being developed to complement the Virginia Standards of Learning through the full sequence and scope of the high school science program. These modules provide laboratory experiences with real-world applications to a diverse population of students and afford the opportunity for teachers to apply the curriculum to one of today's most active research fields. This component feeds into a new undergraduate course entitled ""Energy Sources of the Future,"" which promotes undergraduate research experiences, emphasizes the cross-disciplinary nature of energy science, and involves literature studies, guest lectures, and laboratory experiments.<br/><br/>Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are a class of solid-state inorganic-organic hybrid materials that combine the stability of heterogeneous materials with the synthetic diversity of molecular complexes. The research aims to discover the relationship between the molecular and three-dimensional structure of metal organic frameworks and observed electron transport properties. In this project, a series of systematically varied metal organic framework structures are explored to: (1) Elucidate the mechanism of electrochemical electron transport through MOF thin films; (2) Determine the contributions of electronic and ionic diffusion to apparent ambipolar diffusion coefficients; (3) Uncover the guiding principles to efficient photo-induced charge transport in MOF arrays. These objectives are accomplished through the correlation of structure, as determined by crystallography, to efficiency and mechanism, as measured by electrochemistry and pulsed-laser spectroscopy.

The archive will provide the capability to preserve and enable discovery of all products of NSF Arctic Science Section funded research, including data, metadata, software, documents, and provenance that link these in a coherent knowledge model, using infrastructure from the DataONE federation of data repositories.<br/><br/>This cooperative agreement will support a comprehensive archive of data from Arctic research funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences section, which necessitates a system that can handle the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of data generated in the Arctic. By building upon successful repository infrastructures that already handle these kinds of data the repository will come online at project inception, be immediately useful to researchers, and undergo continuous improvement through feature expansions and refinement. Novel features in the archive will enable critical linkages between data, science, and policy. A data science fellowship program, training workshops, and a short course will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for at least 190 graduate and undergraduate students. Selection will promote underrepresented groups with the goal to increase the diversity of data scientists in the research community. Students returning to their home universities will help communicate data science issues and will effect a large change across science disciplines nationally. In addition, the new infrastructure and data will have a lasting impact on Arctic research and policy globally. Arctic science has policy and societal importance that are disproportionally large, partly because of the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, and partly because of the resource implications on the oil, gas, and other industries that are affected by these changes. Digital research data will serve as a foundation for new insights that impact both science and society.<br/><br/>Data storage will be accomplished utilizing the UC Santa Barbara KNB Data Repository (KNB, formerly the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity) for its versioning and accessioning to enable an effective archive. Data will be replicated to administratively diverse institutions at the KNB, the Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Amazon cloud, as this is critical to long-term preservation. DataONE researcher-facing tools will be adapted to provide convenient pathways to document and archive diverse data formats as part of scientists' normal workflow. This infrastructure will be supported with an outstanding set of community services, including data discovery tools, metadata assessment and editing, data cleansing and integration, data management consulting, and user help-desk services. A data recovery team will engage the community to prioritize and rescue critical Arctic data from past NSF research that is currently inaccessible. In addition to the traditional functions of a data archive, modern cloud-based data facilities will support detailed provenance tracking of the science process, data usage and citation reporting, linkages among heterogeneous disciplines, and direct linkages between the literature, investigators, and funding programs. Usability and outreach specialists will engage an interdisciplinary Arctic Science Advisory Board and the broader polar science communities to drive continuous improvement by evaluating tools and services, gathering requirements and use cases, and prioritizing improvements to infrastructure and service offerings of the archive. Usage data and usability studies will drive an iterative cycle of assessment and development to improve operations."

As a result, re-establishing this exchange is often a primary focus of river restoration.  Even in healthy streams, expected changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events, coupled with changes in land use, may alter the exchange of nutrients and sediment between the stream and the floodplain, possibly altering riparian ecology by changing the balance of nutrient exchanges between a channel and its margins.  If the floodplain sediments are contaminated, alterations of stream-floodplain exchanges may results in the export of contaminants previously sequestered on floodplains to downstream estuaries and terminal lakes.  The objective of this project is to better understand the hydrologic controls on the exchange of sediment between streams and their floodplains so that we can predict and prepare for possible impacts of climate change on riparian ecosystems.  In addition, we will build on an outreach project developed as part of an NSF-sponsored linking graduate students with K-12 science classrooms.  The graduate student supported by this project will work with a local middle school teacher from an under-resource rural district to develop an inquiry-based project designed to increase students' understanding of, and interest in, hydrology and water resources.<br/><br/>Using a recently-developed methodology that combines measurements of the fallout radionuclides 7Be and 210Pb and the stable isotopes of hydrogen (2H) in water to quantify fine sediment connectivity during individual storm events, the investigators propose to repeatedly assess fine-grained sediment sources and the factors controlling the magnitude and direction of net channel bed-to-margin sediment flux in a gravel-bedded tributary of the Connecticut River (USA). Given sufficient discharge to mobilize suspended sediment, the investigators hypothesize that there exists a critical discharge, below which the net transfer of suspended sediment is from the bed to the margins, and above which, the net transfer is from the margins to the bed or out of the watershed. The investigators seek to determine the seasonality of this critical discharge and the sensitivity of the net transfer of suspended sediment to departure from the critical discharge. They expect that currently in natural systems net deposition onto the floodplain during discharges less than the critical value is balanced by net erosion from the floodplain during high discharge events.

A large body of research focused on networked systems has resulted where the primary goal has been the design of strategies by which individual agents in a network cooperate to achieve coordinated goals.  Less studied are competitive-strategic scenarios where agents may be competing while trying to achieve their objectives, or may be competing in teams using local communications for local coordination purposes.  This project considers the competitive-strategic domain for two opposing teams, motivated by applications that can abstractly be viewed as a competition between a large collection of autonomous agents, and an adversarial agent or team of adversaries.  A primary example is the problem of controlling a large wind farm composed of numerous turbines: each rotating blade creates a downstream wake and every turbine faces the problem of setting an appropriate rotation speed under complex aerodynamic interactions.  The cooperative control problem is to determine rotation speeds for the individual turbines that maximize the total collective energy extracted from the wind, under wake effects from neighboring turbines and difficult-to-predict variations in wind speeds and directions.  In this example, the Principal Investigators  propose to address a generalization of the problem where the turbines are viewed as competing against nature, which continually and adversarial changes the wind speed at each turbine.  Ongoing with the analytical and applications-oriented research efforts will be the development of educational programs with interdisciplinary activities in optimization, mathematical systems theory, game theory and clustering algorithms.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved, with an emphasis on attracting students from underrepresented groups to participate in the research activities throughout the duration of the project."

One such microbe is the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana that has been commercialized for pest control applications. In addition to their ability to target insects, B. bassiana is also able to form mutualistic associations with plants, resulting in increased plant growth and resistance to insects. This project seeks to understand the biological (genetic and biochemical) basis for the interactions between B. bassiana, insects, and plants. Understanding this process has important implications in beneficial versus pathogenic outcomes, environmental microbiology, and ecosystem balance. Knowledge gained from the proposal can be used to improve the efficacy and safety of using microbes for pest control and plant growth promotion. These interactions present an excellent model system for student laboratory activities relating to fundamental principles of host-parasite biology and evolution, fungal and insect physiology, symbiosis and mutualism, and application of the scientific method. The program provides resources, curriculum development, and citizen science outreach in mycology and entomology for use in K-12 classrooms and beyond. Training at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels are integrated within the scientific and outreach goals of the project.<br/><br/>Filamentous fungi are a major evolutionary branch of the eukaryotes. Several basal fungal lineages are parasites of invertebrates, and fungal-arthropod interactions represent ancient paradigms for examining pathogenesis. The filamentous fungus Beauveria bassiana is a pathogen of arthropods and forms endophytic relationships with plants. These two seemingly disparate interactions provide a tractable system with which to test and challenge some basic concepts regarding the evolution and persistence of mutualism and parasitism. Our central hypothesis is that in B. bassiana, mutualism and parasitism share underlying molecular determinants. To test this, our research aims to (a) perform a comparative molecular and biochemical analysis between the pathogenic insect interaction and the mutualistic plant interaction, emphasizing the transcriptional and regulatory networks involved, and (b) uncover additional molecular determinants of B. bassiana insect virulence and plant mutualism and examine their respective cross-contributions. This work would provide insight into the factors that contribute to trade-offs that occur during the  establishment and/or maintenance of pathogenic versus mutualistic outcomes during organismal interactions.  These interactions can be exploited to develop novel means of increasing the pest control and/or plant growth promotion potential of the fungus. Specific knowledge gained from the proposal aid understanding of two broad areas that address how organisms maintain phenotypic plasticity and sensitivity to dramatically different environments: (a) host-pathogen interactions and host-specificity, i.e. the pathways involved in insect virulence, and (b) mutualistic interactions, characterizing the pathways leading to endophyte establishment by the fungus."

The samples to be collected are focused on, but not limited to, the Indian and the Southern Oceans. The researchers will collect and analyze samples from planned repeat hydrography Atlantic cruises over the next 5 years. The total planned sampling will help provide an updated estimate of the three dimensional radiocarbon distribution for the Indian Ocean in addition to monitoring changes in the bomb-14C transient. Their repeat sampling schedule is, by design, a bit slower than for the general Repeat Hydrography program. This reduction is a compromise based on budgetary considerations, sample analysis capacity and cruise plans. They will also sample in the Southern Ocean as part of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) effort. These samples will document the radiocarbon distribution in this poorly understood region of the ocean and provide important information about carbon flux and transport through this area."

These magmas can ascend, and each year on Earth, about 30 cubic kilometers erupts or stalls, much of it within a few thousand meters of the surface. Transport and storage of magma in the crust (uppermost layer of the solid Earth) is associated with the formation of many strategically- and economically-important mineral resources including gold, platinum, chromium, diamonds and other gemstones and represents a source of untapped green energy called geothermal heat. The research carried out in this study advances infrastructural knowledge of how magmas evolve chemically and thermally through interactions with crust and as they cool, mix, and eventually solidify. Because all magmas initially contain small amounts of dissolved water and carbon dioxide, as magma cools and crystallizes, it often becomes a bubbly mixture containing high-pressure fugitive gas that can produce explosive eruptions, thereby posing risks to humans, property and ecosystems. This research seeks to better understand these phenomena based on the latest results from condensed matter physics, fluid mechanics, and chemical thermodynamics, all in the context of complex system behavior.<br/><br/>Magma emplaced in the crust is a classic example of a complex, open system where magmas and crustal host rock exchange material and energy. The thermochemical evolution of magma subject to this exchange is responsible for much of the compositional diversity observed on Earth. This research applies chemical thermodynamics to predict from first-principles the products of magma crystallization and to relate these products to the amount of geothermal energy that flows to the environment. Open system magmatic behavior that emphasizes the consequences of complete blending of two distinct magma batches (a process called magma mixing) is modeled using two mass and energy constrained computational tools: an exploratory model that utilizes simplified mixing thermodynamics and a more complex model, called the Magma Chamber Simulator, that employs state of the art thermodynamics. Simulations using these codes will generate a theoretical magma mixing taxonomy that will classify thermal and chemical characteristics of mixing end-members and products. This taxonomy will be tested by applying it to carefully chosen volcanic and plutonic rock suites that show clear evidence of magma mixing. Analysis of mixed magma products will define mass and thermal consequences of mixing that can be used to refine models of eruption, magma emplacement, and mass and energy exchange from deeper to shallower levels in Earth. Both computer codes will be enhanced to better capture the open-system characteristics identified by these studies, and public distribution of these computer resources to the earth and planetary sciences community will augment computational analysis of magma formation and evolution. The ultimate end product of this research will be enhanced understanding of the transport, storage, and eruption of molten rock, an integral part of the planetary plate tectonic recycling process."

Low-temperature compression-ignition engines represent a new class of internal combustion engines that could meet the stringent and imminent fuel economy requirements. Engineers typically add additives to the fuel to improve the engine performance. The most commonly used additive contains nitrogen, yet the fate of fuel-bound nitrogen in low-temperature combustion is poorly understood. Although some of the ultimate combustion byproducts formed by nitrogen-containing additives in these engines may be comparatively benign, other byproducts are highly toxic, and the relative yield of these toxic byproducts is not known. The goal of this proposal is to discover the fate of fuel-bound nitrogen in advanced engines. Over the course of five years, the PI will combine novel experimental, theoretical, and modeling techniques to provide quantitative measurements and kinetic predictions for the combustion byproducts of nitrogen-containing additives under engine-relevant conditions. This research will provide engineers with the tools to quantify the interactions between additives and transportation fuels in internal combustion engines, and to predict how changes to the additive, the fuel, or the engine will affect the emissions. Additionally, this research will benefit atmospheric chemists by improving their forecasts of smog and related problems. Finally, the PI will develop a series of educational modules that illustrate how changing the structure of a fuel changes its combustion properties, and will create hands-on design projects in which students build different combustion devices.<br/><br/>The most widely used fuel additive in low-temperature compression-ignition engines is 2-ethyl-hexyl nitrate (2EHN). The hypothesis is that a significant percentage of the nitrogen in 2EHN exits the cylinder as hydrogen cyanide and other highly toxic compounds. To test this hypothesis, shock tube experiments, electronic structure theory, and kinetic modeling studies will be combined to quantify the various nitrogen containing products and establish the reaction pathways that produce them. Additionally, the PI will collaborate with engineers at Argonne National Laboratory to develop computational models to predict how 2EHN will interact with real-world transportation fuels, such as n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene. Many key pathways in low-temperature compression-ignition engines are kinetically controlled, so these engines produce different combustion byproducts than conventional, high-temperature engines. Knowledge of these pathways is particularly important for fuel additives that contain nitrogen. The majority of our understanding of nitrogen chemistry is limited either to high temperatures in excess of the thermal NOx limit, or low temperatures in the atmosphere. This proposal will fill in a crucial gap in our understanding of nitrogen chemistry by elucidating the key chemical pathways for the oxidation and reduction of nitrogen containing species below the thermal NOx threshold."

Investigators will analyze existing data to determine how shifts in climate properties over time may have affected commercially important fishes in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  For several decades, significant relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and abundance of a broad group of marine organisms in the GOA offered some promise for incorporating environmental data into fisheries management strategies. However, many of these statistical connections deteriorated abruptly in the late 1980s, while at the same time interactions between GOA SST and other aspects of climate conditions changed as well. This study will test the hypothesis that a switch in large-scale climate variability in the 1980s led to reorganization of relationships among GOA atmospheric and oceanographic properties, which in turn, produced a change in connection between temperature and ocean biology. These types of ""no-analogue climate states"" are well recognized in paleoecology and have been anticipated as a potential outcome of climate change, but few studies of ecological response to such switches are available. The project will support a postdoctoral scientist, as well as graduate and undergraduate student researchers. It will facilitate cooperation among scientists at three public universities, a non-profit research lab, and a federal management agency in order to combine the range of expertise that will be required to carry out this research.<br/><br/>This research has the potential to transform our understanding of how climate affects marine ecosystems. It is based on preliminary analyses showing that the statistical relationships between SST and community state in the Gulf of Alaska appear to be nonstationary, with driver-response relationships that differ markedly before and after 1988/89.  Preliminary analyses also show that correlations between SST and a number of other GOA climate parameters are significantly different before and after 1988/89.  Additionally, leading modes in North Pacific SST anomalies for 1950-present changed their relative importance before and after 1988/89, with the second mode (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, or NPGO) explaining more variability than the first mode (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO) during the past three decades. This change is consistent with a switch to a no-analogue climate state, characterized by markedly different patterns of variability among basin-scale climate processes. The proposed hypothesis will be tested with a combination of statistical ecological models and numerical ocean models. The statistical approach (threshold generalized additive models) will provide formal tests for nonstationary relationships between SST variability and ecological characteristics at the community and population level using time series data (1965-present) for 17 salmon, groundfish and crustacean populations from the GOA.

These catalyst materials are unique in that the catalytically active metal is atomically dispersed in a rigid crystalline matrix.  This imparts unparalleled thermal stability, even at temperatures in excess of 1000C.  Conventional catalysts typically require much higher precious metal loadings (as much as 20 times) to achieve the same activity as the materials developed in this project and at high temperatures those active metals can agglomerate into large clusters reducing their performance and the lifetime of the catalyst.  The series of catalysts developed in this project are designed in a way that all precious metal is optimally utilized and protected.  This includes resistance from sulfur poisoning and the accumulation of carbon when operating under severe conditions.  This makes these materials ideal for high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming for hydrogen generation, autothermal reforming for syngas production, syngas generation in oxygen transport membranes (OTM), and exhaust oxidation in automotive catalytic convertors.     <br/><br/>The objectives of this Phase II STTR program are to build on the success of the Phase I objectives that developed a low cost and continuous catalyst manufacturing method for producing the pyrochlore powders that are the basis for the proposed catalyst product.  The method may be equally effective for producing other types of mixed metal oxides like perovskites and fluorites. In Phase II, PCC will construct and test a scaled-up production platform, following the design elements of the proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  The new unit will be designed to manufacture proprietary pyrochlore powders at a rate with a hundred-fold increase over production rates of the Phase I unit.  The Phase II technical efforts also examine a range of catalyst synthesis parameters like oxidant gas concentration/composition, temperature distribution in the production unit, precursor residence times, synthesis solution chemistry, and optimizing heat and mass transport.  Through a subaward, powders produced from the process will be characterized and tested for activity by the National Energy Technology Labs, Morgantown, WV.  The overall goal of this project is the development of a high throughput / high yield manufacturing process that produces high performance catalysts for commercial sale."

While droughts, floods, and other climatological extremes are increasing in frequency and severity, human population growth and increasing affluence are exerting unprecedented demands on Earth's ecosystems for food, water, and other resources. Threats of volatility have resulted in a growing demand for timely, accurate monitoring of renewable natural resources. Similar to the development of weather satellites in the past, terrestrial-observing satellites are now capable of providing consistent, long-term records of past, current, and projected future resources. There are two principal markets for this information. Managers of crop, range, forest, and wild lands require timely geospatial monitoring of land condition in order to plan stocking, treatment, and harvest levels. Meanwhile, financial entities must monitor these same ecosystems in order to predict yields, set commodity prices and insurance premiums, and to price instruments such as catastrophe bonds. To do this, data analysts in financial (e.g., investment, insurance) and natural-resource management sectors currently rely on indirect or coarsely scaled information such as regional tables for their analyses. This I-Corps team has developed a technology to provide high-resolution monitoring from satellite data streams that will enable more responsive land management and will increase liquidity and efficiency in resource and rural land markets. When paired with desktop and mobile visualization tools, these data have the potential to give resource managers real-time access to the ""pulse of the planet"" at local, regional, and global scales.<br/><br/>The three goals of this project are to: (1) validate the value proposition through customer discovery, (2) build a minimum viable product to demonstrate to potential partners and customers, and (3) conduct beta tests with early adopters. Based on these goals and the interviews to be conducted through the NSF I-Corps Teams program, this team will focus its efforts on specific resource (e.g., agriculture, forestry, urban development) and business (management, finance, insurance) sectors. The team will then refine its minimum viable product based on the results of these interviews and develop customer relationships. The team plans to have its first customer for geospatial data products. At the end of the I-Corps Teams program, this team will decide upon the commercial viability of products and services; and if deciding to move forward, the team will provide a transition plan to do so and a demonstration of the technology for potential partners."

Sometimes the change is so large and abrupt that the ecosystem switches to an alternate state, or regime, that persists for long periods of time (i.e. decades to millennia) such as the switch between a vegetated and desert ecosystem in the Sahara.  Since regime changes may drastically alter the ecosystem goods and services provided to humankind, there is a practical as well as theoretical need to understand the conditions and drivers leading to tipping points between alternate regimes. To date, little is known about either the pre-conditions or drivers of regime change, particularly in subtidal habitats where long-term data on the ecological state of communities of interacting species prior to regime change is difficult to obtain. Most of the knowledge about tropical regime shifts in marine habitats has focused on shifts between corals and macroalgae even though these organisms represent only part of a species-rich ecosystem with many possible trajectories and outcomes of regime change. Consequently, the overarching goal of the proposed investigation is to test a conceptual model developed herein predicting how both El Nio and La Nia phases of the unusually strong 2016 ENSO (El Nio Southern Oscillation) may drive a regime shift in the Galapagos rocky subtidal at the whole community level. As the target community involves sponges as a key component, in addition to barnacles, Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA), corals, sea urchins, sea stars and predatory fish, the model tests predictions from the Sponge Reef Hypothesis (SRH), an emerging paradigm predicting that sponges may increasingly dominate space as corals decline from future climate change (representing a coral to sponge regime change).  Preliminary data indicate that counter to the SRH, sponges declined during the unusually warm temperatures at the outset of the present ENSO in Galapagos subtidal communities. However, sea urchin predation on sponges and CCA appears to have accelerated at the same time, so manipulative field experiments are proposed to rigorously test and differentiate the effects of ENSO elevated temperature on sponge mortality from the effects of enhanced sea urchin predation on sponges. These experimental results will be evaluated in the context of actual, long-term  (13-16 year) changes in the whole community obtained by quantitative re-sampling of the benthic community at 12 sites in the central Galapagos throughout the present ENSO.  Re-sampling this baseline will also enable the analysis of indicators leading up to the hypothesized regime change. Broader educational impacts of the project will transpire at all levels from high school students to graduate students and the public.<br/><br/>Although regime changes have been described as abrupt shifts to alternate, persistent states in many ecosystems in response to natural or anthropogenic drivers, research on regime change in bottom-dwelling communities of tropical oceans has largely focused on a switch from coral-dominated to macroalgal- dominated regimes. This narrow focus overlooks potential influences of the diverse assemblages of sessile invertebrates such as sponges that share space on the hard substrate of reefs with corals and could proliferate as a new regime if corals are diminished. The SRH is an emerging community ecological paradigm that posits that sponges may increasingly dominate space as corals decline from future climate change and ocean acidification, yet it has not been rigorously tested. The exceptionally strong El Nio occurring in the Galapagos Islands presents a unique opportunity evaluate the potential for climate oscillations to create regime shifts at the community level and to test the SRH because subtidal benthic community structure has been quantified at least annually since 1999 at multiple sites in the central Galapagos Islands. Recent 2015 surveys indicated significant mortality of sponges at multiple sites coincident with the present El Nio warming, counter to the SRH. However, sea urchin predation on sponges and Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA) appears to have accelerated at the same time, so manipulative field experiments are proposed to rigorously test and differentiate the effects of ENSO elevated temperature on sponge mortality from the effects of enhanced sea urchin predation on sponges. More specifically, eight main hypotheses along with four alternate hypotheses are developed and proposed from a new conceptual model predicting direct and indirect pathways of regime change in a community of CCA, sponges, barnacles, corals, sea urchins, sea stars and predatory fish. The research will be performed in the rocky subtidal at the 12 community baseline sites in the central Galapagos archipelago during four trips in 2016-2017 bracketing the El Nio and La Nia phases. The proposed combination of experimental and observational (i.e. baseline re-sampling) methods will enable a rigorous evaluation of climate-induced direct and indirect pathways of regime change in tropical benthic ecosystems."

Investigators will analyze existing data to determine how shifts in climate properties over time may have affected commercially important fishes in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  For several decades, significant relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and abundance of a broad group of marine organisms in the GOA offered some promise for incorporating environmental data into fisheries management strategies. However, many of these statistical connections deteriorated abruptly in the late 1980s, while at the same time interactions between GOA SST and other aspects of climate conditions changed as well. This study will test the hypothesis that a switch in large-scale climate variability in the 1980s led to reorganization of relationships among GOA atmospheric and oceanographic properties, which in turn, produced a change in connection between temperature and ocean biology. These types of ""no-analogue climate states"" are well recognized in paleoecology and have been anticipated as a potential outcome of climate change, but few studies of ecological response to such switches are available. The project will support a postdoctoral scientist, as well as graduate and undergraduate student researchers. It will facilitate cooperation among scientists at three public universities, a non-profit research lab, and a federal management agency in order to combine the range of expertise that will be required to carry out this research.<br/><br/>This research has the potential to transform our understanding of how climate affects marine ecosystems. It is based on preliminary analyses showing that the statistical relationships between SST and community state in the Gulf of Alaska appear to be nonstationary, with driver-response relationships that differ markedly before and after 1988/89.  Preliminary analyses also show that correlations between SST and a number of other GOA climate parameters are significantly different before and after 1988/89.  Additionally, leading modes in North Pacific SST anomalies for 1950-present changed their relative importance before and after 1988/89, with the second mode (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, or NPGO) explaining more variability than the first mode (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO) during the past three decades. This change is consistent with a switch to a no-analogue climate state, characterized by markedly different patterns of variability among basin-scale climate processes. The proposed hypothesis will be tested with a combination of statistical ecological models and numerical ocean models. The statistical approach (threshold generalized additive models) will provide formal tests for nonstationary relationships between SST variability and ecological characteristics at the community and population level using time series data (1965-present) for 17 salmon, groundfish and crustacean populations from the GOA. In addition, nonstationary relationships among atmospheric and hydrographic processes at basin and regional scales will be tested with time series generated by ocean data-assimilation and hindcast models.  Finally, those nonstationary relationships identified will be used to parameterize statistical models of biological variability that account for non-analogous states in the system."

This prevented employment of RFID in applications where large number of tags is to be read and also produces hesitations in future usage of RFID systems in Internet of Things (IoT). Yet there is large market potential. The current (in 2015), passive RFID market is over $8 billion worldwide ranging from retail industry and tracking object to health care and Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, UHF RFID field is expecting to have over $ 9.5 billion market by 2018. This market craves for increasing read rates, extending range, material compatible tags and security. The proposed solution will remedy a low read rate problem and security concerns in RFID market while extending the communication range and providing more power for advanced, smart applications. The proposed technique can be used for UHF RFID tags to increase read rates in warehouses (e.g., Walmart) and extend the range in wireless sensor networks (e.g., NASA). Considering the individual specification of these products it is expected that RFID manufactures and consumers will welcome the introduction of these products to the market. <br/><br/>The proposed work includes discovery of potential customers and their needs with respect to RFID technology. In contrast to existing work that often focuses on purely technical advancements, the proposed effort aims at refining the proposed solution for improving the performance RFID such that the customers needs are addressed. The proposed solutions aim at combining four novel approaches to developing a more efficient RFID tag including:<br/>     (1) novel RFID tag antenna design that maximizes backscatter signal by 200% over existing designs; <br/>     (2) flexible impedance matching network for loading the RFID tag antenna that allows dynamic tuning of antenna properties to compensate for mutual coupling and interference from environment; <br/>     (3) collaborative scheme where adjacent RFID tags improve communication performance by using both the antenna and impedance tuning circuitry to minimize their destructive interference and coupling; and <br/>     (4) introducing a new operation state for RFID tags in a network fashion in that tags can receive signal from the environment but they produce minimum scattering (interference) to the environment. The customer discovery will ensure that the resulting solution will be commercially viable. <br/>Furthermore, the team will develop a prototype and proof-of-concept demonstration that will target the customer needs and show the value proposition."

Current commercial storage is dominated by batteries, especially lithium ion batteries ubiquitous in cell phones, laptops, Tesla electric vehicles, etc, because they have the highest energy density by weight.  However, batteries can heat up (not desirable for medical implants), contain toxic components (as in the lead acid batteries common in electric bikes), and have safety issues (witness the string of fires in ""hoverboards"" recently).  It is worth examining other options like supercapacitors, which store energy by nonchemical, nontoxic means, can deliver electrical energy far more rapidly than batteries, and which do not heat or represent fire danger.

In the long term, they could help supply reliable and quickly discharged electrical grid storage to go hand-in-hand with intermittent energy generation from renewables so that the transfer of electricity remains stable and disruption free.

A crucial component of understanding Antarctic climate, therefore, is a more accurate representation of the abundance of supercooled liquid in clouds and of corresponding cloud-radiative interactions.<br/><br/>Leveraging down-welling radiance measurement data previously collected  with FT-IR instruments (Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometers; AERIs) at South Pole Station - (2000) , Dome C - (2003) and to be made at McMurdo Station (planned for Nov. 2015-Nov. 2016) will be used to assess the seasonal dependence of cloud properties and cloud impacts on the local surface radiative budget. Two hypotheses will be considered:<br/>1) The Antarctic radiation budget is highly sensitive to cloud properties, particularly thermodynamic phase.<br/>2) The radiative impact of supercooled liquid in Antarctic clouds is significantly influenced by the temperature dependence of the complex refractive index of water (CRI)"

Thanks to new satellite and in situ observations, powerful numerical models, and advances in theory, it is now understood that ocean mesoscale turbulence, the highly energetic, nonlinear jumble of waves, eddies, and jets which characterizes ocean currents on scales of 20-500 km, is an essential component of ocean circulation, transport, and marine ecosystems. Because this turbulence draws its energy from instabilities of the large-scale flow, its properties are themselves sensitive to changes in climate. This project seeks to answer the question: how, and on what timescales, do large-scale changes in global climate affect the properties of ocean mesoscale turbulence? As such, the proposed work has the potential to transform how the climate community views mesoscale turbulence. Because most ocean climate models are too coarse to resolve the mesoscale, the effects of mesoscale turbulence are parameterized. As a result, mesoscale turbulence is reduced to a ""parameter"" to be tuned, rather than an emergent, dynamic part of the Earth system. The project is aimed at deepening basic physical understanding of the processes that regulate the properties of mesoscale turbulence and the timescales on which these properties respond to changes in climate. Consideration of this two-way interaction will lead to a richer understanding of the role of the ocean in the climate system, opening the door to new mechanisms for climate feedbacks. The project will also lead to methodological advances in Big Data computational tools for oceanography. The curriculum development will address the need for students to develop strong computational skills and, in particular, the capability to handle Big Data, to meet the emerging challenges of 21st century science. It will also promote active learning and the use of data in the oceanography classroom. The open-source nature of the teaching materials will encourage wide adoption. Strong interaction between research and education is guaranteed, because the same tools used in the research will be incorporated into the curriculum, both evolving together throughout the project.<br/><br/>The research component of this CAREER award will examine the link between climate change, baroclinic instability, mesoscale eddy properties (kinetic energy and length scales), and mesoscale mixing, using a hierarchy of models and observations. Idealized process models will build a theoretical foundation of understanding of how changes in surface wind and buoyancy forcing lead to changes in mesoscale turbulence. Decadal variability in mesoscale statistics and baroclinic instability will also be examined in satellite and hydrographic observations. Finally, the theoretical framework and statistical analysis will be applied to global, eddy-resolving climate model simulations of greenhouse warming. To facilitate this work, Python-based computational tools for rapid data processing will be developed. These tools will be integrated into education through development of an open-source curriculum in ""Big Data Oceanography,"" in which the computational skills necessary to study global, high-resolution datasets are taught side-by-side with core ocean science concepts. These modules will be deployed and assessed in an undergraduate course and disseminated widely online and at education conferences."

Capturing the adaptivity and robustness of brain function in real-time is crucial not only for deciphering its underlying mechanisms, but also for designing neural prostheses and brain-computer interface devices with adaptive and robust performance.  Thanks to the advances in neural data acquisition technology, the process of data collection has been substantially facilitated, resulting in abundant pools of high-dimensional, dynamic, and complex data under various modalities and conditions from the nervous systems of animals and humans. The current modeling paradigm and estimation algorithms, however, face challenges in processing these data due to their ever-growing dimensions. This research addresses these challenges by providing a unified framework to efficiently utilize the abundant pools of data in order to deliver game-changing applications in systems neuroscience.<br/><br/>Converging lines of evidence in theoretical and experimental neuroscience suggest that brain activity is a distributed high-dimensional spatiotemporal process emerging from sparse dynamic structures. From a computational perspective sparsity is a key ingredient in rejecting interfering signals and achieving robustness in neural computation and information representation in the brain.  The main objective therefore is to develop a mathematically principled methodology that captures the dynamicity and sparsity of neural data in a scalable fashion with high accuracy. By focusing on the auditory system as a quintessential instance of sophisticated brain function, this research investigates several fundamental questions in systems neuroscience such as plasticity, attention, and stimulus decoding. The research is integrated with education and outreach activities including high school level hands-on workshops, undergraduate capstone projects, and interdisciplinary course development."

Past carbon cycle changes resulted in major climate shifts, environmental change, and extinction. By understanding ancient terrestrial carbon cycle perturbations, we can understand the consequences to ongoing disruptions to the carbon cycle. This project will determine if the Cretaceous carbon cycle disruptions resulted in temperature and precipitation changes on land. To achieve these scientific goals, funds will go toward supporting community college, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students as well as creating educational lab activities. As a Career award, the PI will develop collaborations with other universities, enhance her education activities and integrate these with a strong research program for professional development that will provide a solid base for future research.<br/><br/>This project spans the late Aptian to early Albian (approximately 115 to 110 million year ago), and specifically targets carbon isotope excursions associated with ocean anoxic event 1b from 4 localities (Utah, Texas, Spain, and China).

As more information is collected, classical approaches for inference and learning are insufficient, as additional concerns arise?computational resources, privacy considerations, storage limitations, network communication constraints? outside of statistical accuracy. This prompts a basic question: how can multiple criteria be balanced while maintaining statistical performance?<br/><br/>To bring statistics and machine learning into closer contact with other desiderata, this research involves the development of procedures that trade between scarce resources in principled and optimal ways. Such trade-offs have been difficult to characterize, as current tools for providing fundamental limits (such as information theory in communication) do not connect disparate areas. Three concrete sub-areas serve as bases for this research. The investigators study the interplay of computing with learning, estimation, and optimization by connecting notions of computation?such as memory accesses or synchronization in distributed systems?to data analysis tasks. Second, the research investigates adaptive and robust procedures?and associated statistical costs?that will become more important given increasingly long-tailed and messy data. Thirdly, the investigators study privacy in estimation, using information and decision-theoretic tools to characterize the tensions between statistical accuracy and sensitive data disclosures. Combined, these lay the groundwork for a theory on the use of data in the face of constraints, along with a functional and practical understanding of procedures that balance scarce resources against statistical accuracy."

Access to individualized instruction by teachers or qualified tutors is limited for a vast number of students, particularly in disadvantaged areas and for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.  Computer-based teaching technology could meet this demand, but currently relies on indirect inferences of a student's state, and therefore lacks some of the key abilities of human teachers to assess a student during a lesson.  This project will address this challenge by enabling the tutoring system to determine how hard students are thinking and their level of focus. This will be accomplished by measuring a student's brain electrical activity using a newly-developed headset designed specifically for school-aged children.  Information derived from brain activity patterns will be used to guide tutorial topic selection, difficulty of the content and the level of interactivity.  This project could lead to a significant advance in education technology by enhancing the adaptability of computer-based tutoring platforms and expanding the depth of information on student performance available to teachers and parents.  Adaptive computer-based education is now a rapidly growing market, and the technology developed in this project aims to provide companies with a unique capability to improve their products and to meet the need for truly scalable individualized tutoring.<br/><br/>The unique innovation of this project is to create a tutoring platform that closes the loop with the student by adapting its teaching strategy to the student?s cognitive state.

The goals of this project are to modify current brain-wave measurement systems for use by children and young adults, extend associated computational algorithms and validate them to an industry standard, and evaluate the effect of adding brain-based metrics to student models that are at the core of adaptive technologies.  To meet these objectives, we will perform research and development to advance technologies for brain-activity monitoring, and conduct studies with students in grades 6 through 12 who will be tutored in subjects such as math, biology and history while their brain activity is recorded.

Children who learn two or more languages exhibit what appear to be lifelong cognitive advantages relative to those who learn only one language.  In particular, bilingual children show heightened cognitive flexibility, defined as the ability to adjust their behaviors in response to changes in task demands, and inhibit their attention to irrelevant information.  Cognitive flexibility is critical to educational success.  The proposed studies will examine whether advantages in memory processing during infancy can explain bilingual children's heightened cognitive flexibility later in childhood. A better understanding of how and why bilingualism enhances cognitive flexibility will allow educators to develop pedagogical strategies to capitalize on bilingualism's protective cognitive strengths. This may be especially important for bilingual children from low income families who show an achievement gap relative to their middle class, monolingual peers.<br/><br/> Memory inference and memory flexibility will be tested in 1- and 2-year-old monolingual and bilingual children and these same children will be tested at 3- and 5-years on cognitive flexibility. Memory flexibility involves the ability to recognize similarities between objects based on how they function rather than how they look, which involves the ability to shift between cues. Memory interference occurs when competing cues disrupt memory encoding, and reduction of interference requires inhibition of conflicting cues.  It is predicted that longitudinal analyses will show that bilingual infants have greater memory flexibility and less memory interference than monolinguals, which will predict enhanced cognitive flexibility at both 3 and 5 years.  In addition, the PI is committed to training graduate and undergraduate students and will recruit bilingual students for their unique linguistic skills; the project is therefore likely to train minority students who are underrepresented in STEM fields."

The proposed project is expected to impact the $ 900 million XRF market by further accelerating the rapid adoption of this tool, which has been utilized for a variety of research and industrial applications, including: development of advanced materials, toxicology of trace metals, mapping mineral distribution in healthy and diseased biological tissues, determining efficient oil extraction methods for specific reservoirs in oil & gas, monitoring mine efficiency by analyzing mine wastes, and chemical analysis of buried structures and packaging components in the semiconductor industry. <br/><br/>Currently, achieving high spatial resolution mapping of elemental composition at the micrometer scale resolution with analysis sensitivity in the low parts per million (ppm) levels is only possible at synchrotron micro-XRFs, of which there are only a limited number of around the world, and which are often oversubscribed.  The performance of existing laboratory micro-XRF systems is largely limited - in terms of focus size, focusing efficiency, and spectral response - by the x-ray optics which are employed.  The project will permit the development of an innovative x-ray compound mirror lens which will enable a microfocus dual energy x-ray excitation beam delivery system with high analytical sensitivity to both low- and high-Z elements, large x-ray flux (up to thirty-fold better than leading systems), microns-scale spatial resolution, and large working distances (5 cm).

However reading is not a naturally occurring development.  Rather, learning to read requires instruction, training, and practice.  The goal of this funded project is to investigate how children's brains change over the course of two months of reading instruction. The present proposal capitalizes on cutting-edge measurement techniques and software algorithms that the research team has developed, to characterize the biological processes that underlie learning to read.<br/><br/>Children between six and twelve years of age will be followed longitudinally during an eight-week, intensive reading instruction program. Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements that are sensitive to changes in myelination, the creation of new tissue macromolecules, and the packing density of axons within the white matter will be used to monitor changes in brain tissue structure during learning. Functional MRI will be used to model how the computations performed by the brain's reading circuitry change in response to reading instruction. By integrating multiple measurement modalities, and sampling children of different ages, this project will determine how the brain's capacity for experience-dependent plasticity changes over the course of elementary school and whether learning can be predicted based on a model of a child's reading circuitry. Toward this end, the project tackles 3 major challenges: (1) Determine what properties of human white matter change in response to reading instruction; (2) Measure how the brain's capacity for plasticity changes over development; and (3) Model the relationship between changes in brain circuit structure and cortical computation. Understanding how the developing brain builds circuits to rapidly translate printed symbols into meaning is an important scientific challenge with implications for education and the treatment of reading disabilities. A deeper understanding of the interplay between biological and cognitive development will lead to innovative approaches to education that are tailored to a child's unique pattern of brain maturation."

Database administrators (DBAs) are required to constantly monitor, diagnose, and rectify any performance decays. Unfortunately, the manual process of debugging and diagnosing database problems is extremely tedious and non-trivial. Rather than being caused by a single slow query, performance problems can be due to a large number of concurrent and competing queries creating compounded and hard-to-isolate effects. Sudden changes in request volume, query patterns, network traffic, or data distribution can cause previously abundant resources to become scarce, and the performance to plummet.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team has developed a tool for assisting DBAs in quickly and reliably diagnosing performance problems in a database.

Continued sampling of select repeat hydrography lines as well as the collection of samples from other important regions will provide the global carbon cycle community with a robust database to test ocean general circulation models. This is particularly important based on our reliance on such models to predict the consequences of increased global carbon dioxide. <br/><br/>Data generated from this study can be used to study mixing, ventilation rates, production rates, residence times in the deep ocean, deep ocean biogeochemistry and oxygen use rates, air-sea gas exchange, thermocline ventilation rates, as a proxy for anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ocean, and to evaluate ocean general circulation model performance. The samples to be collected are focused on, but not limited to, the Indian and the Southern Oceans. The researchers will collect and analyze samples from planned repeat hydrography Atlantic cruises over the next 5 years. The total planned sampling will help provide an updated estimate of the three dimensional radiocarbon distribution for the Indian Ocean in addition to monitoring changes in the bomb-14C transient. Their repeat sampling schedule is, by design, a bit slower than for the general Repeat Hydrography program. This reduction is a compromise based on budgetary considerations, sample analysis capacity and cruise plans. They will also sample in the Southern Ocean as part of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) effort. These samples will document the radiocarbon distribution in this poorly understood region of the ocean and provide important information about carbon flux and transport through this area."

Now in its 20th year, GLOBE continues to engage a vibrant community of scientists, educators, and students through operations in more than 115 countries worldwide.  GLOBE's fundamental approach of providing students with inquiry-based, authentic scientific research experiences that are often locally-relevant builds on an extensive STEM education research base regarding effective approaches for engaging students in learning STEM concepts and pursuing careers in STEM.  The cultural diversity of the global community engaged in GLOBE, and the ability to interact with that diverse community, positions GLOBE as a compelling platform for demonstrating that ALL students have the potential for participating in and succeeding in STEM activities.  Building capacity to leverage GLOBE resources, with the goal of increasing student engagement and diversity in STEM, is a major focus of this award.<br/><br/>This award provides support to the GLOBE Implementation Office at UCAR to conduct two comprehensive training workshops for ~40 existing and new GLOBE Partners. Training of local educators on GLOBE protocols has traditionally been undertaken by the GLOBE Partners, but the resources have not been available to bring on many new Partners - especially in areas that are underserved in STEM education - or enhance the abilities of existing Partners in the use of new tools that have become available to the program.  In the five years since the last large-scale, comprehensive U.S. Partner workshop was offered, 40 new partners have joined the program and they have only received abbreviated one-on-one training.  To address new priorities within the GLOBE program related to broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM, these training workshops are being designed to model and disseminate best practices for implementing GLOBE within especially high minority population communities.  The SCALE Immersion Model for Professional Learning (SIMPL) professional development strategy is being used during the workshops to both deliver content regarding GLOBE program resources and provide an example of how Partners might improve the pedagogical training of GLOBE educators in their local communities.  The workshops are being held in April and May 2016, with one workshop being held in New Mexico for Partners from the 3 western GLOBE regions and the other being held in North Carolina for Partners from the 3 eastern GLOBE regions.  Within 12-16 months following the training workshops, the participants are expected to convene local workshops on broadening participation through GLOBE in their communities, thereby amplifying the impact of the workshops."

Ophiocordyceps is a fungus that infects zombie ants.   Infection of ant workers by thousands of these fungal cells causes the workers to leave the colony and die attached by their mandibles to plants that overhang the trails of ant colonies. There the fungus uses the dead ant bodies to produce spores that infect other ants. The manipulation is complex and spectacular given the fact that an organism without a brain controls the behavior of one with a brain. In this project the research team will use an integrative approach to ask how fungi change ants from being productive members of their colony to ""fungi in ant's clothing?"". The project will use measurement of gene expression, metabolism and tissue structure to ask how, during the 3 week period of infection, the fungi effectively take control of the ant.  This work will provide many general insights into the nature of parasitism and may have broader societal relevance because these fungi are known to be important sources of small molecules with medical relevance. The work is relevant to the broader mission of NSF to increase scientific literacy as the zombie ant system has been shown to be a very useful tool for communicating the elegance and beauty of natural systems. <br/><br/>How can a microbe control the central nervous system of an animal? Animals are intimately associated with microbes that span the symbiotic spectrum from mutualism to parasitism. In some cases, microbial parasites of animals have evolved to control animal behavior in ways that enhance parasite transmission. The zombie ants represent one prominent example.  In this system a fungal parasite (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis) has evolved a precise level of behavioral control over the ants it infects. Worker ants infected by O. unilateralis move out from their colonies at precise times of day to highly specific locations on leaves in forests, where they bite into vegetation before dying. This altered behavior provides a platform for the eventual release of spores from a long fungal stalk that grows from the cadaver of the ant. This striking system involves an organism in one kingdom of life (Fungi) that controls the behavior of an organism in another (Animalia).    How does an organism without a brain control the behavior of one with a brain?  The investigators will address this using time series infectionstudies to measure chemical changes in both the parasite and its host.  By using three different but complementary tools (serial block face scanning electron microscopy, metabolomics and transcriptomics) to examine these changes across time, the investigators hope to understand the basis of these behavioral changes."

How interior energy shapes the Earth's surface links directly to understanding the dynamics of plate tectonics. Plate tectonics stands as one of the three major scientific revolutions of the 20th century, along with quantum mechanics and relativity. As a theory it remains a kinematic one in that it describes the motion of plates at the Earth's surface but does not connect the motions directly to the forces that drive the motion.  Extending plate tectonics theory from a kinematic one to a dynamic one has been a something of a grand challenge in the geological and geophysical communities. From the inception of plate tectonics as a kinematic theory, it has been suspected that the dynamics of plate tectonics is connected to the existence of a low viscosity zone below plates - the asthenosphere. Mapping, quantifying, and seeking to bring conceptual understanding to several of the factors that tie into this long suspected connection is the theme of this work. More specifically, over the next one year cycle, the team will: A) Test the hypothesis that changes in asthenosphere structure can drive  rapid changes in plate motion of the type recently identified to have occurred on the Earth 50-100 Million years ago and B) Explore the interaction between plate tectonics and the cycling of volatiles between surface reservoirs and the Earth's deep interior (e.g., deep water cycling can effect the nature of the asthenosphere through its role on rock melting).<br/><br/>The investigators will explore the effects of a low viscosity asthenosphere on mantle dynamics. Numerical mantle convection experiments will be used to map the combined effects of a low-viscosity asthenosphere and plate boundary failure on maintaining a plate-tectonic mode of mantle convection. A specific goal will be to identify conditions that allow for rapid changes in plate motions, as have recently been inferred for the Earth's Cretaceous. Numerical work will be augmented with theoretical scaling analysis. The analysis will provide insight into energetic balances between the resistance to plate motion associated with dissipation at plate margins, within the asthenosphere, and in the bulk mantle. This will allow the PIs to link dynamic modeling to instantaneous flow studies that isolate the balance of dissipation between plate processes and the bulk mantle. That link will bring added observational constraints to bear on their results and predictions. The analysis will also be extended to model deep volatile cycling (water and carbon) within the Earth and volatile exchange from the surface to the interior of our planet over geologic time. The key feedback this introduces, relative to the role of the asthenosphere on maintaining plate tectonics, comes from the ability of volatiles to effect melting in the upper mantle, which can significantly alter the structure of the asthenosphere."

This workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary team of U.S. and African researchers to sharpen the critical research questions surrounding the FEW nexus, to outline strategies and solutions, and to offer a vision for future FEW research goals, particularly in Africa.<br/><br/>The focus on Africa is appropriate since understanding of the FEW nexus cannot possibly be complete without considering the African continent which includes 20% of the global land mass, perhaps 60% of the global arable land, is experiencing rapid deforestation and significant ecosystem degradation challenges, and has a rapidly growing and young 16% of the global population increasingly shifting from rural to urban demographics. Africa is and will increasingly be an important region for FEW nexus research and U.S. scientists need better access to the best scientists as well as key sites and facilities. It will therefore be valuable to hold this meeting in Africa to enable a larger number of African scientists to participate. In addition, the preliminary outputs of this meeting will be presented at the Next Einstein Forum, providing an opportunity for a large and influential group of policy makers and stakeholders interested in science and development in Africa to consider the FEW nexus more substantively.<br/><br/>This workshop will pursue a relatively quantitative approach to understanding the FEW nexus in Africa, considering the FEW system of systems as a large-scale space-time optimization challenge to manage the limited resources of ecosystems with the objective of securing food, energy and water via sustainable management of environmental processes. U.S. and African researchers with expertise in environmental science, ecology, hydrology, biology, agriculture, economics, cultural anthropology and geography will participate. The dialogue and resulting collaborations should improve future opportunities for US researcher to understand unique and generalizable elements of African FEW systems, appreciate existing research and resources, and prepare for future research involving collaboration with Africa.<br/><br/>This activity is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET)."

Successes in technologies like telephony and the Internet now allow an individual to reliably receive a great deal of information. Indeed, a major problem facing society today is too much information rather than too little: the problem of information overload. A wealth of information creates a scarcity of human attention and a need for engineering designs that consider both information and attention. Problems, however, are not just technical in scope but fundamentally socio-technical, with solutions requiring explicit consideration of human behavior. This early-concept exploratory research aims to understand the gain and loss of attention in communication, drawing on mathematical models of people. The plan first considers the fundamental trade-off between information rate and Bayesian surprise, a psychological measure of human attention, over timing channels and in multiple-access and multicast settings modeled after social media systems. The plan next considers the best ways to communicate when the receiver may lose attention, either by getting ""worn out"" or by not being surprised enough. Methods to obtain the best fidelity over channels that die will also be developed. the project integrates with an education/outreach plan also focused on attention, which aims to inculcate a culture of engagement in the college of the future. Educational materials for undergraduates across campus, in new courses on big data and on heroic engineering will be developed. Public outreach will draw on the proposer's media presence and IEEE initiatives.<br/><br/>The proposed work will lay new foundations for an information theory of socio-technical systems that brings mathematical rigor and concern for fundamental limits to problems and information systems that are becoming increasingly prominent in society: problems that must dispense with the assumption that humans can be abstracted away. The significance lies in the introduction of a new dimension to communication, attention, whose importance in information-theoretic terms remains untapped. This is expected to lead to novel trade-offs between information and surprise in various network settings, as well as novel formulations of communication in the presence of both noise and signal-dependent failure, providing concrete formulations of reliable communication using finite block lengths."

These magmas can ascend, and each year on Earth, about 30 cubic kilometers erupts or stalls, much of it within a few thousand meters of the surface. Transport and storage of magma in the crust (uppermost layer of the solid Earth) is associated with the formation of many strategically- and economically-important mineral resources including gold, platinum, chromium, diamonds and other gemstones and represents a source of untapped green energy called geothermal heat. The research carried out in this study advances infrastructural knowledge of how magmas evolve chemically and thermally through interactions with crust and as they cool, mix, and eventually solidify. Because all magmas initially contain small amounts of dissolved water and carbon dioxide, as magma cools and crystallizes, it often becomes a bubbly mixture containing high-pressure fugitive gas that can produce explosive eruptions, thereby posing risks to humans, property and ecosystems. This research seeks to better understand these phenomena based on the latest results from condensed matter physics, fluid mechanics, and chemical thermodynamics, all in the context of complex system behavior.<br/><br/>Magma emplaced in the crust is a classic example of a complex, open system where magmas and crustal host rock exchange material and energy. The thermochemical evolution of magma subject to this exchange is responsible for much of the compositional diversity observed on Earth. This research applies chemical thermodynamics to predict from first-principles the products of magma crystallization and to relate these products to the amount of geothermal energy that flows to the environment. Open system magmatic behavior that emphasizes the consequences of complete blending of two distinct magma batches (a process called magma mixing) is modeled using two mass and energy constrained computational tools: an exploratory model that utilizes simplified mixing thermodynamics and a more complex model, called the Magma Chamber Simulator, that employs state of the art thermodynamics. Simulations using these codes will generate a theoretical magma mixing taxonomy that will classify thermal and chemical characteristics of mixing end-members and products. This taxonomy will be tested by applying it to carefully chosen volcanic and plutonic rock suites that show clear evidence of magma mixing. Analysis of mixed magma products will define mass and thermal consequences of mixing that can be used to refine models of eruption, magma emplacement, and mass and energy exchange from deeper to shallower levels in Earth. Both computer codes will be enhanced to better capture the open-system characteristics identified by these studies, and public distribution of these computer resources to the earth and planetary sciences community will augment computational analysis of magma formation and evolution. The ultimate end product of this research will be enhanced understanding of the transport, storage, and eruption of molten rock, an integral part of the planetary plate tectonic recycling process."

However, current systems fall short of mimicking the complex organization of cells and matrix in vivo. The vision for this technology is toward the development and commercialization of more biologically-relevant models for paracrine loop signaling, particularly with regards to cancer metastasis. This I-Corps team believes that the proposed technology can be utilized in high-throughput drug screening platforms that take seconds to manufacture tissue scaffolds and only a few days of incubation to monitor cell-coupled migration effects. The team also believes that this rapid and biologically-relevant analysis method can also be applied to determine optimal drug concentrations for pharmaceutical inhibition targeting Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) for personalized medicine, in addition to other cell-coupled migration targets. <br/><br/>The technology is currently in the prototyping stage, where this I-Corps team is continuously validating this technology in the breast adenocarcinoma/macrophage system with other drugs and concentrations. The team is also exploring if this technology can be applied to other cell pair systems as a migration tool. As of yet, the team has not taken steps toward commercializing the technology. Through the I-Corps program, the team plans to make contacts with pharmaceutical companies that might be willing to use the proposed technology as a service for a trial run. The team believes that this will ultimately be the technology demonstration required as its minimum viable product. In addition, they plan on further exploring other commercialization routes, such as integrated test kits, in the future."

This project thus addresses a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience, focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while providing a solution for variations found in their disabilities. The contributions of this project include 1) the design of accessible math Apps usable by K-12 children with and without disabilities and 2) the design of apps that adapt educational content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics. Given that there are over 93 million children worldwide living with a disability and, in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free appropriate public education, there is a large potential of making both a commercial, as well as a societal, impact in this space.   <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project addresses an unmet need by developing an innovative solution to enable children with motor disabilities access to mobile devices and Apps that could engage them fully into the educational system.

Chromosomes are not only carriers of our genetic information, but are also fascinating polymer systems with an organization that allows rapid packing and unpacking during the cell cycle and easy access to genetic information for reading and copying. This study will elucidate the physical principles that govern chromosome organization, an emerging frontier in the Physics of Living Systems. The investigators will focus on the development of polymer models of human chromosomes and use these models to elucidate principles of genome organization in 3 dimensions during interphase. Recently developed experimental techniques provide a wealth of information about chromosomal interactions and reveal multiple levels of chromosome organization, each with its unique physical characteristics: at large scales, chromosomes are organized into alternating active and inactive chromatin compartments; at smaller scales these are partitioned into subdomains. Little is know about possible physical mechanisms that drive such organization at each level and how the different levels are connected. Available data provide an excellent resource for developing and testing physical models of chromosome organization, allowing us to address a fundamental question: how is DNA folded inside human chromosomes? Activities for freshmen and high school students include (1) involving high-school students in cutting-edge research in our group through the highly successful MIT PRIMES; (2) involving MIT undergraduate students in our proposed research through the MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; (3) development of a new Freshmen Seminar in Quantitative Biology, aimed at training the next generation of MIT students with an appreciation and understanding of the role of physics in living systems.<br/><br/>The PI will address many important and unexplored problems in Polymer Physics, such as the nature of non-equilibrium states that emerge upon decondensation, the role of topological constraints, and the effect of heteropolymeric interactions in formation of multiscale structures. The four specific aims of the project are (1) develop a non-equilibrium model of the polymer ensemble that characterizes a whole chromosome after decondensation from mitosis; (2) identify physical mechanisms and heteropolymeric interactions that can give rise to organization of human chromosomes into large (1-5Mb) compartments; (3) develop models of domain organization at a smaller (0.2-1Mb) level, and to elucidate heteropolymer characteristics that can underlie such organization; (4) develop a multiscale model that integrates these three levels of organization and can explain several features and characteristics of the Hi-C and microscopy data."

Prior observational and modeling studies have come to differing conclusions on whether these aerosols weaken or strengthen a storm.  The researchers hypothesize that a key factor is the location in the storm where the enhanced aerosols are introduced.   The planned work will consist of joining the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model to the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM) and performing a number of simulations on three well-observed storms:  western Pacific typhoon Nuri (2008), hurricane Sandy (2012), and hurricane Humberto (2007).  The main hypotheses of the proposal are:  1) The response of a mature tropical cyclone to anthropogenic aerosols depends on the distribution of aerosols within the tropical cyclone with more aerosols entering the outer rainband region of the storm contributing to storm weakening whereas more aerosols entering the eyewall and inner rainband region contributing to storm intensification, 2) Anthropogenic aerosols ingested in a tropical disturbance, or a tropical storm, have the potential to contribute to the intensification of a storm, perhaps leading to the formation of a tropical cyclone, 3) Pollution aerosols entering a tropical cyclone undergoing transition to a cold-core system are unlikely to contribute substantially to storm intensity change, but are likely to contribute to enhanced rainfall."

The theory will allow for networking at multiple scales, coupling across multiple temporal and spatial scales, imperfect network communications and sensors, as well as adaptive reorganization and reconfiguration of the system. Theoretical findings will be checked against available empirical data, e.g., from the decentralized network of autonomous market exchanges with its mandated sensor systems.

The availability of data from such a system provides a test-bed for the multi-agent, complex network analyses to be developed. The project will address how instabilities can be mitigated and eventually controlled. The results are set to advance understanding of CPS system dynamics, not only among academics but also practitioners and regulatory bodies.

It has since been shown that temperature determines gender in some fish and amphibians, many lizards, numerous turtles, and all crocodilians. Yet, the mechanism that converts temperature into a biological signal for male versus female development is not known. The Rhen lab has identified novel temperature sensitive genes that respond quickly to temperature change in snapping turtle embryos. These particular genes are known to turn on or turn off gene expression during embryonic development in other species by modifying chromosomal structure. Such factors are also known as epigenetic regulators and may play a role in gender determination. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms regulate expression of genes required for testis or ovary development. Ultimately, this research will advance our understanding of temperature-dependent gender determination and provide insight into the role epigenetic mechanisms play in testis and ovary development in all vertebrates. Educational activities will enhance learning through semester long projects in the classroom, improve undergraduate research experiences through extended internships of 2-3 years, and increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in biology. Outreach activities will train Rhen lab members to communicate science more effectively to the public, disseminate findings to a wider audience through production of a mini-documentary about temperature-dependent gender determination, and target a demographic that is neglected in STEM outreach through an informal class for older Americans.<br/><br/>The Rhen lab has developed the common snapping turtle as a model to study unique and conserved mechanisms of gender determination in vertebrates. The overarching hypothesis is that temperature-dependent changes in histone methylation play a key role in regulating transcriptional programs for testis versus ovary development. Experiments test the specific hypothesis that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and lysine-specific demethylase 6B regulate methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) in gonads from embryos incubated under male and female thermal regimes. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 methylates histone H3 at lysine 27. Trimethylated histone H3 (H3K27me3) is a stable epigenetic mark that represses transcription. Conversely, lysine-specific demethylase 6B allows gene expression by demethylating H3K27me3 to H3K27me2 and H3K27me1. In Aim 1, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR will be used to analyze temperature effects on H3K27 methylation at conserved gender-determining loci. In Aim 2, ChIP-Sequencing will be used to analyze temperature effects on genome-wide patterns of H3K27 methylation in embryonic gonads. In Aim 3, experiments will test whether Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and lysine-specific demethylase 6B are causally involved in gender determination by perturbing gene expression and/or using pharmacological inhibitors of these proteins. This research will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature-dependent expression of gender-determining genes. Findings will be presented in public databases, in peer-reviewed publications, and at national/international meetings."

Tracking progress by measuring changes in behavior is crucial to determine whether the treatment is working or needs to be modified. Direct observational measures, such as live or video-based scoring, are time and resource intensive, and all but impossible to implement in clinics and homes, where treatments are increasingly delivered. There are currently no standardized, objective, and reliable measures of key social behaviors that can be used in clinical settings to assess treatment outcomes in individuals with ASD. The goal of this project is to develop visual analytics tools to enable the automatic detection and quantification of social behaviors of interest from video captured by a wearable camera, a task this I-Corps team refers to as First Person Vision (FPV). In previous work, this team developed a method for automatically detecting moments when a child makes eye contact with an adult social partner by analyzing video recorded by a pair of commercially available glasses worn by the adult which had a camera embedded in the bridge over the nose. By identifying and localizing the child's head and face in the video and analyzing the image regions containing the eyes in conjunction with the head pose, the proposed algorithm can determine whether the child's gaze is directed towards the adult's eyes. The proposed approach can generate predictions for eye contact at the frame level, and can also be used to detect eye contact events from which measures of duration can be derived. <br/><br/>If properly developed, the proposed measurement approach may enable clinical providers to scale their intervention efforts, with the potential of improving the quality of life for thousands of children with autism and their families. More broadly, analytics tools for video captured from body-worn cameras (first person video) will provide new opportunities to model and analyze human behavior, create personalized records of visual experiences, and improve the treatment of a broad range of mental and physical health conditions. This team will conduct additional customer discovery in the areas of human resources training and product marketing, with the potential of expanding the focus of our analytics from gaze behavior to other social behaviors relevant to these contexts, such as facial expressions and gestures. The team also expects to develop a prototype of the hardware (wearable camera system with wide field of view) and incorporate analytic capabilities developed by our group (algorithms for automated detection of eye contact, attention to objects, gaze shifts) into the system. the proposed prototype will also include options for visualizing and reporting the results of the automated analysis back to the user."

Sepsis is currently treated with antibiotics, but this does not remove the circulating dead bacteria and fragments of their cell membranes (endotoxin), which could cause a serious immune response. One promising method to mitigate this risk involves passing a patient's blood through a device to capture circulating endotoxin, helping to stabilize the immune system and potentially to improve their prognosis. However for this application, all materials in contact with blood must be biocompatible (i.e. resist fouling or clotting, and not induce an adverse biological response). For treatment of sepsis, surfaces must also present endotoxin-binding agents in controlled orientations and at high density. These bioactive and biocompatible coatings must be inexpensive and easy to apply to a wide range of materials, including plastics used in medical devices, needles, flexible tubing, and other associated equipment. Biocompatible and bioactive coatings could have transformative impact on the safety and efficacy of treatment of sepsis, in which even a modest improvement could result in many lives and much money saved. In other biomedical applications, the technology could also impart biological activity to a variety of other household, consumer and industrial products. The integrated educational activities of this project are expected to achieve the following benefits: (a) research concepts will be incorporated into bioengineering coursework at Oregon State (OSU) and hands-on learning modules will be adapted for OSU's STEM Academy for pre-college students and (b) the PI will work with the OSU business school to provide a summer ""Entrepreneurship Boot Camp"" for the group's graduate students and faculty mentors.<br/><br/>The project's research will result in the development of high-density, non-fouling bioactive coatings (HNB's) by living polymerization from surfactant-based immobilized initiators, producing branched, hydrophilic polymer brushes on the surface. This coating, essentially an ultrathin immobilized hydrogel, will provide excellent resistance against protein adsorption and cell interactions (biocompatibility). To impart bioactivity at the hydrogel surface, a nearly-ideal bioorthogonal ligation (BOL) will be used to immobilize enzymes, peptides, polysaccharides, or other biologically active molecules at the periphery of the brush. This chemistry enables quantitative conjugation from even dilute solutions of the active molecule, allowing precise control of surface functionalization. Unreacted groups are biologically compatible and chemically inert. Economical immobilization of peptides or proteins is provided by Genetic Code Expansion (GCE), in which engineered microbes express active proteins with BOL reactive groups incorporated at genetically-controlled positions. The resulting specific immobilization of only the desired proteins from a crude cell lysate eliminates costly purification or pre-concentration steps, and guarantees that the protein is in a precisely defined orientation for maximal biological activity. Although the main objective of this work is to demonstrate biocompatible and bioactive coatings for devices to capture pathogens from blood, myriad other potential uses include safer medical devices, food processing, pharmaceutical production, active packaging, and self-cleaning fabrics, as examples."

Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.<br/><br/>The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability.

This phenomenon is the so-called deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). From the practical consideration, the DDT influences countless disasters such as explosions in power plants and mining accidents that claim hundreds of lives every year. On the other hand, the DDT can be employed, in the energetically cheapest manner, in advanced technologies such as micro-combustors and pulse-detonation engines of the next-generation hypersonic aircrafts. From the fundamental viewpoint, the DDT is an intriguing phenomenon with applications ranging from combustion and inertial confined fusion to Thermonuclear Supernovae. This project will characterize the mechanisms promoting, controlling or preventing the DDT process. Specifically, a possibility to replace a hazardous detonation in energy-efficient manufacturing with a safer alternative combustion regime will be verified. Additionally, a novel predictive tool for fire safety and DDT risk assessment will be developed. The latter is exceptionally important for West Virginia, the Principal Investigator's region where the state economy is significantly based on the coal and shale gas mining industry. The research component of this project will be integrated with an extensive educational module promoting awareness of advanced combustion research in schools and colleges. In particular, the educational module will include an on-campus annual training program organized in a partnership with the NASA-sponsored West Virginia Space Grant Consortium. The educational module will be also translated into the Concept Warehouse - an NSF-sponsored web-based instructional tool.<br/><br/>The research component will include computational endeavors and analytical efforts. It will be devoted to the interplay between several factors influencing the processes of flame acceleration and detonation triggering such as mechanistic and thermal boundary conditions of a burner, combustion instabilities, turbulence, and combustible or inert dust impurities. Specifically, the influence of the local variations of the fuel properties on the global flame propagation scenario will be scrutinized, and the properties of a newly-found, near-sonic quasi-steady deflagration regime will be identified. It will be determined if this regime is controlled by viscous effects, and if it can be an alternative to a detonation. Finally, the evolution of a methane-air-dusty fire in a coal mine will be quantified. It will be identified how the fire evolution depends on the type, size, concentration and distribution of the combustible or inert dust, the fuel parameters and the geometry of a mining passage. This will provide the knowledgebase for the novel preventive fire safety strategies."

Importantly, a critical challenge for P modeling efforts is also a critical challenge for the scientific community as a whole; namely, determining a way forward for improving our understanding of the key drivers, processes, and global change responses of the P cycle. Bringing together P experts will address this need through a more synthetic understanding and conceptualization of P cycle dynamics, integration of varied P-related data, improved process-based modeling of the P cycle, and P data-model integration.

Industry research predicts a 1000-fold increase in aggregate bandwidth demands by 2020. In spite of decades of research on improving spectrum efficiency in WiFi and cellular networks, existing techniques can only offer short-term solutions. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology in the unlicensed 60 GHz band, supported by the IEEE 802.11ad standard, has recently emerged as an alternative to legacy WiFi, promising multi-Gigabit per second throughput. The caveat, however, is the high attenuation and vulnerability to blockage of mmWave signals, due to the small wavelength. For example, the presence of a human body in the Line-of-Sight (LOS) between the transmitter and the receiver can result in a complete link outage. This project aims to implement an integrated research and education plan towards an ambitious vision of general purpose multi-Gigabit WLANs in the mmWave frequency bands that will offer always-on connectivity in home and enterprise environments but an order of magnitude higher throughput than current WiFi networks in 2.4/5 GHz bands.<br/><br/>To realize this vision, the project will develop a mmWave multi-layer WLAN architecture in a systematic, bottom-up fashion, starting with an understanding of the mmWave channel and its impact on higher layer performance and gradually moving up the layers of the network stack. Specifically, the project includes the following tasks: (i) measurement and modeling of the mmWave wireless channel, the interactions among different layers of the protocol stack, and the power consumption of mmWave network interfaces, (ii) model-driven MAC protocol design (rate and beam adaptation, adaptive frame aggregation, loss diagnosis) targeting both performance and power savings, (iii) a mmWave relay architecture for improving connectivity (in the case of human blockage), extending network coverage, and increasing wireless capacity, along with an online link measurement framework, and a set of metrics for optimal relay selection. The proposed architecture will be prototyped and evaluated on a 60 GHz testbed, consisting of a combination of off-the-shelf and proprietary hardware platforms, which will be developed as part of this project.

Tailoring active site proximity and distribution in zeolites will open new opportunities for catalytic innovation in both the environmental protection and carbon conversion areas, while also providing new insight into the chemistry of zeolite crystallization.  The research will be linked with educational and mentoring initiatives in the STEM areas for students at all levels.<br/><br/>Currently, there is little understanding of the relationships between the atomic arrangement of Al atoms in zeolites and the chemistry of the precursor solutions and gels used to synthesize them.  This work is based on the hypothesis that the distribution of catalytically-relevant isolated and paired Al sites in zeolites can be controlled by the charge density of the synthesis gel.  Isolated and paired Al sites have been shown by the principal investigator to play important roles in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx using copper (Cu)-exchanged chabazite zeolites.  The present study will develop predictive relations between synthesis gel charge density and paired Al density for a range of zeolites, establish relationships between the framework Al distribution and extraframework Cu distribution in Cu-zeolites, and determine their kinetic and mechanistic roles in the NOx SCR reaction.  Building on prior collaborative research, the PI will utilize characterization tools that provide rapid quantification of the numbers of total and paired acid sites on proton- and metal-exchanged zeolites, thereby facilitating the development of synthesis-structure-function relationships that can be used to tailor zeolites for a range of applications."

Key features of the atomic high magnetic field sensor are: (1) since the invariable response of atoms is used for the field detection, the operation of these sensors is intrinsically calibration- and drift-free, (2) the sensors exhibit high precision and a large measurement range, (3) metallic components that may be problematic with sensing magnetic fields are not present in the sensor head (all-optical signal readout), (4) the sensors have high-spatial-resolution imaging capability, and (5) the sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) effects.  High magnetic fields in the range of 1-100 Tesla are becoming increasingly important in science and engineering settings. There is growing demand for such fields at university laboratories and government-funded research facilities around the world, and for use in improved industrial processing techniques. In medicine, strong magnets continue to drive improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) products and systems.  Advances in high-magnetic-field science and applications continue to benefit directly from improvements in the detection and control of strong magnetic fields, driving demand for devices capable of sensing and measurement in different high-magnetic-field environments with ever-more stringent requirements on the device?s performance capabilities. <br/><br/>It is planned to develop a high-magnetic-field sensor with a sensor head that is electrode-free, metal-free, and based on atomic spectroscopy. The response of the Rydberg atoms to the fields to be measured is detected using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), a quantum-optics method that allows all-optical measurements of Rydberg energy levels without need for vacuum systems and particle detectors. Much of the infrastructure required for measuring strong magnetic fields using Rydberg-atom EIT (lasers, electronics, data acquisition and processing) is already present in the laboratory from previous work. The team has already prepared a setup consisting of strong permanent magnets (field about one Tesla) surrounding the spectroscopic cell. The testing will include the useful field range, the resolution and accuracy, and the detection bandwidth. It is planned to perform one or two test runs within a strong superconducting magnet that can provide 6 to 9 Tesla of magnetic field.  The team believes that the sensor technology to be developed can have distinct competitive advantages over current sensors on the market. The potential contribution of the work to science, scientific applications and eventually to the market is the development of atomic sensors for strong-magnetic-field measurement and imaging applications, with performance characteristics that address limitations of existing high-magnetic-field sensor and measurement technologies. The potential customers include national laboratories with high-magnetic-field capabilities and detection needs, such as particle colliders, plasma physics labs, and the National High Magnetic Field Lab, industrial materials manufacturers, medical MRI research and development centers, and electromagnetic compliance (EMC)/EMI testing laboratories in the aerospace, automotive, and defense industries."

We often see in the news that cyber-attacks no longer exclusively target the military or enterprise.The world is more virtual, and thus more exposed. Everyone -  from world governments to business to private citizens - demands secure communications. There are several patented methods of encryption available in the market today, most of which rely on digital schemes to encrypt and decrypt messages. Methods of attack and defense in cyberspace require constant change, similar to biological arms races between, for instance, disease and immunity. This project proposes a novel method and apparatus that can combine analog,computing, digital computing and chaos in order to generate potentially innite keys for encryption and decryption. This I-Corps team has successfully developed intellectual property and a software-only proof-of-concept of this technology. The long term vision of the invention includes building a hardware encryption device to secure peer-to-peer communication. Since the solution will ultimately be implemented in hardware, it will execute faster than current techniques of similar complexity. In summary, this invention is a novel way to perform encryption that has tremendous potential to protect both critical national infrastructure and individual privacy.<br/><br/>The proposed technology will provide software-programmable mixed-signal circuitry capable to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) very fast. By configuring the system as a digitally-tunable hybrid chaotic oscillator the device generates a stream of continuously changing keys (""infinite key""). The keys are used by the encryption/decryption algorithm at both ends of the communication. The encryption scheme relies on the synchronization of two chaotic oscillators, running separately on a hardware device which generates the same sequence of keys to recover messages. The device supports integration with industry standard encryption algorithms and can be installed on organizations using Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Most CPSs are fully integrated with computational systems with real-time requirements and limited processing resources. This team will select two or three industry (sectors) to resolve through specific applications that use the proposed technology and rank them.  The team will also conduct a market assessment and prospect interviews with potential customers in order to validate the need for the proposed technology. Eventually, these might be candidates to alpha/beta-test to validate the proposed technology."

The conference will bring together a wide range of speakers; from leading theoretical computer scientists/mathematicians through theoreticians who actively collaborate with experimentalists, to molecular biologists, biochemists and engineers whose experimental work supports development of new scientific and computing platforms. Since 1994, the conference has been held 21 times (http: //www.dna-computing.org/index.html) with alternating locations cycling every four years: North America, Europe, North America, Asia (in 2015 it was held in Boston at Harvard University). The conference is organized under the auspices of the International Society for Nanoscale Science Computing and Engineering (ISNSCE) (http://www.isnsce.org). The community has been exceedingly influential in catalyzing the development of novel fields of research such as cellular computing, applications to synthetic biology, as well as the extremely successful DNA origami technique. The main objective of this conference is (a) to advance the field of nucleic acid computing and molecular programming by bringing interdisciplinary research communities together and promoting open scientific interactions, and (b) to promote open discussions and provide opportunities for cooperation, in particular interactions between graduate students and established researchers from all countries in inciting new research developments. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Several major directions of research under the umbrella of the ""DNA Computing and Molecular Programming"" conferences are being developed and advanced: (a) Molecular computing models, (b) Foundations of self-assembly, (c) DNA nanotechnology, (d) Chemical reaction circuits, (e) Molecular robotics. The conference presents the most significant results in these topics and features the most prominent researchers in the field. Moreover, several major developments in the field have been initiated through interactions fostered by this conference such as: novel molecular computing models, strand displacement processes, DNA tiles and algorithmic self-assembly, molecular walkers.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>By bringing together leading scientists in this multidisciplinary area of research, the conference represents an exciting venue for the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Computer science, mathematics, theoretical and experimental physics, chemistry and molecular biology are among the disciplines represented. The field of DNA computing and molecular programming remains extremely open to new ideas and open access policies. Individual groups, for example, share their results long before they are being published. One of the central goals of this conference is to further foster this spirit and stimulate the open exchanges as well as to promote interaction among graduate students and recent Ph.Ds from around the world. As has been proven in the past, these interactions will result in long-lasting research collaboration, as well as promote exchange of ideas in their current research interests. The conference has an excellent track record in bringing diverse groups together. The community has been extremely successful in attracting new students as well as promoting new scientific developments and has steadily grown over the years with over 220 participants (over 90 students) in 2015. In the last 10 years, DNA nanotechnology, which was practiced in a handful of laboratories world wide, has grown to be explored in hundreds of places worldwide. A large number of these scientists have been exposed to DNA/RNA nanotechnology through scientific meetings, most notably, the above named conference.<br/><br/>International Collaboration: The conference DNA Computing and Molecular Programming is organized at the  Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich 9/4--9/8, 2016 in cooperation with Tech University in Munich (TUM).

One way to test this question is by asking whether there are temporal or spatial differences among a group of individuals with respect to their resilience to similar stressors.  This exploratory project examines whether the development of cultural (collectively produced) resources and practices for resilience vary geographically and across generations. Having a better scientific explanation for the variables that influence resilience will help scholars and policymakers understand whether these systems are sustainable or dangerously stressed.  <br/><br/>Dr. Charles Price and Dr. Dorothy Holland of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will explore elicit, record, and analyze the cultural resources that African-American men in the United States use to enable their resilience in managing the difficulties that emerge from socioeconomic inequality. Resources for resilience are defined as the cultural knowledge, strategies, identities, people, and institutional supports that Black men summon to negotiate what they see as challenges to their well-being.  The researchers will employ life narrative interviews, prompted group discussions, participant observation, ethnographic community-based tours, and personal document elicitation to document this knowledge and to determine where the men learned or developed these resources. The study will focus on comparative cohorts of young and older Black men from Hartford, Connecticut, and Greensboro, North Carolina. The research is collaborative, engaging study participants in the development of research questions, and is designed to answer social scientific questions about the importance of race and identity in African-American men's resilience and about the extent to which cultural resources are historically and spatially specific.  Ultimately, the research should advance our understanding of resilience and race in the United States. A social scientific purpose of immediate application is to determine whether Black men's individual and collective know-how for resilience can be identified and supported. In addition to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, the responds to emergent interests in durable inequalities and race in the United States, exemplified by My Brother's Keeper Task Force Report to the President (2014), and innumerable nonprofit initiatives. The research will aid researchers and stakeholders  in understanding the generational, spatial, and cultural nature of resilience in relation to Black men during current times. The research will produce knowledge useful to government agencies, scholars, and educational and clinical practitioners."

The responses of an organism to current environmental conditions can depend on conditions it experienced in the past, due to either stress (negative effects) or acclimation (positive effects).  Biologists currently lack a framework for understanding and quantifying those effects: the goal of this project is to develop and test such a framework, using the growth responses of a model system, the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta), to variable temperatures. The research integrates physiological experiments, genomics analyses and mathematical models to predict the consequences of stress and acclimation on growth, development and survival, and to test these predictions for unpredictable temperature conditions. This new framework will allow a quantitative understanding of responses of Tobacco Hornworms and other agricultural pests to variability in weather; the general framework should be applicable to most other 'cold-blooded' animals.  The project provides research training and experience for undergraduate and graduate students, and develops a new citizen science program for monitoring butterflies and moths in the piedmont region of North Carolina.<br/><br/>During the course of a single lifespan, terrestrial ectotherms often experience wide variation in temperature and other environmental factors. An individual's performance can vary with temperature, represented as a thermal performance curve (TPC), and TPCs are the basis for many models predicting organismal responses to fluctuating temperatures. However, many ectotherms exhibit time-dependent effects, including stress responses and acclimation, where the duration and order of prior temperature exposure affect organismal performance; these effects are ignored in the standard TPC approach. The studies proposed here develop and test a new framework for incorporating time-dependent effects into models of ectotherm performance, using growth rate of Manduca sexta larvae in fluctuating temperatures as a model system. The proposed studies integrate physiological experiments, functional genomic and protein analyses, and mathematical models to develop and parameterize a systems modeling framework for stress and acclimation responses, and test predictions from this model in response to stochastic variation in diurnal temperature fluctuations. The proposed research will provide the bases for a new conceptual and modeling framework for understanding and predicting the effects of variation in temperature and climate on growth and fitness of ectotherms. The project provides research training and experience for undergraduate and graduate students, and develops a new citizen science program for monitoring butterflies and moths in the piedmont region of North Carolina."

The focus is on lasers rather than more conventional means (e.g., an applied voltage, or changes in thermodynamic control variables) because lasers offer the possibility of change on an ultrafast timescale (on the order of a millionth of one billionth of a second). The Franco group investigates, for instance, the microscopic origin of the fastest existing method for the generation of currents, and the ability of lasers to turn insulating materials into transient metals. In addition to interest at a fundamental level, pushing the time limit in which electronic properties can be controlled has the potential to catalyze transformative progress in chemistry, spectroscopy, optoelectronic device design, communication through electrical signals, and any other science or technology based on electronic properties and their control. Professor Franco is impacting graduate education by redesigning the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry through active learning pedagogies. With this project, he contributes to the development of a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering workforce by creating summer research opportunities for top international undergraduate students in Chemistry at the University of Rochester.<br/><br/>Specifically, the Franco group advances the capabilities of using high and intermediate intensity ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate electronic properties and dynamics in nanoscale matter. The vision of the group is to establish structure-function relations that apply to matter driven far from equilibrium by laser fields, and to push the limit in which control of electrons is exerted. A fundamental limit that has historically hindered progress in the quantum control of electrons is the deleterious effects on the control introduced by ultrafast electronic decoherence processes arising from electron-nuclear interactions. To overcome this limit, Professor Franco and his research group: (i) Identify, model, and quantify basic mechanisms for electronic coherence loss, as a necessary step in the design of laser control scenarios that either avoid or take advantage of the decoherence. (ii) Develop novel routes for laser control of electrons based on the Dynamic Stark Effect induced by non-resonant laser fields of intermediate intensity (non-perturbative but non-ionizing) that are robust to decoherence. Together, these developments catalyze the design of novel control experiments, ultrafast opto-electronic technologies, and a new class of dynamic electronic materials with effective laser-induced properties tunable on a femtosecond timescale.  This project incorporates an integrated research and educational plan that provides students with a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary training and collaborative work at the interface between Chemistry, Physics, Nanoscience and Optics. The work impacts graduate education, through a proposed redesign of the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry by incorporating active learning pedagogies, such as flipped classrooms and peer learning problem solving sessions."

By fusing biological organisms with synthetic electronic systems, a quantum leap can be enabled in our ever-lasting engineering struggle to mimic relatively more complicated properties of biological machines, such as autonomy, intelligence, and biocomplexity observed across various length scales.

The proposed microsystem will open a physiological window to improve understanding of the physiology of small animals in their natural environment. The unique interdisciplinary and hands-on nature of this project will help us to reach out to all citizens""women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities""and train them to use bioelectronics, biophotonics, and wearable wireless physiological systems. Further, we will design other modules including presentations, show and tell displays, and design contests. We will also use these to develop a new course and lab modules.

In doing so, we can respond to the critical need for a novel minimally invasive class of systems for continuous recording of key physiological parameters in natural environments without disturbing natural behavior. To address the challenge of higher power consumption of such systems, we will (a) benefit from the advantages of subcutaneous measurements and (b) design custom front-end circuits that would reduce power consumption through multiple strategies. To enable wireless assessment of multiple physiological parameters in ultra-miniaturized form factors, the microsystems will include state-of-the-art circuit approaches, wireless power and communication systems, and sealed packaging with extruding electrodes.

The network is tightly integrated with local high-performance computing and storage systems and national cyberinfrastructure, enabling large-scale collaborative research and sharing of computational and data resources.<br/><br/>The expansion of the university's network to create a campus research network provides multiple 10-gigabit per second ports in classrooms and laboratories in eight buildings across the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg. The expansion is accomplished by deploying 48-port 10-gigabit per second Ethernet switches. Each of these switches has a 10- or 40-gigabit per second uplink. The core aggregation router connects to the campus 100-gigabit per second backbone network with multiple links for redundancy. The network provides at least a ten-fold increase in end-to-end network connectivity, making sustained high data rate connections ubiquitous between local and national computational and data resources, research laboratories, instruments, and selected classrooms."

Over the last two decades, geophysicists have expended tremendous effort in deciphering the compositional makeup, thermal structure, and seismic features of the Earth's core. Understanding the nature and dynamics of the core can deeply enhance our abilities in understanding the magnetic field generation process, the thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth's deep interior, and the formation of the Earth as a habitable planet. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program aims to investigate the elasticity and lattice dynamics of iron alloys as candidates for the inner core under high pressure and temperature conditions of the core, using multiscale state-of-the-art experimental facilities. The outcome of the proposed research is a new set of fundamental mineral physics data on density, sound velocities, and single-crystal elasticity of iron alloys under previously uncharted pressure-temperature regimes, essential for us to provide further constraints on the core's composition and dynamics. The experimental results are to be integrated to a comprehensive mineral physics database for the core, cultivating collaborations with sister disciplines such as seismology, geodynamics and geochemistry, and ultimately enhancing our profound understanding of nature and dynamics of the Earth's deepest interior. Furthermore, the involvement of student researchers in the proposed research and the development of a research and teaching facility for high-pressure mineral and materials science will initiate the 'pipeline' that helps influence and attract diverse student population, particularly traditionally underrepresented minorities, into Earth science and build diverse geoscience workforce.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to systematically measure high pressure-temperature elastic and vibrational properties of candidate iron alloys for the inner core, using synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopies combined with resistively- and laser-heated diamond anvil cell techniques, so as to address the following scientific questions: (1) How do pressure and temperature affect the elastic and vibrational properties of iron alloys under core conditions? (2) What are the alloying effects of candidate light elements on the elasticity of iron under core conditions? (3) What are the single crystal elasticities of iron alloys approaching the core conditions, for the interpretation of the inner core's seismic anisotropy and fine-scale seismic? (4) Finally, what are the likely lighter alloying components in the inner core and what would that imply for the thermochemical evolution of the core and the planet? The integrated education and outreach objective is to train a new generation of independent solid Earth geoscientists in laboratory- and synchrotron-based facilities and to offer inquiry-base learning opportunities and experience to K-16 students through the implementation of a 'Multi-Anvil Press Laboratory' (MAPLab) teaching module to geosciences curricula. The results of the project will be widely disseminated on a timely manner through national and international meetings, public lectures and outreach, and news media."

To address this, we propose an REU site in Data Intensive Scientific Computing (DISC) that will bring together undergraduates in computer science, physical sciences, and other interdisciplinary majors. Our objective is to train all participants in collaborative techniques so that they gain experience in both computing techniques and a physical science domain, as appropriate to their background. To achieve this, we have assembled a team of faculty from three distinct areas (computer science, physics, and biological sciences) that have already formed an active set of collaborations.

There are approximately 3.6 million adult and 67,000 pediatric manual wheelchair users in the United States, according to the 2012 U.S. Census. As of 2014, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center estimated that 85% of these patients experienced some level of upper extremity joint pain or injury, and research has correlated these ailments with the substantial strain of wheelchair use. Injury prevention starts with high quality, effective therapy and training based on current research. Physical therapists provide this care and rely on clinical knowledge and tools to diagnose and treat these patients. There is a need for more objective and reliable methods to evaluate and train manual wheelchair users. Currently available options, such as treadmills and bike trainers, pose safety concerns and lack the capacity to collect quantitative metrics of function, while integrated measurement systems are often cost-prohibitive. Time and financial limitations, as well as the increasing demand for their services, add to the challenges already faced by physical therapists. By investigating the needs, obstacles, and complications in the physical therapy practice, technology can be designed to maximize the impact on clinical and research outcomes in this field. Technological enhancement in this area will not only improve the quality of life of wheelchair users by reducing risk of pain and injury, but will improve daily mobility efficiency, as well as provide increased access to healthcare.<br/><br/>The Personal Wheelchair Platform (PWP) is a cost-effective and easy-to-use stationary roller system for use in physical therapy practice. It allows manual wheelchair users to wheel safely in-place, simulating over ground bilateral propulsion based on user anthropometry. Accurate biomechanical metrics, monitored and recorded by integrated hardware and software, can be used by the clinician to develop treatment and training strategies in order to increase propulsion efficiency and reduce risk of injury to the upper extremities. Originally developed as a tool to assist in wheelchair biomechanics research, this product is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between research and clinical care while improving the quality of life and mobility of these patients. PWP allows wheelchair fitting, propulsion assessment (starting, stopping, turning, and steady-state), and customized training to be completed in the demanding clinical environment, promoting mobility independence, community integration and activity participation of wheelchair users while reducing healthcare costs related to sustained pain and injury. This project proposes to complete a comprehensive assessment of the needs of the physical therapy market, specifically targeting therapists who contribute to the care of manual wheelchair users. This will be accomplished through extensive customer discovery, with interviews systematically conducted to sample a distribution of the physical therapy market across the United States. Customer acquisition and clarification of the key value propositions for a minimum viable business product will assist in furthering business model development and launching PWP to the physical therapy market."

Until recently, mechanisms did not exist to explore recombinant spider silks (rSSp) in formats other than fibers.  A recent development to solubilize rSSp in water alone has led to the discovery that these proteins are also capable of performing as adhesives.  To date silicone, Teflon, polyurethane, stainless steel and wood have been adhered with rSSp.  The testing results were impressive.  Not only did rSSp adhere the substrates together, it did so with remarkable strength.  In the case of wood, the wood would often fail before the adhered joint.  Recombinant spider silk adhesive outperformed both Elmer's wood glue and Gorilla glue.  When silicone is coated with rSSp, taking advantage of its adhesive quality, the coating did not separate from the silicone when severely bent.  With these characteristics, there are a number of potential product fields that rSSp as an adhesive could satisfy.  This I-Corps team hypothesizes that the biomedical market will be the best fit for the proposed technology with potential applications as surgical glue, coatings and others.  The team also potentially views certain industrial applications where an all-natural green adhesive could be favorably received.  <br/><br/>The team's goal of participating in the I-Corps program is to receive and implement the training necessary to interview as many potential end users, key partners, as well as points along the value chain, to understand critical pain points in the adhesives market.  The end result of these discussions will be a definition of our minimal viable product based upon our business model canvas.  Through this analysis, the decision will made to proceed with commercialization or to go back to the laboratory and refine the product.  The scope of the proposal is to validate commercialization hypotheses by conducting interviews as described above, over the course of the I-Corps cohort.  The Araknitek team will be conducting over 100 customer interviews over the 7 week period.  The team has already identified a number of adhesive product companies in the Atlanta area and is currently actively soliciting interviews to be conducted on the first day of the program.  Araknitek?s participation in this I-Corps cohort will culminate in a clear understanding of what is necessary to make an economic impact with the proposed spider silk technology."

The main problem is that the current technology, while effective at treating OSA, is cumbersome and uncomfortable, causing roughly 50% of patients to stop using treatment as directed. Left untreated, OSA increases a person's risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and other medical complications. The economic problem is that non-compliance negatively impacts the cost effectiveness of treatment. The proposed mask seeks to solve the compliance problem by providing a device that was designed to make treatment easier and more convenient for the user without sacrificing clinical effectiveness. The innovative design with no ancillary attachments leads to increased comfort, enhanced portability, and improved compliance, all at a lower price point. Increasing compliance will improve patient outcomes and the cost effectiveness of treatment, directly benefiting the patient, doctor, and health insurance provider.<br/><br/>The $4 billion worldwide respiratory OSA market is in need of a product designed to yield compliance.

From the discovery of new medical treatments to the simulation of weather and climate systems, novel scientific research directly impacts the health, well-being and security of the nation. Computer systems, and the software that runs on them, serve as a vessel to execute this research. As a result, software is now a fundamental research tool that advances science. Software must be developed sustainably with adequate maintenance, testing and growth for the purposes of ensuring the reproducibility of scientific results and to promote the growth of science. This conference brings together experts across varying scientific disciplines to share best practices for the development of scientific software. Furthermore, this conference aims to reach the next generation of scientists and researchers that develop software, serving not only as an educational experience but also as an opportunity to see how to leverage open source contributions for the purposes of career development. Since the practice of developing software sustainably is applicable to all scientific domains, this conference will have a broader impact on science as a whole. Moreover, reaching an audience of earlier-career researchers has the twofold benefit of a) being an educational experience; and b) helping solidify and promote sustainable software development for the future.<br/><br/>21st century research increasingly relies on the development of ever more sophisticated scientific software. Projects such as R, Trilinos, PETSc, and IPython have been adopted in a manifold number of disciplines and now are indispensable tool sets. The goals of the Scientific Software Days (SSD) conference are twofold: (1) To bring together scientific software communities to share best practices; (2) Share information on the latest technologies of interest to communities. For both graduate students and early career academics interested in scientific software, SSD provides a natural venue to interact with scientific software leaders from three core areas: universities, research labs, and industry. In all three areas, the combination of deep domain expertise and advanced software development skills is in high demand. This conference will be held in the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Building (POB) at the University of Texas at Austin, February 25-26, 2016. The meeting will include invited talks from both young and established developers and scientists, a poster session to showcase the work of junior researchers, as well as a panel discussion on the challenges and opportunities for developing and supporting scientific software in each of the three main career paths. Funding is included in the budget for travel and accommodations for poster session participants to support those who may not have another source of funding, and an effort will also be made to advertise to and promote the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups in these participants."

The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.<br/><br/>The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments."

One of the most difficult problems raising poultry in a traditional poultry house environment is the large concentration of ammonia gas resulting from ureic acid excreted from the birds. As birds are tightly packed within a poultry house; ammonia concentrations inside can quickly rise to dangerous levels resulting in increased mortality, decreased growth, and increased susceptibility to disease outbreaks. The motivation behind this project is to transfer an adsorbent technology originally developed for human respiratory protection to the agricultural industry. Successful technology transfer would greatly improve current ammonia mitigation methods that either rely on house ventilation, incurring ventilation and heating costs, or metal salts, many of which are corrosive, difficult to reapply, and classified as pesticides. Effective ammonia filtration within a poultry environment would remove the significant expense of external ventilation and heating costs. <br/><br/>The proposed innovation consists of a novel class of carbonaceous material called carbide derived carbons (CDCs) for adsorbing ammonia. The method to synthesize CDCs consists of selectively etching out metal atoms from particular metal carbides with chlorine gas. Our group has developed specific etching conditions to leave a tailored metal species and a very tightly defined pore size distribution within the material. The particular patent pending CDCs developed by this research group at Georgia Tech are specifically designed to capture ammonia due to its high surface area and active metal sites tuned to maximize interactions with ammonia. This team has further developed this technology to improve ammonia adsorption using lower cost precursors, aiming for true commercial viability. Both generations have been provisionally filed with US Patent Office. The goal of this project is to determine the most adaptable method for our technology, and the greatest benefits over existing methods for the agricultural industry. As opposed to current ammonia mitigation technology, the proposed materials can be fitted into the existing internal air circulation systems inside poultry houses. A non-invasive, low cost, filtration based method as opposed to the current multiple methods used for ammonia abatement would be transformative for the meat production industry."

However, mitochondria are not just any cellular component; they are the result of an ancient bacterial infection. They essentially are bacteria that permanently live in our cells; they have become part of us. Until just a few years ago, it was thought that the mitochondrion (and its partner structure in plants, the chloroplast) was unique in biology. Recent work has shown that many mitochondrion-like relationships exist in biology. Insects in particular have repeatedly developed relationships with bacteria that have taken up permanent residence in their cells. These bacteria show many similarities to mitochondria, particularly in reference to genome structure. The goal of this project is to use recent discoveries about the bacteria that live inside cicadas as a window into the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts and how they integrate with the cells in which they are found. . The work described in this project will use cutting-edge genomic experiments to accomplish these goals. This work is computationally intensive, and as such the educational component of this research will focus on teaching computer programming and its applications to Montana students at all levels. This work will have the important outcome of increasing the competitiveness of Montana students by giving them the computational tools they need to handle diverse, complex, and large sets of data. <br/><br/>Mitochondria originated only once in the history of life, a very long time ago, and the details of  their evolution remain obscure. Research into the mitochondria of diverse plants, animals, and single-celled organisms has revealed striking diversity in mitochondrial genome structure and size. Insects acquired bacterial endosymbionts much more recently than the origin of mitochondria, and so many of the features associated with the origin and establishment of the mitochondria are seen in insect endosymbionts but are less evolved. Recent work has shown that, like mitochondria, some insect endosymbionts have undergone extensive genome fragmentation and expansion. This research will use genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, molecular evolution, and field biology to provide insight into why some endosymbiotic genomes stay stable, while others diversify. This project includes activities that will teach University of Montana undergraduates and graduate students the fundamentals of computer programming using genomic data. The proposal will bring together students of biology that lack any computational background with students from the graphical arts for whom data visualization techniques are routine into a single course. These students will work collaboratively with each other to create new ways of visualizing massive genome data."

More specifically, computer science studies optimization problems when the data is at hand, and mechanism design studies optimization problems when the data is in the hands of rational players, who may strategically lie about the data in their possession if this is in their interest. The need for mechanism design arises in many contexts in both computer science and economics, such as distributed computation, auctions, social networks, healthcare, and multiagent systems at large. A player's belief about other players in a mechanism is the information he has about them: it's called ""belief"" rather than ""knowledge"" to reflect that the information may not always be correct or consistent. Players' beliefs form the basis of their reasoning, and largely affect the mechanism's structure and performance. Beliefs can be null, purely possibilistic, or purely probabilistic; but, very often, they are unstructured: a player's belief can be anywhere between a set of possibilities and a fully-fledged probability distribution. Despite the tremendous progress made in mechanism design, the vast space where players have unstructured beliefs remains highly unexplored. This project studies fundamental questions about such settings and aims at developing a theory of mechanisms for analyzing and leveraging unstructured beliefs. If successful, it will make profound contributions to both computer science and economics, and is expected to have a long-lasting impact on logic, multiagent systems, and game theory.<br/> <br/>The technical part of this project consists of two key components. On the one hand, it will establish the logical foundation for different information structures and characterize corresponding notions of rationality. On the other hand, it will develop new tools and criteria for mechanism design, and provide new mechanisms for strategic settings such as auctions. This project will establish a solid scientific foundation for mechanisms with unstructured beliefs, bring mechanism design closer to logic and epistemic game theory, and further strengthen the connections between computer science and economics. Results from this project will be broadly disseminated in computer science, economics, and operations research.

With their potential to cause regional devastation and global disaster, understanding the processes and timescales of these supervolcanoes is crucial to being able to address potential hazards. While the climactic eruptions are the main event, these are just instances that punctuate long periods of relative calm. It is during these ""resurgent"" periods that supervolcanoes recover and readjust before the next eruption cycle. Critical information about the pre- and post-climactic activity of a supervolcano is encoded during this period, yet despite decades of research, resurgence remains poorly understood. This is of concern because most hazardous calderas today are in a resurgent stage. The goal of this project is to understand the timescale, rates, duration, and mechanisms that occur at large resurgent calderas through a case study of the Toba caldera, Sumatra, the Earth's most recent supervolcano.<br/><br/>Since the climactic eruption of 2500 km^3 of magma 74 ka as the Young Toba Tuff (YTT), there is evidence of several small eruptions within the Toba caldera as well over 1 km of vertical uplift of the caldera floor to form the island of Samosir. The hypothesis that remnant magma left after the climactic eruption was the source of this resurgence will be addressed through a program of stratigraphic correlation and age dating to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of eruptions and the rate and motivating force for the uplift.  Post YTT lavas are to be dated using coupled U-series and (U/Th)/He age determinations in zircon to resolve eruption ages and the rate and duration of uplift of Samosir are to be investigated using a combination of C-14 age dating and time control through stratigraphic correlation using paleomagnetic properties of uplifted lake sediments on Samosir. Toba's relative youth is a unique advantage among large calderas and it is anticipated that this project will reveal unprecedented details of the post-climatic history and longevity of a large caldera and its magmatic system that can be used to inform more sophisticated numerical models of caldera mechanics than currently available. Furthermore, the serendipitous opportunity to address previously recalcitrant aspects of the region's geomagnetic field will attract further attention to Toba and this work. Graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in modern caldera science and associated geochronology within an international collaborative framework with colleagues in USA, Germany, Australia, and Indonesia. The science conducted will give further impetus to efforts to develop a UNESCO Geopark at Toba."

The first research goal is to develop novel complex molecular topologies using the Four-Way-Junction and advance their applications in chemical and biological studies. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed strategy allows for the construction of innovative nanostructures with diverse topologies to probe enzyme kinetics and biological processes. The synthesis of higher-order topologies encoded with various nucleic acid functionalities, on a cell-relevant size-scale, will represent a critical step in furthering the understanding of the relationship between DNA structure and function. The double stranded DNA knots will be tested as substrates for human topoisomerases, which will allow them to monitor the enzyme activity in real time. The significance of this lies in their ability to interrogate the effects on reaction rates of a range of topoisomerase drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, by measuring in real time activity of topoisomerases upon exposure to various small molecule inhibitors, information regarding the efficacy of certain therapeutics can be qualitatively measured both in vitro and in vivo. By interfacing with nucleic acid amplification technologies, the assay can be designed to operate in a wide variety of conditions in a method consistent with the goals of a high-throughput system.

This proposal seeks funds to assist early-career scientists based in the United States, including students and postdoctoral scholars, for travel to these workshops. Approximately 5 scientists will attend each workshop, for a total of 15. The INI program will provide these scientists an excellent opportunity to build international collaborations and learn about mantle melting from some of the leading Earth scientists and applied mathematicians in the world.<br/><br/><br/>Earth's mantle is almost entirely solid, but on geological timescales it convects vigorously, the well-known surface expression of this being plate tectonics. At depths up to 100 km beneath plate-tectonic boundaries (mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones), and beneath ocean islands such as Hawaii, the mantle melts, and that melt rises to the surface to feed volcanism and form new crust. Such magmatism plays a key role in the chemical evolution and dynamics of our planet. Understanding the formation and migration of melt in the mantle presents a formidable scientific and mathematical challenge. One key challenge is in bridging diverse length scales: melt lies along grain boundaries at micron scales, may focus into channels at meter scales, and migrates over 100 km. Sophisticated mathematical techniques, such as homogenization theory, are needed to map an understanding of physics at the smallest scales to plate-tectonic scales. Seismology offers a way to image melt in the mantle, but the development of new tools in inverse theory are required to extract that information. Models of melt transport are eventually cast as a series of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, which require advanced numerical techniques to solve. The INI program will bring together a broad spectrum of mathematicians and solid Earth scientists to tackle these and other fundamental challenges of melt in the mantle.

Despite the importance of these associations, there is limited understanding of basic aspects about how stable interactions between host and algal partners is achieved.  This inhibits our ability to make informed decisions about the management of vulnerable ecosystems. For example, coral reefs experience periodic bleaching events that involve the breakdown of the symbiosis and jeopardize reef health, but the process of bleaching and subsequent recovery of the host are poorly understood. To protect our valuable reef resources, greater understanding of the cellular and genetic cross-talk between symbiotic partners is required. This project will elucidate key components of the conserved genetic regulatory pathways important in host:symbiont exchanges. As changes to ocean environments occur (e.g., increasing average seawater temperatures), it is imperative that details about how hosts support symbiont populations at the cellular and genetic level are fully understood. The project has a diverse suite of planned broader impacts including training of STEM undergraduates, involvement in a pre-college summer bridge program to increase diversity in STEM, partnerships with national leaders in incorporating undergraduate research in community colleges, and high impact community based learning opportunities.<br/><br/>The research will refine understanding of host:symbiont interactions through identification of major-effect symbiosis genes and genetic pathways. The proposed work takes advantage of unique properties of marine and freshwater sponge hosts and their algal partners to identify the molecular, genetic, cellular, and physiological interactions that occur. These properties allow control over the timing of symbiont infection, so that gene expression profiles can be correlated with events involved with symbiont contact, engulfment, recognition, intracellular migration, and repopulation. In a methodologically novel way, the research will create different combinations of hosts and algal partners to explore reasons why particular hosts become suitable habitat for particular symbionts while other hosts cannot support those symbionts. The project will explore how down-regulating gene expression can change dynamics of host:symbiont interactions, and combining field-based experiments, RNAseq, and advanced physiological, microscopic, and molecular tools, the research will identify common regulatory features of those interactions. The results will increase understanding of the habitat requirements of the symbiont, and the ability of the hosts to interact with different partners. The results will also help define the scope of change in the identity of symbiotic partners. In addition to intellectual contributions in the form of publications and presentations, this project will expand educational and research opportunities for pre-college, community college, and undergraduate students, particularly those from underserved backgrounds. The proposal will support high impact practices like course-based research and community-based learning in the context of an undergraduate curriculum, as well as community outreach through a multi-disciplinary faculty learning community and civic-engaged talks."

Other, ?synthetic? languages build these expressions with more complex verbs by stacking prefixes or suffixes. However while languages can generally be described as analytic or synthetic, these modes of expression sometimes interact in ways we do not yet understand, but which will be illuminated by this dissertation project by examining their use in a particular language.<br/><br/>This dissertation project investigates the nature of word formation, focusing on the way verbs encode inflectional meanings in Ndebele, a language of Zimbabwe. This research will be conducted at two locations in Zimbabwe and involve elicitation of linguistic data from native speakers. It aims to contribute to the understanding of mechanisms that regulate the relationship between synthesis and periphrasis by investigating contrasting single verb and multi-verb constructions in Northern Ndebele. Ndebele verbs exhibit a high level of synthesis, e.g. the Ndebele counterpart of English ""It will be given"" with three verbal elements is expressed by a single verb word ""Kuzaphiwa."" At the same time, the language makes considerable use of periphrasis, in various types of multi-verbal constructions involving a series of auxiliaries or light verbs. Light verbs are auxiliary-like, expressing information found in verbal prefixes or suffixes, or even as adverbs in other languages. As such, Ndebele offers an interesting and important perspective on the study of word formation due to the abundance of both synthetic and periphrastic forms within a single language.  The dissertation will investigate this locus of cross-linguistic variation in the limits of word-internal complexity that languages allow."

The cues that stop growth are not fully understood, even in well-studied model species. Solitary bees provision their offspring, restricting the food available for larval growth. Experiments indicate that the complete consumption of these provisions induces metamorphosis. Studying the cues to metamorphosis in solitary bees provides a unique opportunity to physiologically compare individuals of the same age and size that either have or have not transitioned to metamorphosis. The proposed research will investigate (1) whether the hormonal cues underlying starvation-triggered metamorphosis in solitary bees are the same as those found in insects that metamorphose upon reaching a particular size, (2) how variation in the timing of metamorphosis predicts body size variation in natural populations and different bee species, and (3) how the determinants of adult size in bees shape differences between queens and workers in honeybees. Bee body size predicts pollination performance, and a physiological understanding of body size control has direct implications for pollinator health and performance in both natural and managed bee species, whether solitary or social. Undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will participate in this research, and K-12 learning modules on pollinator life cycles will be developed.<br/><br/>Body size is an important organismal trait that correlates with most aspects of performance and fitness. In determinant-growing organisms, body size becomes fixed at maturation; therefore the mechanisms regulating maturation also influence size variation among individuals. Insects grow as larvae until attainment of a critical weight, at which point the mechanisms regulating metamorphosis are irreversibly initiated. This established model of body size control may not be generalizable to species with larval ecologies that differ from model insect species. Preliminary data demonstrate that completely consuming the larval provision initiates metamorphosis in the solidary bee Osmia lignaria. This result challenges the existing conceptual model for insect body size by suggesting that the critical weight is not a universal trait in insects. The proposed research will address three central aims: 1) characterizing the physiological regulation of metamorphosis in the solitary bee Osmia lignaria, 2) characterizing factors determining body size variation among populations and species of solitary bees that share similar larval ecologies; and 3) testing the degree to which diet quantity contributes to caste differences in eusocial bees. These mechanisms have the potential to explain much of the body size variation observed among Hymenopterans. Finally, the proposed research will develop a mechanistically explicit understanding of body size determination for bees, which are key pollinators for natural and managed ecosystems. A deeper, mechanistic understanding of body size variation may yield insights into improving pollinator health at the scale of individuals or even populations.  Results from these studies will be disseminated in peer reviewed journals and through presentations at scientific meetings."

Such learning is particularly consequential during adolescence, when increased exploration and autonomy confer many opportunities to make new choices. Poor decision-making represents one of the greatest perils of adolescence, with mortality rates doubling during this developmental stage, in large part due to risky or impulsive actions. However, the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning this developmental period of increased risky decision-making are not well understood. The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize how the dynamic developmental trajectory of brain circuitry involved in learning through positive and negative experience shapes real-world choices. Drawing upon behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging approaches, this work will examine how neurocognitive changes in value-based learning may give rise to a window of increased risky and impulsive decision-making during adolescence. A refined understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental changes in real-world decision-making has broad relevance across a number of societal domains including public policy, adolescent health, and juvenile justice.<br/><br/>This proposal will test whether risky and impulsive choice may stem in part from developmental changes in two specific aspects of how individuals learn from experience: (i) the relative weighting individuals place upon positive versus negative outcomes of past actions and (ii) the degree to which individuals form and recruit mental models of the potential future consequences of their actions. A developmental sample of participants, spanning late childhood to young adulthood, will complete sequential decision-making tasks in which they make a series of choices that can yield good or bad outcomes. By applying computational reinforcement-learning models to participants' choices in these tasks, we can precisely quantify developmental changes in these component processes of learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to characterize corresponding developmental changes in the brain circuitry engaged during learning. We will assess whether these neurocognitive changes in learning are predictive of participants' reports of their real-world risky and impulsive behavior, and whether they have distinct explanatory power from that of behavioral economic tasks that are commonly used to index risky and impulsive choice tendencies, but do not involve learning. A longitudinal follow-up session will enable assessment of the covariance between changes in learning and real-world risky and impulsive behavior as participants advance in their transition through adolescence. This work holds the potential to provide a more detailed mechanistic account of &#8232;how reinforcement learning mediates the dynamic relationship between brain and behavior over the course of development."

Typically, external companies called robotic integrators are employed for designing and implementing such systems. While the hardware used in this process is getting cheaper and cheaper, the physical labor of highly trained technical engineers needed to build and program these systems is not. This I-Corps team is developing easy-to-use software that will allow nontechnical users to design and implement their own automated systems that are customized to their own needs without having to hire costly robotic integrators. The new, proposed technology is lowering the barrier to entry for small business owners and home consumers through a web-based software platform where users can build their own programs for automation through a nontechnical, intuitive user interface. This initial prototype leverages a way of thinking about automation in terms of action and sensing primitives that derives from a university robotics research lab. The proposed technology has the potential to dramatically transform the population of people to whom automation, and its well-documented benefits, is available. The approach taken in this technology could bring simple, moving machines into many more environments.<br/><br/>Expanding the use cases of industrial automation to smaller batch sizes and narrower profit margins is a key challenge toward realizing the vision of the Internet of Things. This challenge is due in large part to the high cost of technical expertise required for the integration of available, cost-effective sensors, actuators, and algorithms. However, relatively inexpensive software can be developed to help users adapt existing technology to their environment. The proposed technology utilizes two key technical areas. One area is the computational architecture of the product and the development of a scalable code architecture and support for a larger number of so-called sensing and action primitives. Another area is in human factors where the ability of an untrained user to move from a contextualized use-case to specific logic design is key. Here, a relatively complex process must be distilled to essential steps that an untrained user can relate to a familiar process in a particular environment. Participation in the Innovation Corps will allow the team to identify and research the appropriate market in which to develop and launch a first product. In particular, the team will explore which customer base ? ranging from at-home hobbyists to small-to-medium sized industrial companies-is a good fit, in terms of feasible application of the technology as well as market demand and pricing, for the proposed technology. The team's participation will influence parallel development of technology and inform a business plan that will allow for commercialization of the technology."

This emerging area of research shows incredible promise for a variety of diseases, but current methods of stimulating individual nerves within a fiber are inaccurate and/or cause damage to the nerve. Optogenetics is a new technique has revolutionized interface with the nervous system by using light to stimulate nerves rather than more traditional electrodes. Light can stimulate a nerve without physically penetrating and damaging the nerve like many electrical stimulation techniques. However the optical stimulation has only been shown with low resolution in two dimensional patterns. This work exploit flexible display technology used in flat panel televisions; a small array will wrap around and stimulate the nerve in a three dimensional configuration.

Targeted stimulation of the nervous system can upregulate the body's response to immune deficiency and downregulate its response to autoimmune disease. Traditional nerve stimulation uses electrical stimulation outside of the nerve fiber to target individual axons or groups of axons, but the resolution of this technique is very poor. Squeezing the nerve can improve this resolution but only near the surface. More invasive techniques cut open the nerve and substructures to place extremely fine wires next to the nerves to improve resolution, but this is very invasive and can cause damage. This work leverages a new technique for neural stimulation, optogenetics. Optogenetics is the use of light to stimulate neurons that have been genetically sensitized to specific wavelengths. While this technique has revolutionized neural interface, the implementation has been fairly low resolution and two dimensional.<br/>This work uses ultra-thin flat panel display technology wrapped around the sciatic nerve to stimulate motor neurons. This enables a stimulation technique that is non-invasive to the nerve. In addition, it will increase the resolution of stimulation beyond other techniques external to the nerve. Multiple emitters can be used with optical power below the threshold for optogenetic stimulation simultaneously, so the intersection of the emitted light from each of the pixels will be sufficient to stimulate the axon. This should increase the resolution with which stimulation can be targeted within a nerve fiber. The efficacy of the system will be demonstrated using transgenic mice with motor neurons specifically transfected. An arrays of emitters will be wrapped around a mouse sciatic nerve with electromyography (EMG) used to confirm the stimulation.<br/>In addition, this grant will support the development of a bioelectronics workshop. The workshop will allow students, especially underrepresented minority students, to make their own neural and EMG recordings. The students will learn about how these bioelectronics interfaces can enable therapeutic and prosthetic technology."

Corals are animals that form the structural basis of these reefs, and contain microscopic algae inside their cells.  This mutualistic partnership or symbiosis provides the foundation of the entire diverse coral reef ecosystem.  While a great deal of attention has been focused on the environmental threats to corals and how and if corals will survive climate change, there remains only a partial understanding of the microscale cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin the coral-algal symbiosis. Insight into regulation of this symbiosis will provide a stronger foundation for studies of the impact of ocean warming, acidification and other anthropogenic stressors on coral health.  This project will bring together a coral biologist , a chemist, and a cancer cell biologist, to examine the intricate molecular and cellular conversations  that the partners of the symbiosis engage in to initiate and maintain the symbiosis.  The project will also examine how these conversations go awry and lead to symbiosis dysfunction and breakdown during the phenomenon of coral bleaching, a stress response to elevated temperature that results in coral death and reef degradation.  In addition to studying corals in the field, this project will also study sea anemones which are an excellent proxy for corals, many of which are endangered and are difficult to culture in a laboratory setting.  This project will contribute to the training of scientists and expose school-aged children to coral reef and symbiosis science.<br/><br/>Many cnidarians, including corals and anemones, engage in symbioses with photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.), and together they form the trophic and structural foundation of the coral reef ecosystem.

This project will examine inter-partner signaling and host cell immune response during onset and breakdown of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. Experiments will be conducted in two model systems, the anemone Aiptasia sp.-Symbiodinium B1 and larvae of the coral Fungia scutaria-Symbiodinium C1f. The team proposes the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize glycan recognition between host and invading Symbiodinium by glycan profiling and glycome manipulation of the algae, and host receptor pull-down approaches. Aim 2: Compare structural dynamics of phagocytosis and intracellular signaling when hosts are challenged with Symbiodinium by analyzing phagocytic profiles, phagosomal markers, NF-kB activation and the signaling sphingosine rheostat in hosts challenged with different symbiont types and other particles. Aim 3: Examine disruptions and changes in phagosomal dynamics and cell signaling in partnerships subjected to elevated temperature that leads to bleaching by measuring changes in phagosomal maturation, activation of NF-kB and sphingolipid signaling in host tissues after an elevated temperature stress."

As a result, many geophysical and geologic studies have measured and analyzed different sections of the very long rift system in detail, including studies using GPS geodesy to measure the speed, direction, and distribution in space of the ongoing separation of most of Africa (Nubia) from its eastern part (Somalia).  However, few, if any, of these previous studies took a comprehensive view over the whole rift and continent, in order to explore how different sections of the rift link together, interact with one another, or influence neighboring parts of the continent outside of the rift valleys.  Such a comprehensive view is necessary to better understand the whole continent and, indeed, how other continents split apart in the past or will in the future.  The broad process of rifting forms the basis of plate tectonic theory, and also influences the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes, geothermal resources, mineral resources, and topography in both time and space.<br/><br/>This experiment addresses two pieces of the task of building such a continent-scale view of rifting.  First, it includes compiling all known geodetic observations in Africa and surrounding regions from 22 different research groups representing 10 countries.  These data will then be combined into a single large-scale velocity field, thus minimizing any uncertainties in relative velocities (and strain rates) arising from variations in reference frame definitions, processing strategies, or network geometries.  Second, it includes re-measurements of high-value sites with limited or poor past measurement histories, including a campaign network spanning the Turkana Depression of the Kenya-Ethiopia borderlands, where two parallel active rift structures in Kenya relay to a single rift in Ethiopia.  Both of these efforts are directed at providing the highest possible quality present-day tectonic velocity field for the whole African Rift System at the continent scale, as a basic research product and as an open-access kinematic framework for many other diverse research efforts directed at the African system and rifting in general."

However, recent research results aimed at quantifying the effects of this dissipation shift on the LGM MOC came to conflicting conclusions, ranging from negligible effects to a large increase in the MOC. This project seeks to resolve these differences and test the aforementioned hypothesis. It will also provide the first quantification of the effects of realistic, data constrained, LGM stratification on turbulent diffusivities, mixing and the MOC. Other uncertainties will also be quantified thus leading to a comprehensive estimate of changes in tidal mixing and its impacts on the LGM MOC. Thus this project will lead to a better understanding of the processes that control planetary-scale ocean circulation changes and their associated biogeochemical cycles in fundamentally different climates.  A better understanding of the driving mechanisms for the MOC during the LGM has the potential to improve its quantification with important implications for efforts to quantify the glacial ocean?s carbon cycle and the resolution of the great puzzle of the glacial - interglacial variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide. A beneficial side effect of this project may also be that it improves the present day simulation of tidal mixing, diffusivities and circulation in two climate models that are widely used by the scientific community and influence the design of future Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Projects. A post-doctoral scientist will be supported and trained in running and analyzing a tide model. An undergraduate student will be exposed to research through a summer internship. A conference session will be organized with the goal to bring together modern physical oceanographers and paleoceanographers to foster interdisciplinary exchange of ideas.<br/><br/>A detailed modeling study to investigate effects of tidal mixing on the present day and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) will be conducted using a hierarchy of numerical models. Simulations with a global tide model will calculate distributions of tidal energy dissipation, which will be supplied to two global climate/ocean circulation models to quantify their effects on mixing and the MOC. Sensitivity experiments will explore uncertainties due to different proposed parameterizations of internal wave drag, tide model resolution, LGM stratification, floating ice, spatial variations in sea level, and the vertical decay of mixing above the sea floor on the results. Climate model simulations will be conducted with an intermediate complexity model and a state-of-the-science earth system model. Present day simulations will be evaluated by comparison to observational estimates of diapycnal diffusivities and tracer distributions. The effects of different circulations on biogeochemical cycles and isotopes of carbon and nitrogen will also be simulated. Finally, the LGM model results will be compared to paleo-reconstructions from available proxy records in order to evaluate the simulated circulations."

It responds to recent calls for action in the geoscience education research community, and builds on outcomes and needs identified in the 2012 National Research Council analysis of discipline-based education research, and on a recent NSF-funded project (#1513519 Shaping the Future of GER). The project will impact a wide cross section of the geoscience education community, including geoscience education scholars at 2-year and 4-year colleges and research universities, as well as cognitive scientists and geoscience education practitioners. Project activities will include digitization of past issues of the primary peer-reviewed GER journal, the Journal of Geoscience Education; this digitization will increase access to a valuable resource for current geoscience education researchers, as well as practitioners, education researchers in other STEM disciplines, and international scholars who are interested in geoscience education research and curriculum and instruction scholarship. In addition, the project will seek and compile input from the GER community via a broadly disseminated online survey and a summer workshop on what is most needed to support current and future geoscience education researchers. An online GER methods ""toolbox"" will also be developed to begin addressing needs of those new to GER. Collectively, these efforts will result in a synthesis of GER and a prioritization of the needs of the GER community, and will support current and future geoscience education researchers by offering forums for discussion and resources for their use. This synthesis can be used to help prioritize the next steps in GER, to improve research approaches and foster collaborations, and ultimately to improve teaching and learning in the geosciences.<br/><br/>Digitizing decades of past print-only articles in JGE will increase access to foundational GER studies, and expand the timeframe and number of studies for inclusion in GER literature reviews for a Journal of Geoscience Education theme issue on Synthesizing Results and Defining Future Directions of GER. The online survey is expected to reach most of GER researchers in the US, which will ensure broad community input in developing a prioritized list of needs to support current and future geoscience education researchers. The workshop at the 2016 Earth Educators' Rendezvous will bring 40 geoscience education researchers together to discuss survey results and GER findings, and share ideas for future research projects and collaborations. By designing an online GER toolbox, the project will develop a resource that will begin to address a GER community need. By drawing from findings in the collections of theme issue papers, from results of the broadly disseminated survey of geoscience education researchers and practitioners, and from the 2015 and 2016 EER GER workshops, the project will be able to identify important outcomes from GER, key research gaps, and critical needs of the GER community of practice."

The overall objectives of this study are to understand the dynamics governing the flux of momentum from shoaling nonlinear internal waves to mean currents; the scale and structure of mean flows driven by shoaling internal waves under idealized conditions; and the magnitude and spatial structure of the net mass transport associated with the shoaling internal waves. Despite the ubiquitous nature of nonlinear internal waves in the coastal ocean, very few three dimensional studies exist that include variability of the topography in the direction normal to propagation. This study represents the first attempt to quantify the transport pathways forced by internal waves and the mean flows generated by them and it is expected to produce results and methodologies with broad applicability in interdisciplinary oceanography and coastal management. The project will support the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. <br/><br/><br/>The approach is based on a state of the art, three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic numerical model with adaptive mesh capabilities. In addition, data previously collected in Massachusetts Bay during previous studies will be analyzed.  This is the first study to systematically address the mean flow and transport driven by nonlinear internal waves shoaling over bathymetry varying in two dimensions. The study comprises two components: a modeling component used to study the transfer of momentum and water mass transport in a variety of situations of increasing realism, and a data-analysis component which will consider the same problem using the extensive dataset available from a series of experiments conducted in Massachusetts Bay over the last 16 years. The modeling component will be used to aid in interpreting the data. The model (Stratified Ocean Model with Adaptive Refinement), developed in part with funding from previous National Science Foundation proposals, is a state-of-the-art three-dimensional non-hydrostatic stratified ocean model which employs adaptive mesh refinement to effectively use the computational resources, increasing resolution on demand where necessary."

This proposed research will address these science questions, which represent a significant need within the Aeronomy community. For this purpose the PI will utilize combined measurements from the Advanced Mesosphere Temperature Mappers (AMTMs), resonance lidars, and radars located at the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmospheric Research (ALOMAR), at Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) in Logan, UT, and these instruments deployed together during the recent DEEPWAVE airborne and ground-based field measurement program at New Zealand.

This research will foster beneficial collaborations between the MLT measurement and modeling communities, as well as provide an opportunity for collaboration on GW coupling between different areas of the atmosphere from the troposphere up through the MLT region. Since multi-scale dynamics also occur throughout the atmosphere and oceans, and likely in other planetary atmospheres, this research would benefit efforts to understand key GW roles in all of these fluid systems.

For infants and toddlers, these benefits are less evident. Toddlers do learn from interactive media such as mobile applications under some circumstances, but the specific conditions that result in learning from screen media remain unclear. The studies supported by this grant are designed to identify whether, how, and for whom screen media can be educationally valuable.<br/><br/>Two studies will explore: (1) the relation between children's gaze patterns and whether they learn while watching video and (2) the cognitive skills that predict toddlers' ability to learn from different media. The investigators will test how well toddlers (24-36 months) learn from different media, utilizing innovative approaches such as head-mounted eye tracking, which enables researchers to observe where children look while completing tasks. Of particular interest will be the extent to which individual differences in visual attention and cognitive skills predict toddlers' capacity to transfer from various screen media to real-life problems. It is expected that toddlers will learn more from video that is interactive, especially when interactive features help children focus attention on important information. It is further hypothesized that younger toddlers and those with poorly developed cognitive skills will benefit most from these applications. This work will inform the mechanisms by which screen-based learning occurs (or fails to occur) and address variability in toddlers' success in learning via electronic media.  By establishing how and for whom screen media support learning, results from these studies may also inform the development of scalable, cost-effective interventions that capitalize on mass media to reach millions of children, especially those at risk of school failure."

In the visual system such neuroplasticity occurs routinely, for example when we move from indoors to outside. Changing environments affects visual input dramatically, and cortical neurons alter how they respond in order to keep us seeing well. This type of neuroplasticity, called visual adaptation, occurs readily in the adult brain. Its effects tend to be short-lasting, however, limiting its potential applications in education, training, and health. To understand and overcome this roadblock, Dr. Stephen Engel and colleagues at The University of Minnesota will test the limits of adaptation, by extending laboratory studies an order of magnitude in duration. Participants will adapt for up to a week continuously, by viewing the world through virtual reality goggles that display modified output of a head-mounted camera. The experiments will measure how long-lasting the effects of adaptation can become, and test several factors that could be limiting the growth of this type of neuroplasticity. These include competition between the parts of the brain that benefit from neuroplasticity and the parts that could be hurt by it, since they depend upon stability of the brain regions that provide their input. Understanding adaptation should allow it to produce beneficial neuroplasticity, which has many applications. It could become part of training visual experts such as baggage scanner operators or imagery analysts. It could become part of efforts to rewire the brains of patients suffering from visual diseases, such as amblyopia (""lazy eye""). The work will also test theories of neuroplasticity that are applicable in many domains. It will produce educational materials for teaching of cognitive neuroscience, and will directly support the training of a diverse set of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge methods.<br/><br/><br/>Adult visual cortex can alter its function dramatically in response to changes in the environment, allowing it to function optimally, despite large changes in input. Critically, the longer vision experiences an environment, the stronger and longer lasting adaptation becomes. This suggests that long-term exposure to altered visual input may produce long-lasting changes in cortex. Technical issues have prevented the study of long adapting durations under controlled conditions, however leaving it unknown whether some factors 'put on the brakes', restricting its strength and durability. The PI developed methods to overcome this roadblock, and examined effects of a 4-days of continuous adaptation, revealing significant limits. The general goal of the grant is to understand the brakes producing those limits. For vision as a whole, adaptation can produce costs, as well as benefits, and this proposal will test whether observed limits are due to them. A first set of experiments will test whether costs limit adaptation in early visual areas, examining specific costs from the literature, removing them, and observing whether limits on adaptation remain present. A second set of experiments will examine longer-term adaptation. They will test the hypothesis that long-term adaptation can overcome limits, reducing costs by correcting for a ""coding catastrophe"" in later visual areas. The work will distinguish between major theories of adaptation, using quantitative analysis of behavioral and functional MRI (fMRI) data. It also represents a major empirical step forward; dozens of studies have examined adaptation in visual cortex, but no previous work has measured or tested adaptation's limits. Results of this research could influence work in a diverse array of fields where visual plasticity is important, from education to the military to public health. Results of the work will be incorporated into educational materials (an introductory fMRI course and text) that will be freely distributed. The grant will also provide training opportunities for a diverse group of students."

Studies of paleo-tides suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), due to the sea level drop of about 120 m, this situation was drastically different and dissipation was shifted from the shallow shelves into the deep ocean. This finding has prompted the hypothesis that the meridional overturning circulation during the Last Glacial Maximum must have been stronger. However, recent research results aimed at quantifying the effects of this dissipation shift on the LGM MOC came to conflicting conclusions, ranging from negligible effects to a large increase in the MOC. This project seeks to resolve these differences and test the aforementioned hypothesis. It will also provide the first quantification of the effects of realistic, data constrained, LGM stratification on turbulent diffusivities, mixing and the MOC. Other uncertainties will also be quantified thus leading to a comprehensive estimate of changes in tidal mixing and its impacts on the LGM MOC.

Despite decades of work, we have little ability to prevent, improve or treat such memory disorders. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ueli Rutishauser and colleagues are investigating how humans form, store, and retrieve memories. The research supported by this CAREER award is to observe the electrical activity of brain cells in the hippocampus, an area essential for the formation of new memories. This research is performed with human patients who are undergoing surgery to treat epilepsy. To localize seizures, these patients are implanted with small wires in different parts of their brain, which allows researchers to investigate the human nervous system at the cellular level. Using this technique, we will investigate how human brain cells change when new memories are formed. Specifically, we will test whether the formation of new memories is dependent on a brain rhythm called the ""theta oscillation"", and if disruptions of this rhythm lead to poor memory.  Critically, theta oscillations can be changed by electrical stimulation, which offers a potential technique to improve memory.  Through education, teaching, and mentoring, this CAREER award will enable new researchers and organizations to take advantage of the extremely valuable opportunities for basic research on the human nervous system presented by intracranial electrophysiology. <br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER award is to investigate the neural mechanisms of human declarative memory at the level of individual neurons and circuits. We work with patients implanted with micro-wire electrodes who volunteer to participate in this research. The objective is to understand how the activity of networks of neurons is coordinated such that their collective action results in plasticity and long-term memories. We test the hypothesis that hippocampal theta oscillations mediate this process by combining human single-neuron recordings, behavioral testing, electrical stimulation, and computational modelling. This approach will allow us to assess the role and necessity of oscillations for the formation of human memories and thereby demonstrate the role of a specific oscillation in human cognition. We study i) how the activity of two distinct functional types of hippocampal neurons that we identified (visual and memory selective) are modulated by the theta rhythm; ii) how modulation of theta oscillations by shifts in spatial attention impacts individual neurons; and iii) whether there is a causal link between theta oscillations and memory strength. This study could provide, for the first time, a link between the cellular mechanisms of plasticity, oscillations, and human memory. The educational objective is to closely involve students in all aspects of the research, and to incorporate research results into classes, workshops and a K-12 outreach program. The resulting methods, tools, and datasets will be publicly released."

Despite the importance of these associations, there is limited understanding of basic aspects about how stable interactions between host and algal partners is achieved. This inhibits our ability to make informed decisions about the management of vulnerable ecosystems. For example, coral reefs experience periodic bleaching events that involve the breakdown of the symbiosis and jeopardize reef health, but the process of bleaching and subsequent recovery of the host are poorly understood. To protect our valuable reef resources, greater understanding of the cellular and genetic cross-talk between symbiotic partners is required. This project will elucidate key components of the conserved genetic regulatory pathways important in host:symbiont exchanges. As changes to ocean environments occur (e.g., increasing average seawater temperatures), it is imperative that details about how hosts support symbiont populations at the cellular and genetic level are fully understood. The project has a diverse suite of planned broader impacts including training of STEM undergraduates, involvement in a pre-college summer bridge program to increase diversity in STEM, partnerships with national leaders in incorporating undergraduate research in community colleges, and high impact community based learning opportunities. <br/><br/>The research will refine understanding of host:symbiont interactions through identification of major-effect symbiosis genes and genetic pathways. The proposed work takes advantage of unique properties of marine and freshwater sponge hosts and their algal partners to identify the molecular, genetic, cellular, and physiological interactions that occur. These properties allow control over the timing of symbiont infection, so that gene expression profiles can be correlated with events involved with symbiont contact, engulfment, recognition, intracellular migration, and repopulation. In a methodologically novel way, the research will create different combinations of hosts and algal partners to explore reasons why particular hosts become suitable habitat for particular symbionts while other hosts cannot support those symbionts. The project will explore how down-regulating gene expression can change dynamics of host:symbiont interactions, and combining field-based experiments, RNAseq, and advanced physiological, microscopic, and molecular tools, the research will identify common regulatory features of those interactions. The results will increase understanding of the habitat requirements of the symbiont, and the ability of the hosts to interact with different partners. The results will also help define the scope of change in the identity of symbiotic partners. In addition to intellectual contributions in the form of publications and presentations, this project will expand educational and research opportunities for pre-college, community college, and undergraduate students, particularly those from underserved backgrounds. The proposal will support high impact practices like course-based research and community-based learning in the context of an undergraduate curriculum, as well as community outreach through a multi-disciplinary faculty learning community and civic-engaged talks."

Since its earliest days, flaming, trolling, harassment and abuse have plagued the Internet. This project will lay bare the structure of online abuse over many types of online conversations, a major step forward for the study of computer-mediated communication. This will result from modeling abuse with statistical machine learning algorithms as a function of theoretically inspired, sociolinguistic variables, and will entail new technical and methodological advances. This work will enable a transformative new class of automated and semi-automated applications that depend on computationally generated abuse predictions. The education and outreach plan is deeply tied to the research activities, and focuses on scaling-up the research's broader impacts.  A public application programming interface (API) will enable developers and online community managers around the world to integrate into their own sites the defenses against abuse developed by this research.<br/><br/>The work will consist of two major phases. In the first, the research will develop a deep understanding of abusive online behavior via statistical machine learning techniques. Specifically, the work will appropriate theories from social science and linguistics to inform the creation of features for robust statistical machine learning algorithms to predict abuse. These proposed abuse models will enable a brand new, transformative class of mixed-initiative artifacts capable of intervening in social media and online communities. In the second phase, this project will explore this newly enabled class of artifacts by building, deploying and evaluating sociotechnical tools for combatting abuse. Specifically, it will explore two classes of tools that use the abuse predictions: shields and moderator tools. The first, shields, will proactively block inbound abuse from reaching people. The second class of tools, moderator tools, will flag and triage abuse for community moderators."

Furthermore, the few apps that are based on educational research are resource-intensive to develop and therefore have limited opportunity to scale their success. This project is building an educational platform that addresses the problems of both quality and scale in this market. It is creating a content enhancement system designed specifically for creating research-based educational content that allows developers and content studios to build mobile and web apps at a fraction (10%-20%) of the cost of traditional app development. The content built using this system is automatically integrated with analytics and personalization technology that tailors the content to each child based on the child's responses. The personalization technology applies methods from psychometrics and cognitive development to ensure that the content adapts to the child and facilitates learning in an engaging way. The project will deliver a large library of context-based and personalized learning content for preK and primary grades that parents know is based on sound research, and ultimately helps increase school readiness and learning outcomes. Given the growing demand for age-appropriate mobile educational content for children, this project has the potential to generate significant returns as a commercial enterprise and, importantly, through the economic gains resulting from improvements in educational outcomes. It will also give content developers the opportunity to economically develop and deploy new content that uses personalization technology, without having to build this complex technology themselves, thereby applying this innovation at a large scale.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project is building a mobile game-based learning platform to onboard high quality third-party children's educational content and enhance their effectiveness through analytics and personalization. To achieve this, the project is developing two significant technical innovations: (1) a cloud-based personalization engine that powers adaptive learning in varied educational contexts and (2) a content enhancement system to efficiently and economically enrich third-party children's content (in the form of digital assets, books, or videos) with interactive learning games that are powered by the personalization logic. The personalization engine will use machine learning techniques combined with statistical methods of psychometric assessment and principles from cognitive development. It will inconspicuously measure children's interaction with the proposed platform's educational content and dynamically adjust game-play to suit each user's individual skills, interests and educational needs. The proposed model of leveraging and augmenting the efforts of many content developers is a dramatic departure from existing content development paradigms in this space. The goal of the project is to substantially increase the scale and reach of personalized, research-based learning experiences on mobile devices and ultimately maximize the potential of modern technology to deliver dynamic learning experiences."

The overall objectives of this study are to understand the dynamics governing the flux of momentum from shoaling nonlinear internal waves to mean currents; the scale and structure of mean flows driven by shoaling internal waves under idealized conditions; and the magnitude and spatial structure of the net mass transport associated with the shoaling internal waves. Despite the ubiquitous nature of nonlinear internal waves in the coastal ocean, very few three dimensional studies exist that include variability of the topography in the direction normal to propagation. This study represents the first attempt to quantify the transport pathways forced by internal waves and the mean flows generated by them and it is expected to produce results and methodologies with broad applicability in interdisciplinary oceanography and coastal management. The project will support the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. <br/><br/><br/>The approach is based on a state of the art, three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic numerical model with adaptive mesh capabilities. In addition, data previously collected in Massachusetts Bay during previous studies will be analyzed.  This is the first study to systematically address the mean flow and transport driven by nonlinear internal waves shoaling over bathymetry varying in two dimensions. The study comprises two components: a modeling component used to study the transfer of momentum and water mass transport in a variety of situations of increasing realism, and a data-analysis component which will consider the same problem using the extensive dataset available from a series of experiments conducted in Massachusetts Bay over the last 16 years. The modeling component will be used to aid in interpreting the data. The model (Stratified Ocean Model with Adaptive Refinement), developed in part with funding from previous National Science Foundation proposals, is a state-of-the-art three-dimensional non-hydrostatic stratified ocean model which employs adaptive mesh refinement to effectively use the computational resources, increasing resolution on demand where necessary."

The researcher will explore how ethnic minority women, who live in societies in which women's socioeconomic status significantly depends on their fertility, respond to and make use of government regulated IVF technology to achieve their own reproductive interests and validate their own gendered identities as women and mothers. The research will take place in Turkey, one of the world's fastest growing and tightly regulated IVF markets. The researcher will conduct twelve months of ethnographic research in the capital city (four months) and a southeastern city (eight months) dominated by a Kurdish minority population in Turkey. The methods include participant observation, interviews (with 108 individuals), and textual and statistical data analysis. Findings will be disseminated to guide policy makers, practitioners, and scholars developing education materials for, and/or making policies about reproduction and reproductive technologies."

(ii) Find efficient algorithms for producing the useful objects guaranteed to exist by (A), which currently require exponential time.  (iii) Explore the power of (B) as an algorithmic primitive in combinatorial optimization, in particular as an approach to graph partitioning problems, and understand whether it is actually more powerful than semidefinite programming.<br/><br/>The problems outlined in the proposal have the potential to impact various fields, such as signal processing, quantum computing, pseudorandomness, complexity theory, and operator theory.

Given points, how does one color them red and blue, so no circular region has too many of one color? The first question is open-ended until one defines evenly; the second is fully-specified, but hard -- there are many possible colorings and many regions to check. In these, and many similar problems, even when one is trying to be fair to a number of players, some will win a little and some will lose a little; the mathematical concept of ""discrepancy"" captures the amount of deviation from uniformity that must occur.  Through what sometimes seem abstract problems, such as coloring, this mathematics explores the limits of how well can a sample represent a whole -- an important question for computation, since algorithms are often made efficient by doing initial computation on a sample of the input data. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will explore questions of geometric discrepancy and their connections to algorithms for optimization and approximation. She has three foci: (1) Relative discrepancy, in which bounds depend on set size -- eg., the number of points in a circle. (In two and three dimensions, the PI has previously nearly optimal bounds in two- and three-dimensions.) Algorithms to find good colorings will also be sought, especially for geometric objects with characteristics (like ""fatness"") that apply to models for manufacturing or simulation.  (2) Extending epsilon-nets, which are samples that approximate a whole (e.g., a subset S from points P is an epsilon-net if any circle that contains an epsilon fraction of P must contain a point of S) so that you have some idea how many points from S lie in a circle that contains a larger fraction of P. Epsilon-nets not only help approximate a whole, but also indicate where more computation is needed in divide and conquer algorithms. (3) Leveraging improved epsilon nets for better approximation algorithms. It has been known for some time that improved bounds on epsilon nets in various geometric settings (e.g. axis aligned rectangles, etc) immediately give improved bounds for various NP-hard packing and covering problems in those same geometric settings. The PI has some of the strongest bounds (e.g. she proved optimal bounds in the case of axis-aligned rectangles, and has also found some practical applications of these to problems in networking), and aims to make progress on a number of still open questions in this domain, such as the size of weak epsilon-nets for axis aligned rectangles. <br/><br/>This work pulls together several themes in mathematics and computation, including when local solutions can be extended to global solutions.  Progress in understanding discrepancy can have broad and unexpected impact: fairness of resource allocation affects more than just science and engineering simulations."

As a result, many geophysical and geologic studies have measured and analyzed different sections of the very long rift system in detail, including studies using GPS geodesy to measure the speed, direction, and distribution in space of the ongoing separation of most of Africa (Nubia) from its eastern part (Somalia).  However, few, if any, of these previous studies took a comprehensive view over the whole rift and continent, in order to explore how different sections of the rift link together, interact with one another, or influence neighboring parts of the continent outside of the rift valleys.  Such a comprehensive view is necessary to better understand the whole continent and, indeed, how other continents split apart in the past or will in the future.  The broad process of rifting forms the basis of plate tectonic theory, and also influences the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes, geothermal resources, mineral resources, and topography in both time and space.<br/><br/>This experiment addresses two pieces of the task of building such a continent-scale view of rifting.  First, it includes compiling all known geodetic observations in Africa and surrounding regions from 22 different research groups representing 10 countries.  These data will then be combined into a single large-scale velocity field, thus minimizing any uncertainties in relative velocities (and strain rates) arising from variations in reference frame definitions, processing strategies, or network geometries.  Second, it includes re-measurements of high-value sites with limited or poor past measurement histories, including a campaign network spanning the Turkana Depression of the Kenya-Ethiopia borderlands, where two parallel active rift structures in Kenya relay to a single rift in Ethiopia.  Both of these efforts are directed at providing the highest possible quality present-day tectonic velocity field for the whole African Rift System at the continent scale, as a basic research product and as an open-access kinematic framework for many other diverse research efforts directed at the African system and rifting in general."

Computing machinery around the world consumes staggering amounts of energy. According to the NY Times in September 2012, digital warehouses like datacenters use thirty billion watts of electricity, which is equivalent to the output of thirty nuclear power plants. Networked computing elements are omnipresent in all computing machinery like datacenters, servers and High Performance Computing (HPC). Tens to thousands of multicore chips are interconnected to form an entire datacenter making the role of the network paramount in the performance and energy efficiency of the entire system.<br/> <br/>Data transfer between cores or memory components in different chips in large computing machinery need to traverse various interconnection technologies at the different levels of the network, often requiring change of switching protocols thus resulting in overheads. More importantly, according to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), the pitch of the interchip interconnects is not scaling as fast as the pitch of on-chip interconnects, resulting in a performance gap in the future. Additionally, the wiring complexity of both on-chip and off-chip interconnects exacerbates the problem by posing design challenges, crosstalk and signal integrity issues. Recent research envisions on-chip wireless interconnects using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technologies for designing Network-on-Chips, which are significantly more energy-efficient compared to traditional architectures. On the other hand in recent years considerable research has been done to develop wireless datacenters using the same 60GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. The integrated architecture proposed in this work will be capable of establishing wireless routes between communicating processing cores in a datacenter.<br/> <br/>This highly interdisciplinary project will engage experts from the disciplines of computer engineering, computer science and electrical engineering from both academia and industry. Using concepts and technologies from various domains like computer architecture, communication, integrated circuit packaging and datacenters, the project will establish methodologies for wireless interconnections in large-scale computing warehouses to decrease their energy consumption and carbon footprint, ultimately resulting in a green and sustainable computing paradigm."

While it is known that plants synthesize a novel chemical when exposed to conditions such as cold, drought and high salinity, what is not understood is how the plant ""cleans house"", that is, how the stress signal is removed so that the plant can begin normal growth once the stress is gone. Both genetic and biochemical approaches will be taken to determine exactly how these changes happen. This research will provide training of multiple UC-Davis undergraduates through research projects and support a graduate student and a post-doctoral scholar. These individuals will learn scientific methodology and how to present scientific data to colleagues and the greater community. They will learn analytical skills and improve their speaking and writing abilities. The graduate student will have the opportunity to interact with K-12 schools in neighboring communities with large Hispanic populations. The researcher will interact with representatives of the California seed/agricultural biotechnology industries through the Seed Institute at UC-Davis. The researcher has established a connection with a local Sacramento high school teacher and will continue this collaboration. The high school students will learn experimental design and data analysis, and participate in scientific discovery. <br/><br/><br/>Plants respond to environmentally stressful conditions by upregulating expression of genes that help them cope. One family of transcription factors required for stress responses are called ABRE BINDING PROTEINS (ABFs), and are regulated at the protein level. Under stress they are activated to promote transcription and at the same time their degradation is stopped and protein levels increase. How stress causes these two changes in ABFs and their relationship to biological function are not understood. ABF amino acids responsible for regulating constitutive ABF proteolysis under normal growth conditions and for stress-induced protein stabilization will be determined through in vitro and in vivo degradation assays. DNA sequences encoding ABF proteins will be changed so they translate ABF proteins with deletions and/or amino acid substitutions. ABF segments will also be fused with coding regions of marker enzymes and stability of the fusion determined in rapid and quantitative assays. Altered proteins will be expressed and purified from bacteria and stability measured in plant lysates. Sequences will be introduced into plants, multiple stable lines expressing these proteins produced and the in vivo protein stability measured. The role of phosphorylation status will be assessed by measuring the stability of proteins with substituted predicted or possible phosphorylation sites with either alanine, which cannot be modified, or with aspartate, which mimics modification. Transgenic plants expressing ABF proteins with differences in degradation rates will be assessed for their growth phenotypes under normal and stress conditions to determine if modulation of degradation provides greater stress resistance without compromising normal growth."

Current food safety tests require lengthy sample preparation (24-36h), and often products with short shelf life ?such as precut spinach and green leafs- are shipped before lab results. The goal of this project is to develop a technology for the separation of pathogens -such as Salmonella- from food, which will enable pathogen detection in less than 3 h. Shortening the time to detect pathogens in food from 24-36 h to less than 3 h will (i) allow producers of short-shelf-life produce to test before shipping, reduce Salmonella and E. coli outbreaks, and save in costs associated with recalls; (i) allow producers ground meat to save costs associated with refrigeration and storing during food safety tests;  (ii) allow FDA and CDC officials to test in the field, and respond and control outbreaks faster.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to find and validate a market fit, and to further develop a technology that will allow reducing the detection of pathogenic bacteria in food from 24-36h to under 3h. The proposed technology will replace bacterial enrichment, where the sample is incubated for 24 h to increase the bacterial number so that they can be separated from the food matrix and detected. The key innovation in this project is that by creating ""chemical traps"" this I-Corps team will leverage bacterial motility and specificity in chemotactic bacteria to have them ""self separate"" from the sample. This will constitute a paradigm shift on how separation of microbes has been attempted, where bacteria are treated as ""inert beads"" (e.g. dielectric and magnetic separations) instead of systems that can make decisions based on their microenvironment. The team's current prototypes, though appropriate for lab settings, do not meet the requirements to be a minimum viable product that can be presented to potential customers. By the end of the project this I-Corps team will develop a new prototype using 3D printing that will allow complete sealing of the samples and that the team will be able to use for demonstration in the customers' labs. Replacing enrichment in food safety tests will significantly shorten the time to results, and it may have a profound impact in ensuring the safety of the US food supply."

One family of models for surface uplift predicts uplift spatially and temporally associated with crustal thickening during mountain building processes.  In these models, surface uplift keeps pace with shortening of the crust.  Another family of models predicts that surface uplift is the result of removal of a dense subcrustal load accumulated during crustal shortening.  Uplift in these models significantly post-dates upper crustal shortening.  This project aims to test these end-member models in the best modern analog for an oceanic-continental subduction system: the Central Andean Plateau.  Successfully discriminating between these models has implications for the timing and pace of sedimentary basin formation in modern and ancient settings.  Because foreland basins host important hydrocarbon reserves, determining which model best describes their formation has potential implications for hydrocarbon exploration.  Surface elevation also impacts the global climate system and provides barriers to migration that promote the development of new biological species.  This project will promote full participation of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by supporting at least one female graduate student and at least one minority undergraduate student.  The principal investigator and his graduate students will contribute to STEM education by supporting geoscience outreach to local middle school and homeschool students and by supporting the TerraElm middleschool outreach program.  Funds from this project will support the education of the next generation in a globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate training.  Finally, it will support international collaborations between US and Peruvian scientists.     <br/><br/>This project will investigate the timing and mechanism of surface uplift of high elevation terranes in the archetypal ocean-continent subduction setting of the southern Peruvian Central Andean Plateau. Outstanding questions have prevented a systematic identification of the mechanism of basin formation and its relation to exhumation and surface uplift in the Peruvian Central Andean Plateau. Insufficient chronological data prevents a detailed reconstruction of the timing and tempo of sediment accumulation in the Peruvian Central Andean Plateau.  In this study, the principal investigator will develop a detailed chronology of deposition based on multiple intercalated volcanic strata in Neogene deposits and syndepositional volcanic zircons in Paleogene strata. A regional reconstruction of sediment provenance, dispersal systems, and basin geometry through time awaits application of multiple independent techniques will also be produced. The principal investigator will use detrital geochronology coupled with sandstone petrology, conglomerate clast composition, and paleocurrent data to track sediment sources through time. Detrital (Uranium-Thorium)/Helium thermochronology will be used in combination with detrital Uranium-Lead geochronology to track the locus of exhumation through time. Changes in depositional environments and climate are predicted to accompany surface uplift, and this will be demonstrated by documenting changes in depositional environment and climate using a combination of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions with paleotemperatures derived from carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry and by observations of changing sedimentary lithofacies associations. The project will also employ a novel paleoelevation proxy: delta-D values of the waters of hydration of volcanic glass to aid in reconstructing the paleoelevation of the Peruvian Central Andean Plateau."

For example, if the limb is amputated anywhere along its length a perfect replacement will regenerate in about 1-2 months and this regenerate will contain the bones, cartilage, joints, muscles, nerves, blood vessels and skin that were originally there and all in the exactly the same relationship to each other so that the limb will work again.  The goal of this project is to determine how growth factors and signaling molecules drive this process. It has long been known that the nerves supply a factor that stimulates the proliferation of the regenerating cells in the limb, and several candidates have been identified recently.  This project functionally tests each of these candidates in a novel assay based on gene expression in the wound epidermis.  The identification of a factor that stimulates proliferation would have a huge impact on mammalian systems where the lack of proliferation is the major impediment to tissue regeneration. In addition to the nerve factor, two additional signaling pathways are utilized to guide the regenerative process.  These will also be examined using the latest gene knockout techniques to determine how these pathways interact with other known signals. This project will impact several scientific communities, and the public at large because regeneration has huge public appeal.  Examples of this interest include that fact that these recent axolotl regeneration studies were highlighted in TV programs and other public media, and received public acclaim. Additionally, this project includes specifically-designed mini-research projects that involve 4-6 undergraduates per year, and promotes active involvement of under-represented minorities and women.<br/><br/><br/>The first part of this project concentrates on the function of the apical epidermis that forms after limb amputation as a crucial regulator of regeneration. Transcriptomic analysis has identified the limb-specific genes expressed in this apical epidermis, including Wnt, BMP and FGF -  as well as two novel pathways: IGF and RA. These new pathways will be examined by inhibition using antisense morpholinos, pharmacological inhibition and Crispr/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis to identify interactions with other pathways by qPCR and in situ hybridization. The transcriptional network downstream of RA signaling will also be examined by RNA-Seq to identify targets of this signaling molecule. The second objective is to discover the molecular basis of the neurotrophic control of limb regeneration.  A novel approach will be used to screen 12 potential neurotrophic factors for their effect on gene expression in the apical epidermis in vitro since the apical epidermis is the primary target of the nerve. Included in this screen are 7 novel neurotrophic factors that were identified in a microarray for secreted factors from sensory nerves.  Successful candidates will be taken further using in vivo analyses including expression patterns during limb regeneration and over-expression in transgenic animals."

These earthquakes may be triggered by pressure changes in subsurface rock layers resulting from injection or withdrawal of fluids, and are referred to as induced seismicity. These earthquakes pose a hazard to local residents and create challenges for energy production. However, despite recent research, we remain unable to determine, prior to injection, whether wells in a given area are likely to induce earthquakes, and if so, of what number and magnitude. This research seeks to determine the primary factor(s) controlling the triggering of induced seismicity, to test seismic methods of detection of increased fluid pressure along subsurface fault zones that may potentially increase seismic risk, and to investigate whether faults produce detectable seismic signals during the initiation of fault slip during moderate earthquakes. Results from this research will be combined with related studies to provide current and unbiased scientific information regarding induced seismicity to stakeholders, such as local residents, oil and gas regulators, oil and gas corporations, or scientists advising these groups. The results will have broad global significance for energy resource development since induced seismicity has occurred in association with wastewater disposal wells, hydraulic fracturing operations, geothermal stimulation, gas production, and gas storage. Induced seismicity is a potential challenge for long-term carbon storage in the subsurface, one of the primary solutions proposed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus mitigating the impacts of climate change. Results from this research may also provide insight into the processes by which fault slip initiates during earthquakes.<br/><br/>This research will acquire seismic data using long-term and dense passive seismic networks, encompassing regions of high-volume wastewater disposal near known large faults. Data will be used to monitor the seismic or aseismic nature of pressure propagation away from active wells, and to probe the seismic responsiveness of the local faults. Forty-five broadband seismometers will be deployed at  about 5 km spacing in two 18-month deployments, first in Oklahoma and subsequently in a complementary region of active fluid injection. Within the spatial footprint of the first deployment, a high-density array will be deployed over actively evolving seismicity. Specifically, the research will address 1) whether dense arrays are capable of continuously mapping pressure migration fronts away from wastewater disposal wells by detecting signals from fluid pressure migration; 2) the degree to which this migration is focused along a narrow pathway of faults/fractures, or dispersed over multiple pathways; 3) whether large fault zones are seismically reactive to the larger nearby earthquakes; and 4) whether seismic source characteristics change temporally as fluid pressure increases. The region within north-central Oklahoma includes active seismicity, large disposal wells, and a major fault system. In the second region, with a contrasting geological environment, this research will test and refine methods to detect signals of high fluid pressure approaching faults. Results from both deployments will be synthesized in the global context of induced seismicity. This research seeks to engage local residents and to help them become more confident in finding the information necessary to make informed decisions important in their lives. The scientific results will be communicated to stakeholders, within the context of a frequently updated synthesis of research completed by other groups. This work will engage next-generation leaders in the fields of hazards and resources across geoscience and engineering."

The need arises from the filter's location (between amplifier and antenna) and performance (half the power is lost due to inefficiencies). As a result, components must be over-designed to accommodate for the filter loss. The excessive losses degrade battery life and drive higher thermal management costs in the system.

The PI, Dr. Marvin Chun, has a strong record of dedication to mentoring, teaching, and public outreach.<br/><br/>The new attention profile investigated here predicts a performance ranking for novel individuals based on models of whole brain functional connectivity, which can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the resting state, collected while participants lie passively in the scanner without performing an explicit cognitive task.  Models of intrinsic connectivity in a whole brain attention network during the resting state are created to significantly predict sustained attention task performance.  This project will develop further models to test other attention components such as alerting, orienting, and executive function.  Collectively, these whole brain functional connectivity models will provide a quantitative attention profile for individual participants.  Because we can apply our models to novel subjects or independent data sets from different sites, these new methods have broad applicability, and they are predictive rather than just descriptive."

However, training of such deep neural networks requires huge amount of computational resources that are not affordable for mobile applications. Hardware acceleration of deep learning, with orders of magnitude improvement in speed and energy efficiency, remains a grand challenge for the conventional hardware based on silicon CMOS technology and von-Neumann architecture. As the learning algorithms extensively involve matrix operations, neuro-inspired architectures that leverage the distributed computing in the neuron nodes and localized storage in the synaptic networks are very attractive. The ultimate goal of this project is to advance the neuro-inspired computing with emerging nano-device technologies towards a self-learning chip. A chip that learns in real-time and consumes low-power can be placed at frontend sensors, bringing broad benefits for a number of current applications. The PI will establish close collaboration with industry through student internships and technology transfer. The plan for integration of research and education will train students with interdisciplinary skills. The cross-layer nature of this project ranging from semiconductor device, circuit design, electronic design automation, and machine learning is expected to provide an ideal platform for this educational goal.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to overcome the challenges that prevent scaling up of the crossbar array size for neuro-inspired architecture. Resistive devices with continuous multilevel states have been proposed to function as synaptic weights in the crossbar architecture. However, with the increase of the array size, issues associated with device yield, device variability, and array parasitics will arise and may degrade the system performance. The PI plans to tackle these challenges by exploiting hierarchical research efforts from devices, circuits and architectures. The outcome of the research includes device compact model, circuit-level benchmark simulator for estimating the area/latency/power of the crossbar array macro, and architectural tool for efficiently mapping the learning algorithms into the crossbar architecture.  The PI has established a custom fabrication channel for tape-out of resistive devices on top of CMOS peripheral circuits via his collaboration with academic partners. The prototype chip with measured data is expected to make a strong impact on this field, which previously relied on the simulations for predicting large-scale array performance."

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.<br/><br/>This Site at M S&T integrates education and research with cutting-edge applications to create and convey knowledge that serves the State of Missouri and the nation, and helps solve societal challenges at global scale. The Site enhances the university strategic plan which requires experiential learning as an integral component of undergraduate curricula to foster innovation and creativity. In addition, the I-Corps Site encourages a large number of untapped STEM talents and provides institutional support for commercialization. The complementary, on-campus Student Design and Experiential Leaning Center is also leveraged to develop student entrepreneurs and accelerate their business ideas to the market place. <br/><br/>By providing targeted seed funds for commercialization efforts, the I-Corps Site enhances existing programs at S&T, improves visibility of entrepreneurship, and expands participation in existing technology transfer programs. Thirty teams per year receive I-Corps Site funding to translate ideas and research to the marketplace. The Site entrepreneurial education program is based on the I-Corps curriculum with experiential, collaborative learning and uses the Lean LaunchPad methodology. The Site objectives are to: <br/>(1) Enhance entrepreneurial activities and training experiences for undergraduate and graduate students at S&T; <br/>(2) Expand training opportunities available to post docs, faculty, underrepresented groups using LLP model; <br/>(3) Increase the number of teams entering the I-Corps program, entrepreneur fellows at the University of Missouri System and S&T, and VentureWell E-Teams; and <br/>(4) Transition more activities to commercialization. <br/>Teams are recruited from existing and new entrepreneurial student activities, course projects, research, and participants in local and regional venture competitions and entrepreneurship events.<br/><br/>The I-Corps Site impacts the Midwest region and Central Missouri where S&T is located. Rolla and its surrounding rural areas are remote and in need of economic resurgence. The I-Corps Site catalyzes activities to create a critical mass of innovators and entrepreneurs to establish a local technology hub and economic base and engage civic leaders and other stakeholders. The Site also serves as a bridge for collaboration with more mature startup communities and developed economic bases in St Louis and Kansas City. The Site provides fertile ground for experiential training of students from nearby community colleges, middle schools, and high schools through entrepreneurship courses, seminars, workshops, innovation camps and competitions, and other outreach activities. Special attention is being paid to recruit and involve female and underrepresented minority students in this program; the activities of which will be widely disseminated through various mechanisms including a dedicated website, newsletters and other social media."

For older children, educational media can foster school readiness through increased cognitive, language, and social skills, making it a valuable intervention tool for promoting successful school entry. For infants and toddlers, these benefits are less evident. Toddlers do learn from interactive media such as mobile applications under some circumstances, but the specific conditions that result in learning from screen media remain unclear. The studies supported by this grant are designed to identify whether, how, and for whom screen media can be educationally valuable.<br/><br/>Two studies will explore: (1) the relation between children's gaze patterns and whether they learn while watching video and (2) the cognitive skills that predict toddlers' ability to learn from different media. The investigators will test how well toddlers (24-36 months) learn from different media, utilizing innovative approaches such as head-mounted eye tracking, which enables researchers to observe where children look while completing tasks. Of particular interest will be the extent to which individual differences in visual attention and cognitive skills predict toddlers' capacity to transfer from various screen media to real-life problems. It is expected that toddlers will learn more from video that is interactive, especially when interactive features help children focus attention on important information. It is further hypothesized that younger toddlers and those with poorly developed cognitive skills will benefit most from these applications. This work will inform the mechanisms by which screen-based learning occurs (or fails to occur) and address variability in toddlers' success in learning via electronic media.  By establishing how and for whom screen media support learning, results from these studies may also inform the development of scalable, cost-effective interventions that capitalize on mass media to reach millions of children, especially those at risk of school failure."

But the proofs only establish correctness with respect to a model of the underlying processor on which the code executes.  Unfortunately, the community lacks high-fidelity, carefully tested specifications of widely-used processors, such as Intel's x86 family of processors. This severely limits efforts in making software reliable and secure, from software assurance to malware analysis to sandboxing technologies. The goal of this project is to provide tools for building, reasoning about, and validating models of widely-used processors.  The proposed research will result in public specifications of common processors, which will benefit a wide range of software applications. It will help improve the dependability and security of critical software applications.<br/> <br/>The investigators' approach to building processor models is carefully designed to support reuse of components across different architectures and different applications.  In particular, they propose to formalize two domain-specific languages that will make it easy to specify decoders and instruction semantics.  The tools for these languages will include support for efficient execution so that the models can be tested against implementations.  To demonstrate the efficacy of these tools, the investigators will build and validate models of both the x86 and ARM families of processors.  They will also investigate applications of these models by building correctness proofs of verifiers for inlined reference monitors and by integrating them as the target languages of a verified compiler. The investigators plan to expend efforts on building a community of researchers for formal processor models and to involve this community to give feedback, improve, and use the models. The project will also provide excellent opportunities for training undergraduate students and for developing new curriculum materials on formal methods."

Outdoor air pollution is among the top 10 causes of mortality in the U.S. (and is the largest environmental cause), annually responsible for ~1% of total deaths. Those health risks are not evenly distributed among the population. An important aspect of sustainable development is to understand how urban design and urban environments can help meet social and ?fairness? goals, including avoiding large imbalances in environmental risks among subpopulations?especially along lines of race or income. This project will uncover new relationships among air pollution, demographic attributes relevant to environmental justice, and the spatial layout of urban areas; and will develop an education and outreach program to engage disadvantaged youths. Objectives are to (1) characterize spatial patterns in air pollution concentrations throughout the U.S., and over time, (2) characterize spatial relationships between air pollution and demographic attributes relevant to environmental justice (EJ), covering multiple spatial scales (national, state, county, and urban); (3) identify how shifts in the spatial layout of cities relate to air pollution metrics relevant for EJ; and (4) integrate research findings into education and outreach. The research approach uses an air pollution model that incorporates available demographic data (US Census) and pollution measurements by the U.S. EPA, satellite-based measures of air pollution, and information about land uses (e.g., roads, built-up areas, parks). The model offers spatial precision and therefore provides a good basis for predicting how concentrations vary among communities. New knowledge generated will be integrated into education and outreach activities, including a program to engage high school students in disadvantaged communities and challenge them to investigate and address EJ conditions locally. Targeted results will generate new knowledge relevant to EJ conditions, how they are changing, and how they relate to urban form. Research and outreach activities will identify and test potential solutions.  The project will provide observational evidence relating air pollution and demographic attributes such as race and income; and, will explore how those relationships (i) vary with spatial scale of analysis (from within-urban to national-scale) and over time, and (ii) correlate with the spatial layout of urban areas. The combination of available data, including new satellite measurements, with cutting-edge, high-resolution pollution models will provide a novel approach for understanding these issues. It is anticipated that findings will advance theory and practice in environmental sustainability by exploring a long-term factor influencing air pollution (urban form) and by uncovering equity aspects of environmental impacts. The high-precision air pollution models to be developed have the potential to be useful to researchers in outside fields such as environmental epidemiology and environmental economics. Findings will be integrated into existing curricula and programs aimed at increasing science and engineering enrollment of underrepresented students. A new program will challenge students to explore community-scale solutions. Research findings, quantifying conditions relevant to EJ for cities and regions throughout U.S., will be shared directly with local, state, and national environmental policy makers. An interactive website will allow the public to explore spatially precise estimates of long-term air pollution in their neighborhood."

This enzyme performs oxidative ring-cleavage at the meta position of six-membered aromatic rings in a reaction known as extradiol dioxygenation. HAO is a prototypic member of extradiol dioxygenases built upon a cupin structural fold (known as type III extradiol dioxygenases). The goal of this project is to study the substrate recognition, oxygen binding, activation, selective targeting, and to identify the intermediates of the reactions catalyzed by HAO. Furthermore, the Liu lab seeks to identify the role of an additional rubredoxin-like Fe(Cys)4 center of the enzyme, which is not required for catalysis but is conserved in bacterial enzymes. The research aims to build a framework for understanding the mechanism of these enzymes and common steps shared by extradiol dioxygenases. The chemical, structural, and spectroscopic properties of iron-bound oxygenated intermediates will help illuminate iron-dependent oxygen activation and oxidation mechanisms.<br/> <br/>The incorporation of molecular oxygen into organic molecules is one of the most important metabolic processes in nature and its ultimate purpose is energy extraction. The Liu laboratory studies the mechanism by which a particular enzyme accomplishes this task.  Knowledge created by the lab advances the understanding of oxygen activation and its specific incorporation into metabolites. The scientific questions are answered by using biochemical methods, spectroscopic tools, X-ray crystallography, and computational modeling. This multidisciplinary pursuit creates substantial opportunities to engage science students, including members of groups underrepresented in science, in research at the frontier of chemistry and biology. The knowledge gleaned from the research are incorporated in the biochemistry and bioinorganic chemistry curriculum."

This research will focus on the development and maintenance of social inequality.  Inequality is a defining characteristic of all prehistoric complex societies and and is of contemporary relevance because it characterizes all societies which exist in the world today.  Archaeologists speculate that it first became formalized within and between households, although little is currently known about how households contributed to emergent ideologies and were innovators and creators of that ideology.<br/><br/> The objective of this research is to determine how households contributed to social inequality at the Preclassic-period (900 BCE-150 CE) site of Holtun, Guatemala. The investigators central hypothesis is that social inequality developed at Holtun circa 300 BCE, and social complexity circa CE 25, with the support of both emergent elite and commoner households at the site through the medium of communal ritual and the economy associated with it. The central hypothesis will be tested by, 1) identifying and studying the development of social inequality through variation in Middle Preclassic-period (600-300 BCE) household inventories, 2) identifying and studying the differential contribution of households to communal ritual and economic activity through time, and 3) identifying the source and changes in ritual practice and symbols within and between households through time. Principal methods include excavation into domestic and monumental architecture, and analysis of artifacts using both traditional and contemporary approaches including: ceramic and lithic typological classification, petrography, lithic microwear analysis and replication studies, faunal analysis, X-ray Fluorescence, stable-isotope analysis of human bone, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, and soil geo-chemistry studies. <br/><br/>This project will promote teaching, training, and learning by employing graduate, undergraduate, and Dallas-area high school students to engage in archaeological research, training, and experimental studies.

While the number of women attaining doctoral degrees in the social sciences has risen, women in archaeology still have not achieved equal employment and representation in the field. The research also incorporates Latino high school students from one of Dallas Counties poorest cities and provides training for an international team including Guatemalan undergraduates. The results of this research will be broadly disseminated to the international community at conferences and meetings. Results will be published in annual archaeological site reports and available online at a project website through SMU's server with data available to the public on tDAR and/or the Open Science Framework."

One promising approach involves synthesis of the computer implementation codes from formal specifications, by software tools. This project contributes to this ""correct-by-construction"" approach, by developing scalable, automated methods for the synthesis of control protocols with provable correctness guarantees, based on insights from models of human behavior. It targets: (i) the gap between the capabilities of today's hardly autonomous, unmanned systems and the levels of capability at which they can make an impact on our use of monetary, labor, and time resources; and (ii) the lack of computational, automated, scalable tools suitable for the specification, synthesis and verification of such autonomous systems.<br/><br/>The research is based on study of modular reinforcement learning-based models of human behavior derived through experiments designed to elicit information on how humans control complex interactive systems in dynamic environments, including automobile driving. Architectural insights and stochastic models from this study are incorporated with a specification language based on linear temporal logic, to guide the synthesis of adaptive autonomous controllers. Motion planning and other dynamic decision-making are by algorithms based on computational engines that represent the underlying physics, with provision for run-time adaptation to account for changing operational and environmental conditions. Tools implementing this methodology are validated through experimentation in a virtual testing facility in the context of autonomous driving in urban environments and multi-vehicle autonomous navigation of micro-air vehicles in dynamic environments. Education and outreach activities include involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the research, integration of the research into courses, demonstrations for K-12 students, and recruitment of research participants from under-represented demographic groups.

These attacks can cause damages ranging from application malfunction, loss of private data, to a complete takeover of users' computers.  One effective strategy for limiting the damage is to adopt the principle of least privilege in application design: the application is split into several protection domains and each domain is given only the necessary privileges to perform its task. In this design, the compromise of one domain does not directly lead to the compromise of other security-sensitive domains.  The PI proposes to design and implement a framework that makes it easy for software developers to apply the principle of least privilege to their applications. The proposed framework will significantly improve the security of critical software applications. It will benefit the software industry by designing new technologies for building secure software systems.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines several novel ideas: (1) user-space protection domains through binary-level enforcement of isolation and information-flow security; (2) a declarative language that allows for flexible configuration of an application's security architecture; (3) a binary-level partitioning tool that automatically splits an application into components of least privilege; (4) a compositional reasoning mechanism that allows developers to perform formal reasoning about an application's end-to-end information security.  By staying in the user space, the proposed framework is OS independent, and by working on binary code, it is source-language agnostic, making it more broadly applicable.  Developers can use it to partition an application, flexibly configure its security architecture, and reason about its information security.  On the education side, the PI will organize a series of activities to increase high school students' awareness of security, privacy, and secure programming.  The central activity is a summer workshop that gathers local high-school technology teachers and helps them design lesson plans that can be integrated into their schools' technology curriculum."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

With this explosion of video data comes a pressing need to develop automatic video summarization algorithms.  Video summarization takes a long video as input and produces a short video as output, while preserving its information content as much as possible.   As such, summarization techniques have great potential to make large video collections substantially more efficient to browse, search, disseminate, and facilitate communication.  Such increased efficiency will play a vital role in many important application areas.  For example, with reliable summarization systems, a primatologist gathering long videos of her animal subjects could quickly browse a week's worth of their activity before deciding where to inspect the data most closely.  A young student searching YouTube to learn about Yellowstone National Park could see at a glance what content exists, much better than today's simple thumbnail images can depict.  An intelligence agent could rapidly sift through reams of aerial video, reducing the resources required to analyze surveillance data to identify suspicious activities.<br/><br/>This project develops new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for video summarization.  Unsupervised methods, which are the cornerstone of nearly all existing approaches, have become increasingly limiting due to their reliance on hand-crafted heuristics.  By instead posing video summarization as a supervised learning problem, this project investigates a markedly different formulation of the task.  The research team is investigating four key new ideas: powerful probabilistic models for learning to select the optimal subset of video frames for summarization, semi-supervised learning models and co-summarization algorithms for leveraging the abundance of multiple related videos, algorithms for exploiting photos on the Web to improve summarization, and evaluation protocols that assess summaries in a way that aligns well with human comprehension.  The broader impact of the proposed research includes practical tools for video summarization, scientific advances that appeal broadly to several communities, publicly disseminated research results, inter-disciplinarily trained graduate students, and outreach activities to engage young students in STEM education and career paths."

The main research thrust is to develop new ancestral genome reconstruction algorithms that handle rearrangements, duplications, and large insertions and deletions at different resolutions in a single unified framework. These methods will be applied to the large number of whole-genome sequence data that have become available to elucidate detailed history of large-scale genomic operations in mammalian genomes. With the reconstructed history, scientists will be able to explain the large-scale genomic changes and assess their phenotypic impact on any lineage, including the human lineage. <br/><br/>The PI considers the problem of ancestral genomes using a parsimony principle based on breakpoint graphs that are consistent with current genomes.

Before the origins of that mix can be understood, the nature of the exoplanets and their host stars must be understood. The current observational goal is to classify exoplanets as gas-dominated (like Neptune), ice-dominated, or rock-dominated (like Earth) and then compare those classifications to measured stellar properties. Surely, they must be tightly connected since the stellar and exoplanet systems formed from the same cloud of atomic and molecular gas.

These impacts are projected to become more significant in the future due to ongoing urbanization, population densification, and global climate change. The aim of this research is to answer the question, what are the most effective urban heat mitigation strategies for the populations that are most vulnerable to extreme heat? The analysis will focus on neighborhoods in Los Angeles, CA that contain populations that are especially physically and financially vulnerable to increasing extreme heat: (1) the elderly, (2) those without air conditioning, and (3) those of low socioeconomic status that cannot afford increased energy costs. <br/><br/>The research will develop a multi-scale coupled modeling framework that resolves regional-scale meteorology, micro-scale meteorology, and building energy flows. Neighborhoods in Los Angeles with vulnerable populations will be identified using parcel-level GIS datasets of population age, income, and access to air-conditioning. The heat mitigation strategies that will be assessed include solar reflective rooftops and pavements, and increased use of street-level and rooftop urban vegetation. These mitigation strategies will be assessed for impacts on (a) outdoor and indoor air temperatures, (b) human thermal comfort, heat stress, and heat-related mortality, (c) indoor thermal conditions for representative buildings without air conditioning, and (d) air-conditioning energy use for representative buildings with air conditioning. Model performance for each element of the model will be thoroughly evaluated by comparing to observations. The multi-scale model and methods for targeting vulnerable populations will be applicable to other cities worldwide in future work. Results from the project will provide targeted solutions to help vulnerable populations deal with extreme heat. Solutions will be communicated to local policy makers, utilities, and other stakeholders, all of whom the PIs have already-established relationships, to provide pathways for implementation. Discoveries will also be communicated to middle and high school students in areas with vulnerable populations through outreach programs at University of Southern California (USC). The PI will work with teachers through USC's Research Experience for Teachers program, with the goal of designing curriculum and research focused lessons that teach students about the fundamental physics describing extreme heat mitigation. Additionally, the PI will teach a demonstration focused lesson in participating teacher's classrooms to excite future young scientists and engineers to follow careers in STEM. A simple website will be created summarizing research outcomes and providing practical solutions for mitigating extreme heat."

Prior research determined that high elevation tree species in Guatemala and Honduras do form annual growth rings that can be dated to their exact year of formation; this is unusual for tropical tree species.  It is understood that variations in ring width in these trees reflect the amount of winter and spring rainfall.  With this knowledge, the investigators will develop estimates of past precipitation along Guatemala's 'Dry Corridor,' a region that currently suffers from severe water and food security challenges. Tree-ring data will be collected from mountain sites across this region, and these will be used to develop estimates of past rainfall over the last five centuries or more.  The benefit of these precipitation reconstructions using tree rings is that they can be used to understand whether current climate variability is exceptional compared to the last several centuries and the extent to which natural variability is entwined with a human-influenced changes.  Specifically this research will evaluate the hypothesis that there are important modes of natural variability in Central American rainfall at time scales of decades and longer. This knowledge will help test and improve models that predict future rainfall trends both regionally and globally and can be applied to understanding their cause and consequences.<br/><br/>This research expands the geographic extent of annual, climate-sensitive tree-ring data further into the American tropics.  Knowledge gained from this project will be relevant in a region with populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as it is likely that increases in drought and flooding will be the most direct and immediate consequences of global warming for human society.  Changes in rainfall exacerbate existing and emerging threats to sustainable water supplies from growing populations, pollution, declining infrastructure, and boundary conflicts.  A long-term perspective on the potential range of variability in precipitation, and in particularly decadal-scale fluctuations, is critical for predicting and planning for the consequences of changes in water availability.  This research project provides a hands-on and international research experience for both graduate and undergraduate students from the United States and also facilitates the involvement of Central American students and scientists in geographic research with US collaborators. Coordination between US and Central American scientists will facilitate skills training and knowledge development so that local resources and information are available to address sustainability and vulnerability reduction efforts.  <br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities."

The investigators will develop computationally efficient algorithms for identifying genetic information from family data using a technique known as a Hidden Markov model. This model has demonstrated considerable success in a broad range of scientific disciplines, including areas such as speech recognition in telephone conversations and face identification from sequences of images. When the complexity of the problem increases, computational algorithms confront challenges with finding the solution of the model in realistic and practical time frames. The investigators' research on novel computational and statistical approaches will provide efficient algorithms, and software tools, of broad scientific relevance. In their work the tools developed will yield a more powerful approach for finding genes underlying complex diseases. The collaborative team will also directly apply their techniques to forestry genetic data describing a multi-year plant-breeding program.  Educationally, the trainees involved will be integrated into a vibrant interdisciplinary research team, gaining exposure to techniques for the solution of real world problems. <br/><br/>Multi-dimensional Markov processes are ubiquitous in the real world. Dependencies in interacting particle systems, images, videos, digitized documents, and gene transmission are all examples of multi-dimensional Markov processes. A Markov process is a random process (i.e., a statistical phenomenon in which the possible outcomes of a sequence of events or variables vary) in which the prediction of the future state is made just using the information of the current state, independent of both past history and unknown future states. This idea generalizes for higher dimensions.  For example, gene transmission from parent to child is a two-dimensional Markov process, the determination of the future state, the child, depends on the neighbors in two dimensions, the parents.  Most cases of interest, however, are hidden Markov processes, in which the current state of a variable cannot be observed, but must be inferred by consideration of all possible future states given all possible current states.  As the number of quantities to be determined increases, the computational demand in both computer memory and computing time increases dramatically. To apply the concept, therefore, to many important real applications requires the development of novel and powerful computational algorithms.  This project is focused on the design of a novel software package, specifically designed for the solution of hidden Markov models. The techniques developed will be relevant for the solution of problems from a broad array of disciplines, not only for wider family based genetic studies but also areas such as text analysis from images. Thus, this project will increase the computational ability to solve real-world problems across many engineering, geosciences and biological disciplines, with commensurate potential positive societal impact. In this case an interesting application arises in plant breeding through the collaboration with experts in forestry science."

Analysis of water concentrations in peridotite pyroxenes will be used to constrain the outcrop-scale variation in water in relation to shear deformation. The education component of this CAREER project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with experience in advanced field methods through the use of terrestrial laser scanning. Experience with cutting-edge analytical techniques and field campaign planning will prepare students for future careers in the geosciences.

This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award supports fundamental research to engineer strength and toughness into metals, by establishing a framework of strengthening and toughening mechanisms in metals.  The research program will investigate fundamental mechanisms of deformation in structural metals at the microscopic scale, and relate these to the performance of these materials.  This research involves collaborations between the University of California at Davis, Georgia Institute of Technology and Los Alamos National Laboratories, with a synergistic approach encompassing experimentation, modeling and simulation, and diagnostics.   This research will accelerate materials discovery by building a knowledge base to design materials that have specific combinations of strength and toughness.<br/><br/>The goal of this DMREF research is to engineer twin-twin meshes.   The hypothesis is that these meshes can simultaneously impart strength by introducing a high density of barriers to slip, toughness by crack deflection and blunting, microstructural stability by nature of an interlocking network, and isotropy in these superior properties due to their three-dimensional configuration.  Results obtained from this research will help formulate the scientific framework required to design twin meshes and to implement experimental studies to acquire data for refinement of physical models and enhancement of model predictions.  Ultimately, the strategy of this research program is to establish an original synergistic experimental-modeling approach, which can be implemented to engineer strength and toughness into metals via the novel concept of ""twin mesh engineering."""

Understanding how this process - especially in its earliest stages - took place has the potential to shed light on basic human adaptations.<br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Amanuel Beyin and an international team of colleagues from the US and the Sudan will conduct one season of high-risk archaeological exploration along the Sudanese Red Sea coast (northeast Africa) to locate prehistoric sites associated with early human use of coastal resources and dispersal events out of Africa. There is an emerging anthropological consensus on the first appearance of early modern humans in Africa around 200,000 years ago, and their subsequent dispersals to Europe and Asia. However, there is disagreement about the specific routes along which early humans dispersed out of Africa (e.g. the Sinai Peninsula vs the Bab al Mandab strait). The possibility of early humans using coastal landscapes as potential dispersal conduits during their migration out of Africa and beyond is receiving increasing support among researchers in recent years. As a region featuring a long and heterogeneous coastal strip, the proposed study area in the Sudanese Red Sea zone represents a vital region for assessing current hypotheses concerning early human coastal migration out of Africa. The proposed high-risk archaeological exploration will test the hypothesis that the Red Sea basin served as a viable refugium and dispersal corridor for early humans. <br/><br/>The nature of the research at this stage requires finding paleoanthropological sites, and describing their geological settings and archaeological contents (such as types of artifacts and fossils and their distribution patterns). To achieve these goals, the proposed research will employ vehicle-assisted pedestrian surveys (field team walking along established transects), recording artifact and fossil concentrations with a GPS, and test excavations at selected stratified sites. Field data compiled during this pilot survey will be entered into a Geographic Information System database specifically designed to accommodate site proveniences, artifact/fossil density, locations of important environmental features (river channels, shorelines and stable plateau) and lithic raw material locations. The results of this pilot work will enable us to pursue a long-term, interdisciplinary fieldwork in this important region. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this high-risk exploration are that, by documenting new prehistoric coastal sites from a less explored part of the Red Sea basin, the research will generate fresh archaeological data with which to clarify: a) the role that the African side of the Red Sea basin played in human adaptations, survival and dispersals out of Africa, b) possible demographic and cultural connections among hominid groups who occupied northeastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Southwest Asia and, c) compare the nature of prehistoric human adaption there with neighboring regions. In a wider geographic context, this research will contribute to global theoretical debates surrounding the geographic contexts of early human dispersals out of Africa and the role of coastal habitats in stimulating hominid evolution, adaptations and dispersals. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the project is that, it will contribute to advancing greater international paleoanthropological research collaboration among researchers - including two ethnic minorities in the discipline - from two US institutions and two Sudanese universities.

One approach would be to achieve this employing several catalytic conversion processes, allowing each to be optimized in terms of catalyst employed. Polyols, molecules with multiple OH functionalities, are easily obtainable from cellulosic biomass in known conversion processes. Principal investigators Friederike C. Jentoft and Kenneth M. Nicholas of the University of Oklahoma are proposing to develop novel, heterogeneous catalysts that will convert biomass-derived polyol substrates in liquid phase, hydrophilic media. The target reaction is a deoxydehydration, that is, oxygen and water will be removed simultaneously by reduction and dehydration, respectively. With the help of a sacrificial reducing agent, the net loss of two OH groups from the polyol can be effected, and a versatile olefinic product is obtained.<br/><br/>The primary objectives of this project are to develop supported oxo-metal complexes as catalysts for the deoxydehydration of polyols to olefinic products, to identify the reactive oxo-metal species involved in these processes and to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Achievement of the project?s objective will be facilitated by the synergistic interaction between the Nicholas group in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry and the Jentoft group in the School of Chemical, Biological and Materials Engineering. The groups combine expertise in organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis with expertise in heterogeneous catalysis and spectroscopy. The PIs will explore an array of catalyst compositions, with candidate transition metals for the oxo-complexes being rhenium, molybdenum and vanadium, and candidates for supports being activated carbon, ceria, and layered double hydroxides. The catalytic activity, selectivity and stability of these materials for deoxydehydration of polyols will be tested using sulfites and molecular hydrogen as reducing agents and a variety of conditions and solvents. The key steps in the catalytic deoxydehydration processes will be elucidated by spectroscopically monitoring the interaction of deoxydehydration reductants and glycols with active supported oxo-metal complexes.<br/> <br/>Successful execution of this research project will: 1) establish a new, potentially useful, chemical transformation of cellulosic- and glycolic feedstocks for the sustainable preparation of value-added unsaturated products and intermediates that can be further converted by existing processes; 2) provide fundamental knowledge and understanding of chemical reactions involving carbohydrate/polyol substances, supported metal-oxo species, practical reductants, and suitable reaction media; and 3) supply cutting-edge cross-disciplinary educational and technical training in the key discipline of catalysis for undergraduate and graduate students as well as for postdoctoral researchers."

A second approach is to provide distortion-free reconstructions and accurately located inclusions in human bodies or the Earth's crust. This is achieved by using more realistic descriptions (specifically, spatially varying) of the propagation speed of the waves used to probe the medium of interest.

The development of whole-hand haptic interfaces that allow their wearers to feel and manipulate digital content has been a longstanding goal of engineering research, but has remained far from reality.

Despite decades of effort, commercial production of microalgae-derived biofuels has not emerged because current technologies for microalgae dewatering add a huge cost to the final product, and present a major barrier between algaculture and biofuels. <br/><br/>A knowledge gap exists in the underlying principles governing microalgae dewatering, particularly for the rational design of coagulation agents. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to understand the underlying principles that govern the stability of a colloidal suspension of living cells, and to direct the phase separation of free-floating cells in a controllable fashion. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the rational correlations between inter-algal pair interactions and coagulation-agent structures in order to achieve highly efficient microalgae dewatering at a negligible cost. The central hypothesis is that nanoparticle-pinched polymer brushes, i.e., radiating polymer chains covalently bonded to a nanoparticulate core, are far more effective in dewatering microalgae than conventional flocculants; in addition, using solid-state nanoparticles allows low-cost operations (e.g., using magnetic fields) to be designed to collect algal biomass and retrieve the coagulation agents for multiple cycles of microalgae dewatering, which further reduces the operational cost significantly. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our strongly supportive preliminary data. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that, once the structural characteristics responsible for the unusually high performance of this novel coagulation agent are understood, precise control of its structure is expected to enable unprecedentedly cost-effective microalgae dewatering. Hence the bottleneck preventing commercialization of microalgae-derived biofuels will be cleared. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1. Identify a facile and highly efficient approach to synthesize paramagnetic nanoparticle-pinched polymer brushes with well-defined structures; 2. Determine how the microalgae dewatering efficiency is regulated by the structural characteristics of the coagulation agents; 3. Determine the efficiency of retrieving nanoparticle-pinched polymer brushes for continuous cycles of microalgae growth and dewatering. The expected contribution of this work is to determine the structural characteristics of engineered coagulation agents that endow them with an unusually high efficiency in microalgae dewatering and an unusually low operational cost. This contribution is significant, because it creates a class of super coagulation agents via examining rational correlations between inter-algal pair interactions and flocculants of well-defined structures. This aspect has been poorly understood despite decades of relentless trial-and-error experiments with commercially available chemicals. <br/><br/>Energy and environment represent the top challenges for the sustainable development of our societies. It is well understood that securing renewable energy sources is the grand challenge of our time, but it is not always recognized that any engineered material proposed to address that challenge must be sustainable itself, an example is the design of microalgae coagulation agent in this application. The researchers plan to bring broad societal awareness on this aspect with the following integrated activities: Incorporating research into teaching. The assembled research team will be a nucleus to enhance biofuel research at Mines by giving seminars, developing course materials, and attracting industry sponsorship. The PI will build a webpage devoted to microalgae harvesting issues, and disseminate the video clips of microalgae dewatering experiments to Youtube to advertise sustainable materials for sustainable energy; Outreach to Underrepresented Groups. The researchers plan to build a focused and sustainable outreach program by developing lecture materials and classroom demonstration experiments on algal biofuels, which will be used by the PI and his graduate students, to participate in an existing outreach program at Mines that spans grades kindergarten through the twelfth in two school districts, Adams County District 50 (AC50) and Meeker County (MC).

To make the task of identifying freshwater insects easier and more engaging, the project will develop an innovative educational resource, the Macroinvertebrate Identification Training Environment, that will use zoomable high-resolution images, interactive media, and annotations of diagnostic features to improve perceptual skills.  The goal is to increase the confidence and accuracy of volunteers engaged in identification tasks, while also increasing the reliability and quality of the data they are generating for purposes of scientific research and conservation efforts.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary design research and development project will use networked gigapixel image technology to create a visual environment where users can move seamlessly from full panoramic views of macroinvertebrates to extreme close-ups, with embedded text, images, graphics, audio, and video at various locations and zoom levels. This system will be developed in concert with a cognitive apprenticeship training model designed through a series of design studies.  The design studies will be conducted over a two-year period and will include examination of the distinguishing features of various biomonitoring programs, reviews of existing training materials and strategies, expert performance analysis of professional entomologists, and development of user interface features.  Project developers will collaborate with five regional volunteer biomonitoring organizations to engage a diverse set of volunteers in the design process, including rural populations, older adults, urban youth, and the trainers who support them.  The project work will consist of four integrated strands of activity: design-based learning research, creation of an entomological teaching collection, cyberplatform development, and the external evaluation of the training system.  The resulting Macroinvertebrate Identification Training Environment will be evaluated in terms of its impacts on volunteer accuracy, confidence, and engagement in taxonomic classification activities related to macroinvertebrates.  The impacts of the learning system on trainers and volunteer biomonitoring organizations will also be examined."

Not surprisingly, then, the enhancement of intrinsic touch sensation has received little prior attention.  The PI's overarching goal in this research is to create knowledge and technology for tactile sensing and feedback, in order to realize a glove that enhances touch perception by electronically amplifying tactile sensations, thereby greatly extending the limits of normal human haptic perception.  This will enable its wearer to feel objects with heightened sensitivity, and to discern fine levels of detail in surfaces, objects, or tissues.  Project outcomes will include enabling technologies for hand-worn instruments that can amplify touch much like a hearing aid is able to amplify sound, or a digital microscope can magnify images.  The wearer of such a device will be able to feel defects in surfaces that would not normally be detected, to detect lumps that would otherwise go unnoticed, and to perform fine manipulation tasks that would otherwise be impossible.  Thus, the project holds the potential to impact a wide range of human activities and industries, many of which depend upon manual interaction and inspection.  As part of the current project, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's Department of Neurology, the PI will develop new methods for sensory assessment and guidelines for tactile enhancement with broad implications for clinical applications to the rehabilitation of touch deficits caused by disease or injury affecting the somatosensory system.  Further applications in sensory feedback for upper-limb prosthetics and rehabilitation are envisioned to be directly facilitated by knowledge generated in this way.  <br/><br/>This project will pioneer new methods for electronic sensing of the mechanical stimuli underlying touch sensations in the hand, for computational enhancement of perceptually relevant haptic features, and for reproducing touch sensations via distributed actuators of a wearable, glove-like electronic interface, by integrating work in tactile sensing, computational analysis, distributed actuation and control, and real-time touch amplification.  The PI will design and fabricate new soft computing technologies for capturing, processing, and reproducing touch sensations felt with the hand, in the form of strain and vibration signatures of skin-object contact. Challenges to realizing such a vision include: the multiple time and length scales involved; the complexity of the mechanical stimuli, which consist of complex, movement-dependent distributed strain in the skin; limitations in current knowledge about the fundamental computations underlying sensory processing, which obscure the relevant signal features; and the difficulty of electronically reproducing distributed touch sensations during whole-hand haptic interaction.  The work will contribute to advances in each of these areas, first by designing and fabricating new sensor and actuator technologies, and then by using these to reveal how touch sensation is elicited through contact generated mechanical signals, and how these sensations are processed by the perceptual system."

The partnerships can take many forms including philanthropy, cause marketing, brand certification, and collective impact arrangements. Through communication, the contours of the partnership are made known to different stakeholder groups thereby influencing attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism. The research examines both activists and consumers' reactions to a variety of messages about corporate-NGO partnerships by using a series of three on-line experiments to map both consumers and activists' mental models of corporations and NGOs. This project fulfills three important objectives: (1) to further our understanding of the impact of communicated NGO-corporate partnerships on consumers and activists' attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism, (2) to understand the ways that such messages might overcome initially incongruent pairings through the inclusion of or exclusion of certain message characteristics, and (3) to understand how the different forms of NGO-corporate partnership may moderate these relationships.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold. First, it contributes to the study of semantic networks by investigating factors that shape how individuals' mental models evolve to incorporate new information. Second, this project extends previous marketing research on brand pairings to include a broader spectrum of social issues, stakeholders beyond consumers (i.e., activists), and multiple types of NGO-corporate partnerships. Third, it contributes to a broad-based understanding of the network of NGO-corporate partnerships through its testing of theoretically driven propositions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research offers three broader impacts for educational, policy and industry sectors. First, the project advances social science and computer science interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation by bringing together undergraduate and graduate student researchers. As such, it aims to train a new generation of students in scientific methods. Second, the findings will illuminate why some nonprofits are less likely to be supported by public funding thus allowing policymakers to make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support. Third, as companies seek to improve relationships with consumers and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings will offer industry leaders information regarding how communication influences stakeholders support of partnerships."

Limestone's high solubility allows for the formation of caves that control the flow of water and hydrocarbons below-ground. Understanding the processes that contribute to the formation of caves is thus necessary for improved characterization of water and hydrocarbon resources. In carbonate platform environments where limestones form (e.g. Bahamas, Yucatan and Florida), zones of unsaturated rock (vadose zone) that exceed 60 m in thickness have been proposed to limit movement of organic carbon from soil to the water table, where oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2) would otherwise drive corrosion of limestone bedrock. In contrast to this interpretation, cave systems occur in carbonate platforms at depths of more than 100m below modern sea level. These caves are thought to have formed in contact with fresh groundwater at times in the past when sea level was lower than it is today. Because vadose zones would have been much thicker than 60 m when these caves formed, the geochemical processes responsible for their formation are poorly understood. In this project, the movement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CO2 gas to the water table via vadose zone fast flow routes is hypothesized to provide a mechanism for corroding limestone and create caves beneath thick vadose zones. This hypothesis will be tested on the island of Guam, where tectonic uplift has created vadose zones that are up to 180 m in thickness. Cave formation by CO2 that is produced by biological processes in the deep vadose zone runs contrary to the paradigm that caves in carbonate platforms form as a result of mixing waters of different chemical composition. Concepts explored by this proposal thus have potential to transform understanding of the geomorphology and biogeochemistry of the vadose zone by challenging canonical views that mixing dissolution is the principal agent of dissolution and cave formation in carbonate platform landscapes. This project supports STEM education via the training of two PhD students, providing research opportunities for three undergraduate students as well as developing lesson plans about carbonate aquifers for K-12 teachers and hands-on activities for university-led community outreach programs.<br/><br/>The hypothesis that subsoil respiration of CO2, rather than mixing, dominates dissolution in eogenetic limestone will be tested by collecting vadose gases, infiltration and water at water tables on the island of Guam. Uncased monitoring wells provide access for sampling vadose gases and the aquifer. Air-filled caves allow infiltrating recharge and gases to be collected throughout the vadose zone. Sampling before and after a large rain event will test the influence of fast-flow routes on dissolution. DOC in water samples will indicate whether DOC is transported to the water table and thus whether its oxidation could result in dissolution. CO2 profiles through the vadose zone will be used to determine the depths at which CO2 gas is produced. The overarching hypothesis tested here predicts production of CO2 in the vadose zone and at the water table by oxidation of DOC. CO2 and oxygen concentrations will be used together to determine 1) if vadose zone CO2 is produced by respiration or is degassed from recharging water and 2) if CO2 has been lost to the atmosphere by diffusion (typical of soils and a possible tracer of soil respiration). Dissolution of limestone will be traced using Strontium (Sr) isotopes; Guam was selected for this study because differences in the age of limestone that comprises the vadose and phreatic zone allow use of Sr isotope ratios to discriminate between dissolution in the phreatic zone from dissolution that occurs in the vadose zone followed by transport of solutes into the aquifer."

The discovery of new chemistries of perovskites that possess high Curie transition temperatures are the template for this study; although the computational methodology that is being developed is generic to any class of materials problems. The approach exploits and develops statistical learning and graph theoretic methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that can be used to generate design rules for identifying structure-property relationships in new compounds; and will serve to guide and target DFT calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties. Specifically, the project is developing a rule-based design approach, based on informatics, to identify new chemistries of high temperature piezoelectric perovskites by exploring vast chemical space, so large, that it would otherwise have been prohibitive to study by solely experimental and/or computational methods. The intellectual impact of this work will be to transform the traditional use of computational materials science from one of building large data repositories where informatics is primarily used as a search engine for compounds, to one where data science methods are used as a learning engine to uncover new physics and suggest new directions for conducting detailed computations on promising chemistries that would otherwise remain unidentified.

While effective evidential reasoning based on manual analysis are used in the physical world by law-enforcement agencies, in the cyber world we need automated reasoning methodologies to handle the automated cyber attacks against our nation's information infrastructures every day. This research aims at discovering and developing such automated reasoning methodologies. The problem is  difficult due to the uncertain nature of such reasoning, which is compounded by the characteristics of cyber attacks.<br/><br/>The uncertainty in cyber security comes from two sources. The first is the uncertainty from not knowing the attacker's actions and choices. Since hackers are essentially invisible in the cyberworld, we have to rely upon various types of sensors that report symptoms of potential attacks. The second source of uncertainty comes from these sensors. Since in most cases the symptoms of cyber<br/>attacks significantly overlap with symptoms from benign network activities, it is not possible to rely on a single sensor to give an absolutely correct judgment on whether an attack has happened and succeeded. A key question is how to use these imperfect sensors to conduct reasoning so that one can come up with almost certain conclusions regarding a system's security status. <br/><br/>This challenge of reasoning under uncertainty is not new. In the past four decades computer science researchers have developed an array of reasoning models and methods for uncertainty, especially in the area of artificial intelligence. However, the emergence of cyber threats poses a new<br/>challenge to this problem. The existing methodologies typically require a knowledge-engineering process to build a knowledge model for the problem domain. This has worked reasonably well with the more static and well-behaved problem domains such as disease diagnosis. A key difference between these problem domains and cyber security is that the latter has to deal with an active<br/>malicious attacker who will try to break whatever assumptions made in the reasoning model. For this reason, the knowledge model for cyber security cannot be static because then they can be easily evaded. What will be an effective and practical knowledge engineering approach to handle the uncertainty in cyber security is the biggest open problem that needs to be answered from the<br/>research.<br/><br/>This research adopts an empirical, bottom-up approach to tackle the above challenges. Instead of starting from the existing theories, the PI will start from empirical study on how a human security analysts would reason about cyber events and try to capture the essence of the reasoning in the process. Then, the PI will carry out this empirical study by running intrusion detection sensors on production networks and work with system administrators to understand and reason about the alerts. The next step is to develop a reasoning model that simulates the human reasoning process, and apply the automated reasoning engine on fresh new data to see how it fares. In this spiral theory development process the PI can always make sure that the methodologies are applicable to real cyber-security analysis and constantly find gaps in the model that reveal what will be the most appropriate theories and how to apply them in this problem. The eventual goal is to find the right theoretical framework for reasoning under uncertainty in cyber-security, and validate such theories through repeatable experiments on data from production systems.<br/><br/>This research is tightly integrated into the PI?s education efforts both for students and targeted at the society at large. The empirical nature of the research provides a valuable venue for dialogue between security practitioners and researchers, which will result in a two-way education process: students working on the project can acquire the essential skills of applying advanced knowledge to a practical problem; and security practitioners like system administrators can learn the state-of-the art in cyber security technology through collaborative work with the research team. The empirical study carried out from the research will provide endless data and examples to refresh the materials of the cyber-security courses taught by the PI. New courses with a focus on uncertainty in cyber security defense will be developed. There will be a number of undergraduate students who take part in the research efforts, which will provide a unique education experience for them. Moreover, the test-bed infrastructure produced from the research will also be used as an education platform for the general public about cyber-security problems, with the help of the out-reach programs already established at Kansas State University."

Peter Zhang of the University of South Florida will develop metalloradical catalysis and will seek applications for stereoselective radical reactions. Metalloradical catalysis represents a fundamentally new approach for controlling reactivity and selectivity of radical reactions of both C- and N-centered radicals. Stable metalloradicals such as cobalt(II) porphyrin complexes are capable of activating diazo reagents and organic azides to cleanly generate C- and N-centered radicals, respectively, with nitrogen as the only byproduct in a controlled and catalytic manner. The initially formed C- and N-centered radicals, which remain complexed with cobalt(II) porphyrin complexes and are termed as cobalt-carbene and -nitrene radicals, respectively, can undergo common radical reactions such as radical addition and atom abstraction, but with effective control of reactivity and stereoselectivity by the porphyrin ligand environment. Several factors including the low and appropriate bond dissociation energy of Co-C/Co-N bonds are key for the successful turnover of the Co(II)-based catalytic carbene and nitrene transfers. Through the support of porphyrin ligands with tunable electronic, steric, and chiral environments, this general concept of Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis will be applied for the development of various radical processes, including a number of stereoselective carbene and nitrene transfers.<br/><br/>The concept of metalloradical catalysis may have a far-reaching impact in several areas of research, including carbene, nitrene and radical chemistry. Its establishment will stimulate further development of metalloradical catalyst systems with different combinations of open-shell metal ions and chiral ligands for various stereoselective radical reactions, which have a number of inherent synthetic advantages in comparison with ionic reactions. Since metalloradical catalysis can generate radical intermediates catalytically without the need of stoichiometric initiators such as the commonly employed organotin reagents, it will have a positive environmental impact as well. The biological and medical relevance of porphyrin ligands, together with the well demonstrated practical applications of chiral compounds as pharmaceuticals, flavor and aroma chemicals, agricultural chemicals, and specialty materials, will make the planned study an excellent theme to promote science among the general public, to provide education resources for K-12 teachers, and to stimulate scientific interests of K-12 students."

Since metalloradical catalysis can generate radical intermediates catalytically without the need for stoichiometric initiators such as the commonly employed organotin reagents, the method will have a positive environmental impact. In comparison with the typical need for rare and expensive second- and third-row metal ions to catalyze two-electron ionic reactions, one-electron radical reactions can be carried out effectively with catalysts based on earth-abundant and inexpensive first-row transition metal ions such as cobalt. As such, the development of metalloradical catalysis addresses the increasing need for sustainable catalysts. The proposed project by Professor Zhang integrates research and educational activities. In addition to scientific training for graduate and postdoctoral students, laboratory experiences for high school students and teachers, as well as undergraduate students, are provided.<br/><br/>These new catalytic radical processes, which are both mechanistically distinctive and operationally attractive, serve as valuable synthetic tools for constructing organic compounds, such as biologically important natural products and pharmaceutically interesting small molecules. On the basis of the fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of Co(II)-based radical cyclopropanation and aziridination reactions, new catalytic processes that involve a cascade sequence of radical reactions are in development to allow for the efficient construction of carbocycles and heterocycles beyond three-membered cyclopropanes and aziridines. Through the design and synthesis of chiral porphyrins possessing potential hydrogen bonding capability and with tunable electronic, steric, and chiral environments as the supporting ligands, this project aims to achieve several specific types of Co(II)-catalyzed radical cascade processes. The success of this project may prompt the identification of new metalloradical catalyst systems based on different combinations of open-shell metal ions and chiral ligands that can catalyze a broad range of stereoselective radical reactions."

At high surfactant concentrations in water, these molecules spontaneously form a variety of structurally periodic soft materials known as liquid crystals. Certain liquid crystal structures are particularly useful in practical technical applications, yet these structures are difficult to access and their properties are limited. This project addresses these problems by investigating how adding salts and oils to water/surfactant mixtures enables the formation of these useful liquid crystals. A subset of the resulting materials may find long term application in fields such as therapeutic drug delivery. Another aspect of this project focuses on converting these liquid crystals into useful polymer membranes for energy efficient separations of complex chemical mixtures and for the generation and use of renewable fuels derived from solar energy. The broader impacts of this work include mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in research projects at the boundary between fundamental science and technological innovation, which will is expected to lead to useful materials for future healthcare and renewable energy applications.<br/><br/>This project investigates how small molecule additives control the water concentration-dependent self-assembly of gemini (""twin tail"") dicarboxylate surfactants to form lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs). A special emphasis in this project is placed on identifying methods for stabilizing network phase LLCs with interwoven, periodic, and percolating 3D-networks of aqueous and hydrophobic domains. The influence of various hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic molecular additives on LLC structure formation and stability are being evaluated by polarized light microscopy and temperature-dependent X-ray scattering. These studies are informing the development of mixtures of reactive surfactants and molecular additives that spontaneously form network phase LLCs for subsequent polymerization into functional, nanoporous polymer membranes.

Within a highly interdisciplinary research environment, this project will challenge undergraduate and graduate students to conduct hypothesis-driven, crosscutting research at the interface between chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science. By using modern methods in synthetic polymer chemistry to generate new materials and by characterizing their structures and attendant physical properties, this project will aim to uncover new tools for designing innovative, functional polymers with unusual morphologies and novel properties for a variety of potential applications. An undergraduate polymer chemistry lab and two polymer-oriented lecture demonstrations will be developed for use in general chemistry instruction and in public outreach lectures.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Applications of commodity and specialty block copolymers rely on their useful combinations of properties, which stem from covalently linking two or more dissimilar homopolymer segments into a single macromolecule. By virtue of their thermodynamically driven self-assembly into complex yet well-defined nanoscale morphologies, block copolymers are useful as thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers, advanced molecular separations membranes, and new templates for fabricating next-generation microelectronics. Modern polymerization techniques enable access to a plethora of copolymers containing unusual combinations of chemical functionalities with useful physical properties, at the expense of introducing significant segmental dispersity into one or more blocks of the copolymers. However, the role of broad segmental dispersity on block copolymer phase behavior is not well understood. This project will directly investigate the effects of mid-segment polydispersity on the phase behavior of ABA-type triblock copolymers. Model polydisperse triblock copolymers with varying segmental interaction parameters will be synthesized by tandem polymerization techniques for studies of their composition-dependent phase behavior, using small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, polymer rheology, and various transport measurements. Characterization of samples near the order-disorder transition (ODT) will help to identify the variables that parameterize the phase behavior of these multicomponent block copolymer mixtures. Ultimately this study aims to transform segmental polydispersity into a new tool for manipulating the morphologies of block copolymers with technologically useful bulk properties.<br/>"

This project is based on the premise that organizational and institutional factors - known as governance structures in institutional economics - are as important to Internet routing security as technological design. Internet routing involves decentralized decision making among tens of thousands of autonomous network operators. In this environment, an operator's decisions regarding implementation, organization and monitoring of routing policies powerfully affect the adoption and performance of security technologies.<br/><br/>The research bridges a gap between computer science knowledge of routing and social science theories of organization and networked governance. The interdisciplinary method combines data sets from computer science quantifying the number of routing incidents with network analysis techniques and the insights of institutional economics. Quantitative and qualitative methods are used to assess the relationship between routing security incidents and the governance structures among Internet service providers (ISPs) that affect routing. The research also tests whether deployment of new routing security technologies (e.g. Resource Public Key Infrastructure, RPKI) actually affect the quantity and severity of routing incidents. <br/><br/>Understanding correlations between governance structures and routing security is expected to yield important practical insights for network operators and policy makers in cyber-security. By compiling and rendering usable multiple data sources on routing incidents, the project will contribute to the infrastructure of social science research in cybersecurity. The PI will disseminate the data resources and research results to a broad constituency of academics, policy makers, network operators, industry practitioners, and advocacy groups."

Muddiman of North Carolina State University are supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the use of newly discovered supramolecular liquids called Perfluoro Alcohol Induced Coacervates (PFAIC) for enhanced selective extraction and enrichment of membrane proteins from biological matrices.  Membrane proteins are the most important cell surface membrane constituents.  They act as highly-selective cellular receptors and gatekeepers, regulating the traffic of critical nutrients and energy in and out of the cells.   Solubilization, extraction, and enrichment of membrane proteins from biological samples into aqueous solutions suitable for further analysis - a critical step for the characterization of the individual proteins and for understanding their cellular function - is an area of considerable challenge in contemporary bioanalytical chemistry and molecular biology.  The project promises to tackle this challenge and provide new avenues for the identification of membrane proteins and hence advance our understanding of cellular function and life processes. In the course of conducting the project, graduate and undergraduate students will gain valuable skills in bioanalytical separation technologies, proteomics and mass spectrometry.  Plans are also established, through a partnership with the Kenan Fellows Program of the Kenan Institute at North Carolina State University, to involve high school teachers in summer research and in the development of high school curriculum materials in the general areas related to this research.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of the proposed research is to explore the use of Perfluoro Alcohol Induced Coacervates (PFAIC) for enhanced selective extraction and enrichment of membrane proteins from biological matrices.  The proposed research is organized into four specific aims: (1) to achieve an understanding of the principles of extraction of proteins in PFAIC systems through systematic studies of partitioning patterns, extraction efficiency and enrichment factors of proteins with different structural and physico-chemical properties and  PFAIC systems with different chemical composition; (2) to investigate general strategies for enrichment of membrane proteins into PFAIC phases; (3) to investigate the effectiveness of PFAIC for pre-fractionation, extraction and enrichment of membrane proteins  in shot-gun bottom-up proteomics analysis of yeast as a model biological sample; and (4) to explore the possibility of inducing coacervation of lipid bilayers in cell membranes and concomitant solubilization of the membrane bound proteins."

Within psychology, the distribution of opinions in task groups is one of the dominant factors explaining social influence, with people being influenced by the majority in a group. Within sociology, status characteristics, such as educational attainment, general intelligence, and even gender, have been shown to be related to social influence, with higher status people being more influential over group decision making. This project examines how the distribution of opinions and relative status combine to affect social influence. As such, it contributes to research and theory in sociology and psychology, and also contributes to generalizable knowledge regarding how the structure of task groups may shape their outcomes. <br/><br/>Two laboratory studies constitute the empirical component of this project. The first uses highly controlled protocols to isolate the joint effects of status and the distribution of opinions on social influence. The experimental procedures ensure other factors are not explaining variations in social influence. The second study applies the theory to groups of individuals that will be recruited from the broader community. Specifically, groups of three or six people will be invited to the laboratory to participate in an open interaction session. They will be asked to form an opinion about a task, to share that opinion with the group, and then asked for their final opinions. Changes in initial opinions constitutes social influence, and is expected to follow from status processes and the distribution of opinions in predictable ways. These groups will systematically vary in their composition by gender, age, occupation, and race. Statistical modeling will be employed to discern the effects of status and the distribution of opinions on social influence."

The reason for this requirement is that, according to the classical theory, image reconstruction from truncated CT data (the so-called ""interior problem"") is non-unique. As a consequence, many aspects of truncated data inversion have not been studied in literature. In this project the PIs will theoretically analyze the problem of image reconstruction from truncated data with minimal prior knowledge. Both transmission CT and emission tomography (SPECT) with constant attenuation will be addressed. The PIs will study the questions of stability of the reconstructions in 2D and 3D, characterize the null-space of an integral transform arising in the interior problem, and analyze eigenfunctions of certain singular Sturm-Liouville problems. The PIs will also develop efficient algorithms for numerical solution of the interior problem. These algorithms will be implemented and tested using both simulated and real data. <br/><br/>At present, interior tomography is at the cusp of being directly applicable in general medical imaging diagnostics. The confluence of theoretical, algorithmic, computational, and technological advances gives the PIs hope that interior tomography can move from the ""drawing boards"" to practical medical imaging in the not so distant future. While there are still some open research problems, the results obtained recently show that the problems can be solved with a fairly high degree of confidence. If successful, this study will provide theoretically justified and practically applicable two and three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms for imaging a region of interest inside an object (e.g., the patient) from truncated data. The broader impact of the proposed research lies in the promise it holds for improvements in the practice of clinical medicine and biomedical science generally, as well as for industrial non-destructive testing. The most direct benefit is the reduction in the x-ray dose to the patient; other benefits include less expensive scanners, improved temporal resolution, increased scanner throughput, capability of imaging larger objects, reduced system cost, etc."
