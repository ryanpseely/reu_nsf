The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow, Tristan Nunez, and will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The fellow's research asks whether animals can help plants move in response to a changing climate. Plants have to follow the climatic conditions that are right for each species. Many plants depend on animals to move their seeds for them, but the loss of wildlife habitat has made it harder for animals to move freely. The fellow will use innovative computer models to test whether animals could disperse plants in the right direction, and quickly enough, to enable plants to track expected future changes in climate. Herbarium collections will provide information on where plants are found and the timing of seed production. Online databases will provide information on the timing and direction of animal movements. This research will help scientists better understand the development of ecological communities and patterns of plant species diversity and distribution. The maps and predictions coming from this research can help ranchers, farmers, foresters, and land and wildlife managers understand how a changing climate might alter where important plants are found. This will help society manage ecologically and culturally important plant species, such as huckleberries and other traditional foods, and also better understand the spread of invasive species.  <br/><br/>The research will assess the hypothesis that species traits related to animal movement direction and rate and plant seed phenology will mediate plant range shifts. Species distribution and phenology models for multiple North American genera of berries and forbs will allow projection of the timing and distribution of plant seed availability in the present as well as in the future. State-space and network flow models of bear, bird, and ungulate movements will describe spatial patterns of animal seed dispersal relative to the future niche spaces of plants. Findings will be communicated through a museum exhibit and on platforms supporting indigenous communities and managers in understanding the effects of global change on traditional foods, wildlife, and ecosystems. The fellow will be mentored by Dr. Laura Prugh, a wildlife ecologist, and Dr. Janneke Hille Ris Lambers, a plant community ecologist, at the University of Washington. The opportunity will further the fellow's academic training, by broadening the research focus to include plant-animal interactions and phenology, and through development of a network of academic and agency collaborations and outreach opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Her project is aimed at assessing environmental changes in the western US during and after the Younger Dryas, an abrupt climate change event that occurred approximately 12,000 years ago. She will analyze sediment cores from an elevational transect of lakes in the Teton Range, Wyoming, to investigate how glaciers and montane ecosystems responded to a long cold interval followed by rapid warming.  Key questions in both the earth sciences and biological sciences will be addressed, including: 1) how do alpine glaciers respond to rapid climate oscillations? 2) how quickly can treeline elevation and species' ranges shift in response to warming at rates comparable to the modern? and 3) how do coupled glacial-ecological systems co-evolve under rapid climate change? Dr. Crump will engage broad audiences in this paleo-example of abrupt climate change through popular science articles and accessible public talks. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates at UCSC and Occidental, as well as field-based educational experiences for high school groups, with a focus on broadening participation in the earth sciences. <br/><br/>The Younger Dryas was an abrupt ~1200-year return to glacial conditions during the latest Pleistocene that was likely caused by a temporary collapse of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. While this event is widely recognized as an archetypal example of abrupt climate change driven by a mechanism that may come into play in the near future, its impacts on distal terrestrial environments remain sparsely documented. Leveraging high-resolution lacustrine sediment records from a network of lakes spanning a bioclimate gradient in the Teton Range, Dr. Crump will use elemental data from scanning x-ray fluorescence to constrain glacier extent before, during, and after the Younger Dryas. She will then analyze sedimentary ancient DNA in the lake cores to reconstruct plant communities through time, thereby constraining the rate of treeline response to a rapid climate oscillation. This project takes advantage of recent developments in genetic techniques to answer essential earth science questions and advance the growing field of molecular paleoecology. The resulting paleoenvironmental constraints on the spatial scale and magnitude of ocean circulation changes driving abrupt climate change will be relevant to multiple scientific communities spanning the geological and life sciences.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. All species occur within a limited area known as their geographic range. Range limits can form without an obvious physical barrier because competition with other species prevents further expansion, because they are unable to adapt to a new environment, or because there are too few individuals of the same species to reproduce effectively. Many tropical organisms have narrow elevational ranges, meaning they occur only for a short vertical distance on continuous mountain slopes. This allows many species to coexist in a small area, and is part of why the tropics have so many species. However, we know relatively little about what determines elevational ranges in the tropics. The fellow will use DNA sequence data from extensive museum collections of Andean birds to understand the role of evolutionary and ecological processes in forming range limits. By understanding how these processes interact, we can better predict how species will respond to human induced environmental change. This has broad implications for biodiversity conservation and human health as endangered species and new diseases experience a warming world. <br/><br/>The fellow will evaluate alternate hypotheses for species range limits by comparing the spatial distribution of genetic variation of tropical songbird species that have either narrow (<1500 m) or broad (>3000 m) elevational ranges. Using dense geographic sampling in extant biological collections from the Peruvian Andes, he will generate genome-wide DNA sequence data from across the full elevational ranges of 8 phylogenetically independent lineages. Each lineage will contain both elevational specialist and elevational generalist species. He will first use these data to identify the evolutionary and ecological processes that determine elevational ranges in Andean birds. Comparing observed patterns with predictions validated by simulations, he will evaluate the relative contribution of decreasing effective population size, biotic interactions, and migration from maladapted populations to the formation of equilibrium range limits. He will then test whether functional variation in hemoglobin is a prerequisite for elevational range expansion, and characterize whether adaptive variants have undergone hard or soft selective sweeps. During his postdoctoral research, the fellow will undergo training in museum curation and biodiversity informatics, advanced statistical genomics, and functional genetics. The research will be based at University of New Mexico, a majority-minority R1 institution, where the fellow will serve as a mentor in a training program for underrepresented students interested in research careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Strong collaborations between the fellow, Humboldt State University, the Yurok Tribe of California, the Spokane Tribe of Washington, and Redwood National Park will serve as a model for facilitating research under various management types.  The fellow will focus on Traditional Ecological Knowledge and a genetic analysis of elk fecal samples from Yurok ancestral lands and the Spokane reservation to identify individuals and diet.  The fellow will also conduct outreach activities in both tribal communities, as well as, at national conferences and Humboldt State University.  The project and outreach activities will serve tribal communities by highlighting Indigenous science and providing opportunities to inspire and engage people of all ages in science.  The research will serve the broader society by providing an example of an integrated scientific approach, as well as contributing to the scientific literature on genetic diversity and diet of these elk populations.<br/><br/>Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge as related to elk will be integrated with the Yurok portion of this study through the analysis of interviews with Yurok-affiliated community members.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Many species are threatened because of climate change and human impacts. By examining how species lived before human environmental influences, we can help mitigate future environmental change. This project studies Pacific kelp forests. Today, these nearshore habitats are vulnerable because of their proximity to large cities. The fellow will use chemical techniques to quantify the importance of kelp to ancient fish and marine mammals using bones collected from archaeological sites. Sites range from Alaska to southern California, and date from 12,000 years ago to modern day. Additionally, the fellow will characterize nutrient flow between kelp forests and nearby open ocean habitats. Overall, this project provides a picture of what habitats along the Pacific coast of North America looked like prior to European contact. The work is important not just for species living in kelp forests, but for human communities relying on them. The fellow will present this research to visitors at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), and develop learning modules for high schools and scientific researchers. <br/><br/>This research will examine the dynamics of Pacific kelp forest ecosystems over the Holocene and Anthropocene. Incorporating data from archaeological contexts adds to our understanding of these ecosystems by providing a pre-industrial baseline. The fellow will conduct delta13-C analysis of essential amino acids (EAA) on faunal remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct the importance of kelp-derived energy to ancient food webs. Sites span the northeast Pacific margin and past 12,000 years. At each location, the fellow will analyze fauna from three distinct functional groupings benthic, pelagic or mixed-habitat foragers to quantify kelp versus pelagically-derived energy. The fellow will compare these to analogous modern fauna to characterize ecosystem change. The fellow will work at the Smithsonian NMNH, a premier research and educational institute and popular cultural attraction. The fellow will: 1) learn important curatorial and faunal identification skills, and 2) interact directly with the general public about the importance of kelp forest ecosystems. The fellow will also develop curriculum based around historical conservation ecology for use in high schools. This research aids in understanding kelp forests dynamics, and engages scientists and the public in their protection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways.  When hybridization occurs (the exchange of genetic information) between two species, genetic variants (known as alleles) that originated in one species may be introduced into another species. Evidence from DNA sequencing in vertebrates so far suggests that most introduced alleles are removed by natural selection. However, sometimes introduced alleles are beneficial and impact important traits like pesticide-resistance and coat color. Understanding the role of natural selection to eliminate or promote introduced alleles is essential to learning how wild populations adapt to their environments, but this has not been well studied. In this project, the fellow will identify introduced alleles and genes related to environmental adaptation in two closely-related bird species that hybridized historically. If alleles related to environmental adaptation in one species are found in the other, this will reveal a positive role for selection on introduced alleles. By using new sequencing techniques, working with undergraduates and creating an online educational lesson, the fellow will develop skills required to succeed as a researcher and teacher.<br/><br/>	To examine the dual role of natural selection on introduced alleles, the fellow will characterize selection and introgression in two species with different colonization histories to high elevation. The lack of environmental oxygen (hypoxia) at high elevation presents a chronic selective pressure on residents with high metabolic rates like birds, and many species that occupy high elevation possess derived genetic adaptations. The fellow previously documented genome-wide introgression between the Bolivian Hooded siskin, a recent colonist to high elevation, and the Black siskin, a high elevation specialist, as well as directional introgression of two high-elevation associated loci. With this framework, the fellow will test for evidence of adaptive introgression genome-wide in the Bolivian Hooded siskin. To examine if natural selection has favored the introgression of high-elevation adapted alleles into the Bolivian Hooded siskin, the fellow will (1) test if a disproportionate number of alleles with Black-siskin ancestry in the Bolivian Hooded siskin are in genes associated with hypoxia adaptation, and (2) if these hypoxia-related genes from the Black siskin bear a signature of positive selection in the Bolivian Hooded siskin. This study will demonstrate if adaptive introgression has played a critical role in the persistence of the Bolivian Hooded siskin at high elevation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Host-microbe associations are common in nature and the goal of the project is to understand how microbes evolve to benefit their hosts. For a beneficial microbe (called a  symbiont) to persist in the host population for many generations, it has to be passed on from parent to offspring (called vertical transmission), or taken up from the environment between unrelated hosts (called horizontal transmission). Theory suggests that transmission mode has a critical role in how symbionts will evolve. However, there has been little research to test this idea. This project will determine how transmission mode affects symbiont evolution using an experimental system. Because microbes have considerable influence on their hosts, understanding how symbionts evolve will also provide insight into the evolution of hosts themselves. Components of this research will be implemented at the middle school and undergraduate levels to promote interest in biology in underrepresented groups. At the middle school level, the fellow will teach microbe-based modules to refugee girls to increase awareness of microbes (beneficial and harmful). At the undergraduate level, the fellow will recruit students from minority-serving programs to participate in a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), where students will conduct their own research based on the fellow's project. <br/><br/>The bacterium Pseudomonas mendocina protects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from the pathogenic bacterium, P. aeruginosa. The fellow will passage P. mendocina between hosts in the presence or absence of P. aeruginosa while simulating vertical and horizontal transmission. After 15 passages, the fellow will measure P. mendocina growth rates and host survival, and assess genomic and transcriptomic changes in the bacterium. Additionally, the fellow will conduct a meta-analysis of the current literature to determine whether experimental findings align with systems in nature. The fellow will receive training in microbial characterization techniques, sequence analysis, and meta-analysis. The fellow will also gain teaching and communication skills through establishing a CURE and implementing science modules at a local middle school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to understand the historical significance of host-associated microbes (microbes that live inside another organism. These include bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. By using museum collections of amphibians, the fellow will examine host-associated gut microbes over time in two regions of the United States. Amphibian museum specimens are especially useful in this regard because of the way in which these specimens were preserved. These specimens preserved fluids, which provide a snapshot of the host-associated microbes at the time of collection. This work will have important impacts on host-associated microbe ecology and evolution. Additionally, the proposed work will involve the participation of Native American students from reservations in South Dakota to expand scientific interest and careers among this underrepresented group.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that microbial gut communities will vary in diversity and function both within and between amphibian assemblages over spatiotemporal gradients. Such changes may also precede disease related declines of the associated hosts, such as chytridiomycosis in amphibians. These hypotheses will be tested by utilizing recently developed techniques for isolation and purification of degraded DNA. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing will be used for generating host-associated gut metagenome data. Sequence-based taxonomic and functional analysis will be completed using a variety of bioinformatics and machine-learning software on high-performance computing resources.  By utilizing museum specimens and their associated locality information, the fellow will also explicate changes in host-associated microbiomes of amphibian assemblages in response to differential land-use and land-cover (LULC) in the Midwest and Northeast United States from the 1880s to present. Statistical mixed-effects models will be implemented for evaluating changes in host-associated microbial metagenomes and will include the integration of publicly available LULC datasets. The project will therefore further the training of the fellow in GIS for integration into microbial ecology research, and also promote the mentoring of students from underrepresented groups in using museum collections for answering questions pertaining to microbial ecology and evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will address this need through integrative analysis of phenotypic data collected from natural history specimens and newly-generated genomic data from representatives across the swallow genus Hirundo. Because Hirundo includes lineages at various stages of the speciation continuum and considerable phenotypic variation in mate choice traits, it is an ideal system to test for empirical evidence that the coupling of barrier loci underlying selected traits drives speciation. Further, this research will thoroughly examine the genomic architecture of speciation by quantifying genetic diversity, the recombination landscape, and genomic composition and structure in regions underlying mate-choice traits. Ultimately, this study will integrate analyses of phenotypic data and comparative population genomics to test the importance of coupling between divergent traits in the process of speciation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rainforest canopy remains one of the most diverse yet understudied areas of earth's biology. Epiphytes, such as orchids, ferns, and mosses, live in the canopy. These aerial plants are highly diverse, contribute to important ecosystem processes, and provide vital resources for animals. Epiphytes, however, are being threatened by logging and the effects of a changing climate across the world. This research, therefore, also has implications for conservation. The project aims to understand how epiphytes assemble, change over time, and maintain a diverse and healthy community. Epiphytes will be analyzed in the canopies of forests in the Pacific Northwest and Panama. The Fellow will continue work promoting a more inclusive scientific community by teaching, mentoring, and leadership in Spanish and English. <br/><br/>The Fellow's research will directly contribute to the longstanding theoretical debate between colonization versus niche processes as drivers of plant community assembly. If niche processes are the primary driver of community assembly, epiphytes will be sorted by host species (the Host Tree Species Specificity Hypothesis), by height strata (the Vertical Niche Stratification Hypothesis), and by orientation to the ground. Alternatively, if colonization processes are the primary mediator of epiphyte assembly, propagule availability will be a better predictor of subsequent diversity than microhabitat (the Dispersal Limitation Hypothesis). To test these hypotheses, the Fellow will establish 540 epiphyte-free permanent sampling plots throughout the profile of 30 epiphyte-laden focal trees in both temperate and tropical rainforests, experimentally manipulating substrate height and orientation. Each year, the Fellow will survey all plots to quantify changes in the diversity and composition of the re-establishing epiphyte communities. The work involves collaboration internationally and with the New York Botanical Garden, which will contribute to training in taxonomy, DNA sequencing and provide a new ecosystem.

The fellow will study how newly formed hydropower reservoirs in Cambodia's Mekong watershed contribute carbon from methane to aquatic food webs. Reservoirs are well known sources of the greenhouse gas methane to the atmosphere, which is usually counted against hydropower. If this methane produced carbon also supports fish at the top of the food webs after reservoirs are created, these reservoirs can be said to enhance river productivity, fishing, and economic prosperity. The fellow will analyze carbon in fish tissue samples gathered from a tributary of the Mekong (the Sesan River) before and after it was altered by having a dam built upon it. Hydropower is expanding on large tropical rivers like the Mekong, so it is important to understand how its ecological impacts may vary.  The fellow will also replicate this study in Washington's Snake River to provide a comparison to an aging hydropower system.<br/><br/>Previous work has shown that the majority of microbial production in lake sediments may be anaerobic, such as methanogenesis. Yet, estimates of Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) within aquatic ecosystems ignore methanogenesis or chemoautotrophic primary production. Methane produced here is highly depleted in one of two abundant stable carbon isotopes, carbon-13, relative to other carbon sources. This depletion serves as a useful tracer for methane as a carbon source to aquatic food webs. On reservoir floodplains with dynamic water levels and steep oxygen and redox gradients, this methane may be oxidized by members of the microbial community known as methanotrophs. Because aerobic oxidation does not affect carbon ratios, the isotopic signature of methanogenesis is conserved as it is transferred from methanotrophs to zooplankton and fish in higher trophic levels. The fellow will carry out mass spectrometry on historical fish tissue samples from the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.  The fellow will also measure in-situ rates of photosynthesis and coupled methane production and oxidation upstream of both the Sesan and Snake River dams to a) determine geographic variability in primary production at the base of reservoir food webs and b) more accurately account for oxidative processes in estimates of NEP.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Ecosystem management in a changing world is essential for maintaining ecosystem resources that are economically or environmentally beneficial to humans. However, when management focuses on maximizing a single resource, tradeoffs can occur that reduce other resources unintentionally. Predicting how ecosystem resources will respond to management actions and climatic change is especially important in heavily managed systems such as commercial fisheries of Pacific salmon. In addition to the economic benefits of salmon fisheries, salmon transport large quantities of nutrients and food resources from the ocean to freshwater ecosystems during their spawning migrations. The eggs and salmon carcasses provided by the migrations are essential for sustaining resident trout and brown bear populations in Alaska. Both species provide sport and subsistence fishing and hunting opportunities that are culturally and economically valuable to local communities.  Commercial salmon fisheries primarily harvest fish in the ocean prior to entering freshwater habitats, thereby reducing the quantity of resources that are transported to freshwater ecosystems. The competing resources create a tradeoff between the harvest in salmon fisheries and the nutrient flux that supports resident trout and brown bear populations. To maximize both ecosystem resources, it is important to understand how each respond to changes in climate and fisheries management practices. This research will provide a new understanding of how fisheries management and increased temperature impact the quantity of resources transported by salmon and identify the best management practices to minimize tradeoffs and maximize benefits for a diverse group of stakeholders. <br/><br/>The fellow will use long-term datasets from Bristol Bay, AK combined with simulation modeling techniques to identify fisheries management practices that maximize ecosystem services. The specific research objectives are: 1) construct a bioenergetic model to evaluate the impact of increased stream temperatures and commercial harvest scenarios on resident stream fish growth; 2) develop a population model that evaluates the effect life-history changes in sockeye salmon on resource subsidies provided to freshwater habitats; and 3) test stocking and harvest scenarios that maximize both resource subsidies and commercial returns. The fellow will support broader participation in fisheries science by participating in and organizing the Native Peoples Fisheries Section of American Fisheries Society and by establishing a fisheries training and internship program for Native youth.  The fellow will receive training in simulation modeling, teaching, and working with under-represented groups that will advance their career in aquatic ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. All complex life relies on the function of multiple distinct sets of DNA contained in each cell. Mitochondria, the compartment of the cell responsible for energy production and multiple other functions, contain a separate genome encoding critically important genes. Differences between individuals in their mitochondrial DNA have consequences on organismal function, but little is known about how these changes contribute to the evolution of new traits. The fellow will leverage the power of a collection of diverse yeast species to build the largest dataset of mitochondrial genomes available for any single group of species and determine how variation in mitochondrial DNA contributes to two key innovations that differ among yeasts: the ability to grow at different temperature extremes and the ability to ferment sugars even in the presence of oxygen. The project will significantly advance our understanding of how mitochondrial genomes adapt and change with their environment. The fellow will develop an evolution education outreach initiative to provide learning resources to homeschooling communities in Wisconsin.<br/><br/>Mitochondrial DNA variation contributes to complex phenotypes in diverse organisms but mitochondrial evolution remains poorly understood. The fellow proposes to use genomic resources generated through the Y1000+ Project and the USDA strain collection to test hypotheses of mitochondrial genome evolution in over 1,000 diverse budding yeast species spanning 400 million years of evolution. The fellow will generate the largest collection of mitochondrial genomes currently available for any eukaryotic subphylum by creating and annotating de novo assemblies. Mitochondrial sequences will be used to test two hypotheses: 1) whether mitochondrial variation contributes to the expansion of yeast species into novel thermal environments, and 2) whether the evolution of aerobic fermentation has led to reduced purifying selection on mitochondrial genes. Mitochondrial genome variation will be associated with phenotypic data from laboratory testing of temperature preferences and metabolic traits for each species. The proposed research will provide significant training to the fellow through meetings with the Sponsor and Y1000+ Project collaborators, peer and near-peer mentoring activities with lab members, and writing funding applications with the Sponsor's guidance. The fellow will develop an outreach program to local homeschooling communities in Wisconsin that will serve as a framework for future outreach. The fellow will survey homeschooling communities, workshop best practices for outreach together with parents, and provide suggestions and lesson plans for incorporating evolution into the homeschooling curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A slightly more involved example is when the function is not symmetric to all its inputs -- as an example, in the European Union, each country is assigned a different ""weight"" and a motion passes or fails depending on whether or not the ""weighted majority"" votes yes or no. Such a classification rule (or Boolean function) is called a linear threshold function (LTF) in mathematics and appears frequently in a diverse range of areas including machine learning, computational complexity theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, voting theory and even neuroscience (where they were first studied as a way to model neurons in the human brain). While simple and intuitive from a definitional point of view, LTFs are sometimes inadequate to model more complicated types of classification rules (useful in areas such as machine learning). In this project, the investigator will study two natural generalizations of LTFs which are significantly more expressive than LTFs and overcome this barrier; on the other hand, their definitional proximity to LTFs make them amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. Aside from studying these functions through the lens of computational complexity theory, this project will also explore applications of these functions to areas such as machine learning, quantum computing and information theory (i.e., the mathematical theory of communication). The project will train graduate students who will achieve fluency in complexity theory and one or more of these application areas. In addition, several of these topics will also be incorporated in a new graduate course on Boolean functions taught by the investigator at the University of Pennsylvania. <br/> <br/><br/>The first generalization is a so-called ""Polynomial threshold function"" (or PTF) which, roughly speaking, allows us to model ""higher order effects"" (as opposed to LTFs which only allow for ""linear effects"" of the inputs). The second generalization is a so-called ""Intersection of LTFs"" which is a Boolean function obtained by applying several LTFs at once.  Intersection of LTFs are also a special case of convex bodies, a widely studied object in computer science and mathematics. Jointly referred to as threshold functions, these function classes admit simple geometric interpretations but remain poorly understood from a complexity theoretic point of view. The investigator will study these functions from three distinct vantage points: (i) Derandomization -- i.e., design of efficient deterministic algorithms to compute the probability that a random input satisfies a given threshold function. (ii) Property testing -- i.e., given black-box access to a function, design of an efficient algorithm to test the hypothesis that the given function is a threshold function (either a PTF or an intersection of LTFs).

The research component of this fellowship investigates the evolution of exaggerated animal weapons. Examples of such weapons include the branching antlers of deer, the enlarged claws of crabs, and the elongated horns of beetles. At their extremes, these weapons can compose up to half of an individual's body mass (e.g., claws in fiddler crabs) and can be more than twice an individual's body length (e.g., front legs in harlequin beetles). Moreover, these weapons can dramatically differ in their size and shape among closely related species. The fellow will specifically investigate the factors that promote this weapon variation. Investigating the evolution of animal weapons can provide insights into: 1) arms-races between weapons and defensive structures, 2) the importance of plant diversity in driving animal diversity, and 3) other factors that promote new morphological structures. The broader impacts associated with this fellowship include undergraduate mentoring, enhancing and expanding the digitization of museum collections, and the production of scientific research videos for the public. <br/><br/>The fellow will use data from museum specimens in combination with phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the degree to which male-male competition promotes phenotypic diversification and speciation in leaf-footed bugs (Insecta: Hemiptera: Coreidae). Specifically, the fellow will test multiple weapon diversification hypotheses and determine the extent to which male-male competition influences speciation and net diversification. Because the role of male-male competition in diversification has been largely neglected, this research will help clarify whether selection via differential access to mates generally promotes phenotypic diversification and speciation or whether such patterns are specific to female choice.

This research will focus on cycads, an unusual group of seed plants that originated around 270 million years ago. Today, cycads are among the most threatened plants on Earth, with approximately 65% of species at risk of extinction. Cycads have many distinctive biological features that can offer significant insights into the evolution of plant function. However, almost nothing is known about their ecology and physiology, making this project critical to understanding the evolution of seed plant function, a story that is as critically endangered as the species themselves. Indeed, lawmakers and conservationists are desperate for tools to save these enigmatic plants from extinction. Thus, this project will provide new insights into one of the earliest examples of land plant seed biology by addressing major gaps in basic aspects of cycad biology, while simultaneously producing transformative data and tools, including those critical to address the urgent threats to cycad survival in South Africa.<br/><br/>This project will address the two greatest human-imposed threats to South African cycad survival, 1) illegal poaching, which is the most significant immediate threat to survival, and 2) a changing climate, which is the greatest threat to long-term survival. The project addresses these threats by using recently developed protocols in forensic isotope ecology, evolutionary physiology, and species distribution modelling. The largest herbarium collection of cycads in Africa at the National Herbarium in South Africa, and one of the most extensive living research collections of cycads in the world, maintained at the Montgomery Botanical Center in Miami, FL will be leveraged for extensive data collections. As part of this this research, the fellow will develop key professional proficiencies including 1) mentorship skills by leading an inclusive group of undergraduates in research, and 2) teaching skills by working with the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (University of Wisconsin-Madison) to develop, implement, and publish effective learning strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Coevolution between animals and the microorganisms they live with (microbial symbionts) often results in changes such as novel molecules, that can protect the host organism. If the microbial symbionts are passed from parent to offspring it is usually an advantage when the environment stays the same. In contrast, marine ecosystems, which often experience change, may provide an advantage to organisms that acquire their microbial symbionts from the environment. This project will analyze the interaction of a marine crustacean called an  isopod with microbes called cyanobacteria. The research will use this model system of marine symbioses to test evolutionary theories about how organisms coevolve. The fellow will simultaneously develop a bridge program focused on providing marine science research opportunities to underrepresented community college students, thus giving students training unavailable at their home institutions. In doing so, the project will provide training in population genomics, meta-genomics, and scientific diving.<br/><br/>Reef-dwelling isopods (Santia) cultivate dual-purpose, cyanobacteria - these symbionts are the isopod's primary food source and provide defense from predation. Defense is conferred via conspicuous warning coloration and compounds that are unpalatable to predatory fishes. Theory predicts these symbionts should be a diverse and undifferentiated microbial assemblage, consistent with the 'Everything is Everywhere' hypothesis. However, Santia brood their young, which should favor vertical transmission and co-diversification. This research will use microbial community profiling to determine whether symbiont benefits derive from a consortium of microbial species or a single specialized lineage. Symbiont transmission will be determined by comparing isopod geographic population structure against spatial patterns of symbiont genetic population and community structure. Isopod and symbiont co-divergence will be examined using comparative phylo-genomics with an isopod-symbiont system lacking defensive compounds and pigment. The fellow will create a 'Marine Science Pathways (MSP)' program that will act as a feeder to 'The Diversity Project' a research-intensive international summer program focused on increasing diversity in marine science by providing a pathway to PhD programs. MSP will recruit underrepresented students from community colleges to conduct research and participate in a journal club where PhD students who are TDP alumni will discuss science and paths to graduate school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how natural communities are structured is a fundamental question in ecology, with important implications for conservation. According to ecological theory, the number of species, and abundance of each species in a community is affected by how species' traits, such as size and growth rate, interact with the environment. This project investigates how precipitation and biological soil crusts (biocrusts are communities of moss, lichen, cyanobacteria and other biota that cover soil surfaces among vascular plants in drylands) influence plant species growing in dryland communities. The research will test ecological theory to determine the factors that influence native and invasive species plant establishment in dryland ecosystems.

Understanding how rainfall patterns and biocrusts influence plant establishment will inform directed community reassembly for restoration purposes. Outreach activities include collaboration with the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars program to mentor a diverse cohort of students dedicated to conservation.

He develops computational methods to study the properties of negatively charged molecules called molecular anions. The presence of extra electrons (negative charges) can alter the strengths of the chemical bonds in a molecule.  A chemical bond is formed when electrons are shared between nearby atoms.  These shared electrons act like a ""glue"" that hold the atoms together to form a molecule. However, the presence of either too little or too much glue can weaken a chemical bond.  If the bond is weakened enough, a molecular anion can become metastable and the bond can be easily broken. Alternatively, the metastable molecular anion can undergo a rearrangement and release an electron so that it can go back to having stronger, more stable bonds. Examples of areas in which these phenomena are applied are the etching of integrated circuits, studies involving chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere, radiation damage to living tissue, and some cancer therapies.  Dr. Sommerfeld develops computer models of metastable anions. Making computer models of metastable anionic molecules is a challenge because one needs to simulate the quantum mechanical equations of motion describing all the electrons in the metastable anion, as well as all the electrons of all possible rearranged species that result from the released electron.  Dr. Sommerfeld's goal is to identify a reliable, cost-efficient method to calculate the time it takes for electron release, a critical parameter for characterizing metastable anions. The project is being carried out at Southeastern Louisiana University, a predominantly undergraduate institution. Professor Sommerfeld engages lower income and underrepresented students in research projects involving high-level theory and sophisticated computational methods. In order to introduce undergraduates to this research, he also designs educational mini-projects using standard quantum chemistry methods,so that his students can be introduced to the research area step-by-step. <br/><br/><br/>In this project Dr. Sommerfeld studies electronically metastable states, so called resonance states, or resonances. He develops first-principles methods that characterize resonances and employs these methods to study electron-induced reactions. Computing both the energy and lifetime of a resonance is a challenging task for quantum chemistry because it combines an electron-scattering phenomenon with an electron-correlation problem. Dr. Sommerfeld pursues objectives that aim at improving the accuracy and reliability of one of the existing methods used to compute the energy of resonances and he pursues more specific projects aimed at implementing a set of reliable methods in systematic steps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Uncovering the relationships between these coupled environmental stressors and their impact on the feeding behavior of marine top predators (e.g., marine mammals, sea turtles) is critical to our understanding of the functioning, health, resilience, and adaptation of marine ecosystems to environmental disturbance. This project will apply cutting-edge molecular chemistry techniques to archived marine mammal and sea turtle tissues from multiple research collections to examine how foraging strategies and food web structure have changed since the late 19th century in response to changes in climate and fishing. Such information can be used to predict how marine predators and the food webs they control will respond to future ecosystem change in the upcoming century.<br/><br/>The project will use amino acid isotope geochemistry to reconstruct changes in critical parameters of food web architecture (e.g., trophic position, niche breadth, food web baseline) supporting common bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, and loggerhead sea turtles in the western North Atlantic since the late 1800's. Specifically, these data will be used to test three key hypotheses: 1) do decadal shifts in ocean productivity associated with major climatic shifts cause expansion/contraction of marine top predator trophic niches, 2) do declining prey and predator abundances cause marine top predators to compensate by foraging at lower trophic levels or expanding their trophic niches, 3) does increased interspecific competition from the recovery of sympatric species cause trophic niches to contract. This multi-species approach will resolve conflicting accounts of trophic response to environmental change.

Fish entered the deep sea many times from shallow habitats, where most marine life on Earth lives. It has long been thought that evolution proceeds slowly in the cold and dark environment of the deep sea (defined as below 200 meters). In conflict with this view, however, many deep-sea families have a surprising diversity of species and body forms. By combining a family history of shallow and deep fish lineages with 3-D scans of fish specimens, the fellow will understand how quickly deep-sea forms evolved relative to the pace of evolution in their shallow relatives. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of the formation of biodiversity in the world's oceans. <br/><br/>The project will integrate diverse data types including time-calibrated molecular phylogenies, palaeoceanographic proxy data for past oceanic conditions, and 3-D scans of preserved fish specimens. The first objective is to reconstruct ancestral depth and habitat types on a large phylogeny of all ray-finned fishes. This will allow the fellow to identify the number and timing of all known transitions to the deep sea, as well as possible conditions that favor such transitions such as life habits or oceanographic conditions. Broad-scale analyses across fishes will be paired with detailed investigations within three focal groups of varying ages with both shallow and deep members (lizardfishes, anglerfishes, and snailfishes). The fellow will collect 3-D microcomputed tomography scans to analyze the rate and direction of body shape evolution following deep-sea transition. Towards this goal, a new phylogeny of the anglerfishes (Lophiiformes) will be constructed with unprecedented taxonomic sampling. This project will primarily utilize specimens and tissues housed at the Burke Museum at the University of Washington, as well as scanning technology housed at Friday Harbor Laboratories.

There are generally two ways that organisms can acclimate to a changing climate: Non-genetic changes and genetic changes. Genetic changes are passed down across generations, allowing offspring to be more successful in the future.  This research will use preserved seed collections, together with natural populations that have descended from these same ancestors, to create an 'evolutionary time machine'.  By resurrecting seeds of dormant plant ancestors, and growing them together with their offspring under common conditions, this research will expose evolution in action.  Determining whether adaptation can keep pace with a rapidly changing climate has major implications for predicting the future of biodiversity, and the fate of individual populations and species.  This work will advance a basic understanding of adaptation, and will also inform management decisions, promoting ecosystem health and preserving biodiversity.<br/><br/>In investigating adaptation we are often limited to the endpoints of past processes, however resurrection experiments allow us to leverage preserved propagules to quantify evolutionary change across time.  The fellow will resurrect dormant seeds of Plantago patagonica, a widespread annual plant, from herbarium collections, and will compare them to contemporary genotypes collected from the same locations in a series of common gardens.  By replicating resurrections across an environmental gradient in northern Arizona, this work will simulate future drying and warming, and will assess how patterns of local adaptation might constrain adaptive potential.  This framework facilitates an understanding of the role of gene by environment interactions, and provides a framework for predicting future responses to climate change.  This work expands past resurrection implementations by growing ancestors and descendants in natural field environments, across a gradient of abiotic conditions, and by combining experimental data on phenotypic responses with genetic data documenting the demographic implications of selection.  In addition to its contributions to basic science, this work will promote a better understanding of evolutionary biology in the local community through collaborations with a non-profit STEM center.  The fellow will also lead undergraduates and members of the community in collecting seeds for a seed bank repository associated with the Southwest Experimental Garden Array; this effort will foster an appreciation for local plant biodiversity, and will amass seed resources from across a remarkable environmental gradient in northern Arizona to be used for future local adaptation and resurrection experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of science outreach dates back to the beginning of modern science research, but in more recent times, science outreach is increasingly seen as a necessary component of the scientific enterprise, particularly in the context of promoting access, equity, and inclusivity. Yet, challenges exist with regard to scaling and sustaining science outreach efforts. As the field of science outreach moves towards professionalization, it is important to understand how science outreach programs and activities are currently viewed among members of the scientific community. The goal of this project is uncover how science outreach is valued among scientific researchers, learn what motivates scientists to participate in science outreach related initiatives, and examine how gender and race influences participation. The results of this project have the potential to raise awareness about the importance of science outreach and ultimately support increased, effective, and sustainable public engagement with science. <br/><br/>The aims of this project will be accomplished through the creation, dissemination, and analysis of a nationwide survey instrument which will be developed with collaborative input from representative members of the growing national science outreach community. The survey instrument will be tailored to query three distinct groups of respondents that exist within the scientific community: 1) Respondents who do not conduct science outreach; 2) Respondents who participate in science outreach with varying frequency; 3) Respondents who practice science outreach as their profession. A large-scale survey will be conducted and the responses will be analyzed and shared with the broad scientific community through peer-reviewed publication, alongside complementary write-ups and future recommendations, which will be shared on free and publicly accessible web platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is an important process, but no complete framework exists to predict particle formation and growth rates.  In particular, the role of water in these processes is unknown, because it is difficult to detect its presence and structure in new particles.  This project focuses on isolating ""seed"" particles with precisely known composition and growing them in inside a mass spectrometer under precisely controlled conditions. This allows the exact changes in composition to be followed one molecule at a time.  Water vapor pressure is controlled to determine whether it speeds up growth. Molecular clusters containing water are analyzed to determine the cause of the rate increase.  This work establishes how water impacts particle formation and provides critical comparisons for theoretical efforts to predict particle formation rates.  This will ultimately help to reduce uncertainties in global climate models. The project provides training and research opportunities for graduate students.  In addition, Professor Johnson and his students engage in outreach to the broader public through demonstrations and visualizations of particles forming clouds. <br/><br/>This project directly addresses the mechanistic impacts of water on new particle formation.  Using variable-temperature ion trap mass spectrometry techniques, the kinetics and energetics of growth are determined for precisely specified seed clusters consisting of sulfuric acid and a set of organic acids and amine bases, in the presence or absence of water.  Three hypotheses are being tested: (1) Water serves as a ""sacrificial ligand"" that enhances the sticking of incoming vapors.  (2) Water stabilizes surface-bound molecules through cooperative hydrogen bonding.  (3) Water catalyzes growth by lowering the barrier to structural rearrangement of the existing cluster to accommodate incoming vapors.  The critical structural features of seed and product clusters are characterized by in situ vibrational spectroscopy to determine the most active sites for growth.  This work is carried out in collaboration with theoreticians modeling particle growth. The experiments can validate the theoretical approaches and the calculations provide additional insights into experimental results.  This project is expected to yield enhanced predictions of growth rates, explicitly including water, that can be adapted to regional climate models. In addition to providing training and research opportunities to students, Professor Johnson also plans to interact with the Alan Alda Center at Stonybrook on promoting science communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Rapid human alteration of global processes and the degradation of ecosystems worldwide have led to a sixth mass-extinction event. To counteract these outcomes, botanical gardens and arboreta are leading the charge in the conservation and reintroduction of threatened and endangered plant species. Achieving these goals is challenging and determining how reintroduction outcomes are influenced by responses of threatened and endangered plants to environmental conditions at reintroduction sites could greatly improve conservation practice. However, there is still lack a basic understanding of the characteristics of threatened and endangered plants necessary to undertake these efforts. To address this, the fellow will focus on using the wealth of information on threatened and endangered plant species contained in living botanical collections to understand plant reintroduction outcomes, a novel use of these underutilized resources. To connect with the broader community the fellow will mentor undergraduate students underrepresented in the biological sciences and develop an education module on threatened and endangered plant conservation for K-12 students and the general public. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to determine the effects of environmental filtering on tropical threatened and endangered woody plant reintroductions. Many studies have focused on the importance of environmental filters in structuring plant communities, but most are limited in their ability to do so directly because they do not exclude competition. The fellow will use Hawaiian threatened and endangered reintroductions, where competition is excluded, as a model system to test the effects of environmental filtering on plant performance. Using this approach, and data from living threatened and endangered plant collections, the fellow will address the following questions: (Q1) How do the range of functional strategies possessed by Hawaiian threatened and endangered plant species differ from common invasive species? (Q2) What factors underlie threatened and endangered plant reintroduction outcomes? (Q3) How can trait multidimensionality inform the design of effective threatened and endangered plant reintroductions? This project will lead to a more thorough understanding of how species' trait syndromes mediate performance along abiotic gradients, while improving threatened and endangered plant reintroductions worldwide. These activities will significantly expand the fellow's expertise by providing training in the use of modeling approaches to determine how trait multidimensionality drives community assembly. Additionally, the fellow will develop a hands-on training workshop for undergraduate and graduate students focused on integrating plant functional traits into restoration and reintroduction projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to affect over 1,000 undergraduate students each year at the Rochester Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>The teaching platform developed by this project will analyze student program submissions to create program dependence graphs that combine control and data flows for Java and Python programs. The graphs will be used to cluster similar student submissions using graph alignment, and to detect semantic expected code patterns using subgraph mining. The goal of the platform is to promote improved teaching effectiveness by presenting analytics that will help instructors understand the performance of individual students and classes as a whole. It is also designed to suggest avenues for further discussion with the class. The technical evaluation of the project will study how well the platform identifies clusters and patterns in both synthetic and real assignments. Instructors from Rochester Institute of Technology, several neighboring universities, and local high schools will participate in training workshops, and the platform will be used in introductory courses at Rochester Institute of Technology. An additional goal of the project is to develop knowledge bases to enable the use of the teaching platform with new assignments, and to evaluate the impact of the platform on the instructors' grading and teaching style. The teaching platform targets instructors of computer science courses and has the potential to influence any student studying computer science.

However, mobile application programming is challenging. Software developers need to consider user interactions, changes in the conditions in which the mobile application is running, and carefully monitor resources on the mobile device.  As a result, many mobile applications have software errors (bugs) that waste energy and cause the battery to be discharged quickly. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive solution to reduce energy waste caused by software bugs and enable application developers to create energy-efficient apps.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project studies how real-world applications with energy bugs behave by collecting their runtime information and characterizing the energy misbehavior.  This project then explores a utilitarian mobile operating system design with a new abstraction lease, to manage mobile resources efficiently even when applications have energy bugs. To facilitate application developers to leverage the new operating system design, this project further designs new interfaces for developers to define custom utility, a library to perform online optimization on utility and energy efficiency at application runtime, and an energy profiler to optimize low-utility code.<br/><br/>Mobile applications today provide services integral to our daily life. Building energy-aware applications is ever more important. This project can effectively improve our understanding of application runtime behavior, significantly reduce the impact of potential energy bugs, and help application developers more easily build energy-efficient applications. This project will also promote teaching, outreach, and training by exposing students to the real-world challenges and design principles in building energy-aware applications.<br/><br/>The project outcomes include paper publications, technical reports, presentations, course material, datasets, and software. The outcomes will be made available for download at https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang and be maintained for at least five years beyond the completion of the project.

Effective communication of scientific concepts is limited by the fact that good diagrams remain hard to create: abstract logical or mathematical concepts are difficult for non-experts to translate into compelling graphical figures, and traditional software tools produce static diagrams that do not easily facilitate interaction or exploration.  This project develops a next-generation framework called Penrose, where high-quality diagrams can be created by simply typing expressions in domain-specific languages that reflect the way students and scientists already talk about mathematics.  The project's novelties are to systematically encode the relationships between abstract mathematical statements and their visual representations, and to automatically generate diagrams satisfying these relationships via constrained nonlinear optimization.  The project's impacts are to significantly lower the barrier to creating effective diagrams, and to accelerate the rate at which complex technical ideas are communicated---especially in the domain of scientific education and research.<br/><br/>The project takes an interdisciplinary approach between programming languages and computer graphics.  At the language level, Penrose enforces a clean separation between mathematical content and its visual representation via two extensible specification languages, Substance and Style, akin to HTML and CSS. On the graphics side, programs are compiled into a constrained optimization program whose solutions describe a family of possible diagrams.

The focus for this workshop is data structure, data acquisition and validation, and the prerequisite is data analytics for various wellbeing constructs. Built upon the strengths of existing research networks, especially in development of Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI), the participants will harness the data revolution to support data sharing, interoperability, modeling, analysis, and visualization for wellbeing-centric sustainable built environment. The workshop targets to provide a forum to lay the foundation for future international collaboration in the theme areas identified. <br/><br/>Anticipated collaboration among researchers from the U.S. and European researchers will enrich access to rich datasets for comparability and case studies and obtain raw materials with which to develop novel proposals on data infrastructures. By using comparative data and case studies, the participants will begin to draw inferences on common model features as well as divergent model features, especially in the area of human behavior. Data derived from comparative local environments will be instructive for building future scenarios comparing unit-to-community level integration. Those platforms should also help to enable various solutions to bottleneck problems that hinder wider research collaborations and development of data- driven decision tools. Through this workshop the engagement of U.S. researchers with similar researchers and stakeholders (scientists, engineers, industrialists, healthcare professionals, etc.) from Europe will begin a dialogue that enable U.S. researchers, and ultimately U.S. industry, to develop multidisciplinary validation and verification models to assist U.S. market and policy decisions from data derived by comparative studies.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that climate variation is driving changes in high-elevation ecosystems. The study combines insights from 29 years of existing data with new field observations and experiments to understand how extreme weather and environmental variables such as warming temperatures and reduced snowpack affect salamanders in a rapidly changing mountain environment. In addition to being broadly applicable to other amphibians, this research will inform conservation approaches for many other species in rapidly changing high-mountain ecosystems and other ecosystems experiencing climate variation. Amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrate animals on the planet, and high-mountain environments are undergoing dramatic ecological changes in response to climate variation. There is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of species responses to climate variation to design effective conservation measures for particular environmental contexts. The fellow will involve undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in biology in the project and develop teaching tools that prepare students from diverse backgrounds to pursue and fund graduate research.<br/><br/>First, the fellow will explore the effects of past climatic variation on phenology (e.g., timing of reproduction and hibernation) and life history (e.g., body condition, survival, fecundity, longevity, etc.) using long-term demographic data. Sophisticated statistical models will be used to evaluate relationships and links between population dynamics in salamanders that have polyphenic adult morphs (aquatic and terrestrial) that live in the same location but are subject to climate variation under different environmental contexts. Second, this research will compare temperature and water stress impacts of climate trends, which are crucial physiological considerations for amphibians, under different environmental contexts (using data-logger-implanted salamanders as mobile temperature sensors) and under conditions of accelerated snowmelt (by combining biophysical salamander models and experimental manipulation of snowmelt date). Results from this research will inform how asymmetric life history impacts of climate variation under different environmental contexts can promote or hinder population resilience to a changing climate and provide a case study of how other species might respond. The fellow will participate in career development activities such as advanced statistical training, proposal writing, and teaching. The fellow will develop and teach an undergraduate equity course, initiate a diversity journal club, and create a database of annotated examples of research by biological science practitioners from under-represented groups that will be used in undergraduate courses and disseminated online.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of large datasets has evolved into complex artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years. This is because the need has expanded from just a human analyzing the data to enabling a machine to make sense of it on its own. The overarching goal of this project is to enable such AI applications - specifically, deep learning - to become more efficient.<br/><br/>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are often used in AI applications like those mentioned above.  This project addresses the fundamental limitations in resource management in modern GPUs. To this end, this project plans to take a holistic approach with three broad focus areas: (1) fine-grained sharing of individual GPUs; (2) coarse-grained sharing of a GPU cluster; and (3) dynamic readjustments to mitigate the impact of communication on distributed deep learning. The core techniques include temporal scheduling and spatial resource allocation with partial or no knowledge of job durations or workload characteristics. Algorithms designed as part of this project will have applications beyond simply running AI applications on GPU clusters. <br/><br/>Increasing GPU efficiency will help reduce the cost of using AI, leading to pervasive use of deep learning techniques. This will enable new applications of AI in emerging domains such as augmented/virtual reality and real-time interactive video analytics, while making them more cost-effective. The project includes plans to work with industry to translate the research into practice and to include its outcomes in graduate/undergraduate curricula. Lastly, it will build upon already-established outreach activities at the University of Michigan to help better convey the impact of AI on society to diverse student population groups and the general public. <br/><br/>All code and data generated and collected for this project, including software systems, simulators, and emulators, will be made available to the public as open-source resources at https://github.com/symbioticlab.

This research specifically looks at the watersheds of Hilo, Hawai'i and the role these have on coral survival in the bay. It is known that corals are affected by land runoff after heavy rains, but very little research has been done to investigate the mechanisms behind coral death. Coral survival depends greatly on the bacteria and molecules found in their surface mucus. The fellow will investigate how coral mucus changes in response to heavy rainfall. This project is important for demonstrating the interdependent relationship between land and ocean ecosystems. This project will broaden participation in biology by targeting Native Hawaiian youth. Native Hawaiians are one of the most underrepresented demographics in biology despite belonging to a culture that is rooted in scientific observation. <br/><br/>The fellow will test the hypothesis that stable microbial and molecular communities will be temporarily disrupted during heavy rain events. Mucus collected from the most abundant coral species will be monitored over three heavy rain events.

Additionally, the fellow will expand research training in microbiome and metabolomic analysis while developing new methods in 3D underwater photogrammetry. The fellow will present the findings of this research throughout the duration of the project at the University of Hawai'i at Hilo's Keaholoa student center. The findings will also be shared throughout the local high schools in Hilo.

Metals such as iron, copper and gold are among the most important natural resources used by society as they are embedded throughout our built environment. Iron is used to make steel. Copper is used to generate electricity, and copper and gold are used to move electrical current through all electronic products including smart phones, computers, televisions, electric vehicles, airplanes and all medical devices. Two of the most important sources of iron, copper, and gold are mineral deposits known as iron oxide-copper-gold and iron oxide-apatite deposits. Geologists do not yet fully understand the genesis of these mineral deposit types. The lack of a genetic model limits our ability to find new deposits that are necessary to satisfy growing demand for these metals. In this study, we will investigate the formation of both deposit types in Chile and use the results to improve our understanding of a general recipe that can be used to predict the location of undiscovered deposits. The project involves underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Michigan and Juniata College and will build new collaborations with the mining industry and academic partners in Chile. The science team will also participate in educational capacity building in West Africa each year. <br/><br/><br/>Iron oxide - copper -gold (IOCG) and iron oxide - apatite (IOA) deposits are two of the most controversial ore deposit types in economic geology. Despite having been mined for at least hundreds of years, there is no consensus for how the deposits formed. Despite clear time-space relationships among IOCG and IOA deposits in many districts worldwide, there is no consensus that the deposit types are genetically related. Despite clear time-space relationships with igneous activity, there is no consensus that either deposit type is genetically linked to silicate magma. There is consensus that IOCG deposits formed by purely hydrothermal processes, but the source of the ore fluid(s) is debated. There is no consensus for the formation of IOA deposits, with two very different genetic models proposed: 1) liquid immiscibility, a purely igneous process; and 2) a hydrothermal model that invokes basinal or magmatic brines. The most controversy centers on whether or not the two deposit types are genetically related, wherein a continuum is hypothesized to exist from shallow-level S-Cu-Au-Fe-rich IOCG mineralization that transitions to deeper S-Cu-Au-poor, Fe-rich IOA mineralization. In this study, we will investigate mineralization in the world-class Candelaria IOCG deposit and surrounding Punta del Cobre district in the Chilean iron belt where access to deep (>1,000m) exploration drill core will allow us to test the hypothesis that these seemingly separate ore deposit types evolve from the same mineralizing fluid. This project has the potential to significantly change our understanding of IOCG and IOA deposits and has transformative implications for exploration strategies for these deposit types, which are increasingly important strategic sources of their namesake metals as well as rare earth elements (REE), U, P, V, Ag, Co, Bi and Nb, all of which make our built environment - education, medicine, transportation - possible.

It explores novel communication tools for promoting those behaviors in the hard-to-reach demographic: 18-29 year-olds. Insights gleaned from the project will help shape communication strategies to solve the urgent societal problem of disaster risk reduction. The study location in the Portland, Oregon Metropolitan Area anticipates a potentially devastating earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone. Digital media developed as research tools in this project will be released as outreach products, contributing directly to national welfare via resilience-building in the Pacific Northwest. Collaborations with local emergency managers ensure that communication tools developed for this project promote essential priorities and that research findings are delivered to the agencies that will benefit most from them. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve earthquake disaster preparedness, which will save lives, economic losses, and reduce panic, anger and confusion during a future event.<br/><br/> <br/>This project addresses key gaps in current understandings of how social cognitive perspectives apply to disaster preparedness. Specific research objectives are to: 1) characterize the effectiveness of interactive environments for promoting multiple solution pathways and problem-solving related to earthquake preparedness; 2) evaluate the relevance of different approaches to observational learning related to earthquake preparedness; 3) quantify the effects of cooperation on confidence in and inclination to take preparedness action; and 4) assess the effects of social processing through digital networks on behavior adoption inclination and critical awareness. These objectives will be accomplished through four experiments using interactive digital media, supported by focus groups that ensure salience of the media to target audiences and add depth to experimental result interpretation. Pathways linking experimental variables, possible mediating variables, and key dependent variables including self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intent to act, and preparedness action will be elucidated via structural equation modeling. Extending the study of social influences on preparedness behavior into the digital arena is an innovation that resonates with the media consumption habits of the target audience. While most applications of social cognitive theory to the disaster preparedness context are cross-sectional studies, use of interactive digital environments permits an experimental approach with which to test and extend current understandings. The project also directly engages dozens of undergraduates in the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grubbs and Surita R. Bhatia of the Department of Chemistry at Stony Brook University are developing new synthetic routes for the construction of sustainable and biodegradable polymer-based materials.  Polymers or plastics consisting of many repeating units linked with carbon-carbon bonds have benefited our society in many different ways.  Due to its light weight, durability and ability to conform to shape, plastic has helped aerospace technologies take giant steps forward over the past 50 years, including advancements in satellites, shuttles, aircraft, and missiles.  In addition, the building and construction, electronics, packaging, and transportation industries have all benefited greatly from plastic materials.  While chemists have created numerous ways to assemble carbon-carbon  units into polymers, methodologies to disassemble them one-by-one are still very rare.  This reverse process is crucial because it leads to polymer recyclability, therefore providing a green life-cycle for plastics that would otherwise accumulate in the environment.  This project addresses the molecular recycling of polymers by providing new synthetic routes for the preparation of polymeric materials with programmable degradability.  New classes of polymers that result from this work are expected to retain the physical properties of current plastics but with the added benefit of being recyclable.  This work provides training and education to undergraduate and graduate students in synthetic polymer chemistry, and collaborative research activities involving researchers from underrepresented groups at a historically Black university (Prairie View University). <br/><br/>This research is focused on the design and synthesis of polymers modeled on existing acrylate and methacrylate backbones with the potential for similar physical and responsive properties but with programmable degradability.  The research activities focus on the systematic investigation of the effects of initiators (alcohols and hydroxyl-terminated polymers), catalysts (triethylamines and other organic bases), and monomer structure (glyoxylate and glyoxamide monomers) on the control of the polymerization process.  The incorporation of these different polyacetal and polythioacetal blocks with other polymer blocks into block copolymers is also investigated.  The research is innovative and focuses on the properties and degradation of a class of polymers with high potential for industrial importance.  The synthesized polymers are expected to have tunable thermoresponsivity, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and to be susceptible to photoinduced cleavage/degradation by acid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of plate tectonics, Alaska continues to move relative to the stable parts of North America. Active seismicity is found across most of the state which generates hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and potential tsunamis in coastal areas. Alaska has been built by a wide variety of geological processes. This makes it an ideal natural laboratory. Its active southern margin is particularly complex. There, the Yakutat microplate collides with the North American plate; a result of the under-thrusting of the Pacific Plate in the Aleutian subduction zone. The recent deployment of numerous seismometers across Alaska provides an unprecedented opportunity to image the underlying geological structures. Here, the team develops new tools and models in 3D the seismic velocities in the crust and uppermost mantle to a depth of 120-150 km. A series of models are generated from the seismic data. They include an isotropic component which details the geometry, temperature and composition of the subsurface structures. The models also account for directional variations in seismic wave propagation; this provides information about past and on-going deformation processes. Outcomes of the project will improve the understanding of seismogenic processes in Alaska, including megathrust earthquakes that endanger the population centers. The project also provides partial support and training in cutting-edge seismology to  several graduate students. The team will share the developed codes and analyses with the scientific community, allowing their application to other regions of the World.<br/><br/>Here, the team measures the Rayleigh and Love wave velocities derived from ambient noise and earthquakes, accounting for their azimuthally dependence. The researchers use complementary data such as receiver functions. This helps produce more refined, higher resolution lithospheric models. Novelties include the application of three-station interferometry and the inversion for the tilted elastic tensor. All data are interpreted within the framework of a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion. A distribution of accepted models is generated from which model uncertainties are estimated. Scientific objectives include (1) imaging the under-thrusting lithosphere along Alaska's southern margin as well as the overlying crust and mantle wedge; the goal is to search for slab tears, flat slab regions, slab edges, and thickened lithosphere. The team investigates as well (2) how crustal thickness differs beneath the Alaska and Brooks ranges and to what extent these and other ranges are compensated isostatically. They look for evidence of (3) anisotropy from corner flow around the edges of subducting lithosphere and (4) whether Yakutat lithosphere differs from that of the surrounding regions.  One goal is also to (5) determine the geometry of contact between cratonic and deformed lithosphere. The seismological models will be archived and shared with the broader geoscience community via the IRIS-DMS. 3-D models and other higher-level data products are delivered to the public through dynamically updated, open access databases at University of Colorado, Boulder (transitioning to GitHub). These include dispersion maps, receiver functions, surface wave observables like H/V ratios, and research codes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chattanooga is internationally recognized as one of the most innovative smart US cities, partly because of the contributions of UTC and Chattanooga's locally owned electric distribution and communication provider, Electric Power Board, which has deployed 10Gbps Internet service to over 180,000 households and businesses, allowing for more effective transportation systems; improved energy efficiency; and smart urban development. The project is novel in leveraging several select Hamilton County career-themed Future Ready Institutes (FRIs) to provide authentic research experiences in smart city development for 30 high school STEM educators (10/year) who teach in these FRIs. For 6 weeks each summer, participants work with research mentors from varied disciplines who are conducting smart-cities focused projects: electric vehicle charging, green motors, drones, land use management, power consumption, and pavement design. Smart city innovations have a significant impact on infrastructure, transportation, manufacturing, and the health of their communities. Participants will work with the STEM standards that are exemplified in the engineering fundamentals underlying their research experiences and embed them into the design of Project-Based Learning (PBL) modules allowing students to look into potential careers as engineers and the impact they could make on their city and region. The project's delivery and derived benefits in the promotion of science and feeding the pipeline of qualified and diverse future engineers and scientists are enhanced through industry partnerships, involvement of student organizations including chapters of the Society of Women in Engineering (SWE) and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and dissemination of findings to a wider audience via the web, publications and symposiums participation.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project include: (1) Increase high school teachers' research skills and practical knowledge of engineering principles related to smart city design and development. (2) Provide teachers with relevant skills and knowledge on Project-Based Learning (PBL) design and implementation. (3) Create a pipeline that will result in increased numbers of well-prepared high school students that will potentially feed into STEM related college disciplines. (4) Broaden underrepresented groups' STEM participation in underlying disciplines related to smart cities. RET participants will develop 9-week PBL modules that will be designed based on the Buck Institute for Education's seven PBL design principles for instructors. Professional development will provide opportunities for teachers to attend conferences and training sessions focused on STEM education best practices, national standards, PBL, and engineering design/critical thinking instruction. During the academic year, the project team will visit the classroom in order to provide feedback and support for implementation. The PBL curriculum modules developed by participants will focus on incorporating their research experience with their respective FRI theme and grade-level STEM concepts to meet the high school standards associated with their courses. These PBL modules will demonstrate for students the real work of engineers while educating them on the STEM fundamentals required to succeed in their current coursework. Through ongoing professional development that takes place across the entire FRI system, each FRI teacher will have the opportunity to learn from teacher participants and be a part of the curriculum's dissemination. Increased participation with local and regional industry will allow the FRIs to further leverage these partnerships, allowing for more on-campus visits, virtual discussions, and in-class experiences for students. The RET Site will also foster and strengthen a long-term partnership between UTC, Hamilton County Schools, and industry partners and has a specific target on reaching underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Snapping shrimp form mutualistic relationships with a diversity of partners such as corals and fish and are emerging as a model group for understanding symbiosis and species diversification in marine environments. However, such studies require a more complete understanding of how many different species of Alpheus exist worldwide, and the relationships among these species. This research will address these questions by building an evolutionary tree of the group with next-generation DNA sequencing data. These data will be used to test whether factors such as host symbioses or color patterns drove the spectacular diversification of this group. Studying the biodiversity of this group will help to understand more broadly the origins and maintenance of biodiversity in shallow marine tropical ecosystems. Species pages will be created through the Encyclopedia of Life for public outreach and educational purposes, and a partnership with a science museum will develop workshops in science communication for undergraduates. A graduate student, and multiple undergraduates will also be trained in genetic barcoding, species delimitation, species descriptions, and comparative evolutionary analyses.  <br/>	<br/>This research will produce the first comprehensive global phylogeny of snapping shrimp in the genus Alpheus, spanning >50% of the 300+ described species and using phylogenomic data generated via anchored hybrid enrichment. This phylogeny will be used to test long-standing taxonomic and morphological questions in Alpheus, such as the monophyly of morphologically defined species groups and the role of habitat use in driving instances of morphological convergence. A comprehensive genetic barcoding survey of field and museum specimens will help estimate the existing worldwide biodiversity of the group. Using phylogenetic reconstructions, fieldwork, and color pattern analyses, researchers will test whether color patterns - long hypothesized to have systematic importance - are important factors in establishing species boundaries. Finally, the phylogenomic tree and data on worldwide patterns of species diversity will be used to test whether species diversification in Alpheus is linked to ecological factors such as symbiosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metals such as iron, copper and gold are among the most important natural resources used by society as they are embedded throughout our built environment. Iron is used to make steel. Copper is used to generate electricity, and copper and gold are used to move electrical current through all electronic products including smart phones, computers, televisions, electric vehicles, airplanes and all medical devices. Two of the most important sources of iron, copper, and gold are mineral deposits known as iron oxide-copper-gold and iron oxide-apatite deposits. Geologists do not yet fully understand the genesis of these mineral deposit types. The lack of a genetic model limits our ability to find new deposits that are necessary to satisfy growing demand for these metals. In this study, we will investigate the formation of both deposit types in Chile and use the results to improve our understanding of a general recipe that can be used to predict the location of undiscovered deposits. The project involves underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Michigan and Juniata College and will build new collaborations with the mining industry and academic partners in Chile. The science team will also participate in educational capacity building in West Africa each year.<br/> <br/> <br/>Iron oxide - copper -gold (IOCG) and iron oxide - apatite (IOA) deposits are two of the most controversial ore deposit types in economic geology. Despite having been mined for at least hundreds of years, there is no consensus for how the deposits formed. Despite clear time-space relationships among IOCG and IOA deposits in many districts worldwide, there is no consensus that the deposit types are genetically related. Despite clear time-space relationships with igneous activity, there is no consensus that either deposit type is genetically linked to silicate magma. There is consensus that IOCG deposits formed by purely hydrothermal processes, but the source of the ore fluid(s) is debated. There is no consensus for the formation of IOA deposits, with two very different genetic models proposed: 1) liquid immiscibility, a purely igneous process; and 2) a hydrothermal model that invokes basinal or magmatic brines. The most controversy centers on whether or not the two deposit types are genetically related, wherein a continuum is hypothesized to exist from shallow-level S-Cu-Au-Fe-rich IOCG mineralization that transitions to deeper S-Cu-Au-poor, Fe-rich IOA mineralization. In this study, we will investigate mineralization in the world-class Candelaria IOCG deposit and surrounding Punta del Cobre district in the Chilean iron belt where access to deep (>1,000m) exploration drill core will allow us to test the hypothesis that these seemingly separate ore deposit types evolve from the same mineralizing fluid. This project has the potential to significantly change our understanding of IOCG and IOA deposits and has transformative implications for exploration strategies for these deposit types, which are increasingly important strategic sources of their namesake metals as well as rare earth elements (REE), U, P, V, Ag, Co, Bi and Nb, all of which make our built environment - education, medicine, transportation - possible.

Amino acids are one of the fundamental building-blocks of biological systems. Professor Cannon and his research team are devising new strategies for the synthesis of these building blocks that can provide useful quantities of amino acids that are not readily isolated from natural sources. Furthermore, because their three-dimensional shape or stereochemistry is critical for proper function, this research is working to control the exact arrangement of atoms in the amino acid products so that the products function properly in biological systems. Professor Cannon and his research team then apply these results to the chemical synthesis of a family of molecules known as indolizidines. The indolizidine structure is found in many biologically-active molecules.  Molecules of this type have many applications as pharmaceuticals and other biological agents. The broader impacts include new syntheses and applications of unnatural amino acids as well as the development of biologically-active nitrogen-containing molecules. This project also creates summer research fellowships for undergraduates in synthetic chemistry with an emphasis on support for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>There are many limitations to the syntheses of unnatural amino acids, especially those that are fully-substituted. Professor Cannon and his students are developing the reactions of dianionic enolates to provide ready stereoselective access to unnatural amino acid derivatives and other synthetic precursors. His research group is investigating the use of a chiral auxiliary to direct the stereochemistry of reactions of dianionic enolates. These reactions are studied experimentally as well as computationally in order to understand the elements of control provided by these auxiliaries. The goal is to provide a robust and accessible system for the synthesis of amino acids. These reactions are tested in complex settings in order to understand their limitations and inspire further reaction development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ample supply of solar energy can meet growing energy demands, but it is intermittent due to the daily rising and setting of the sun. A strategy to compensate for this solar cycling is to convert solar energy to carbon-containing fuels in a sustainable and scalable manner. Thus, solar energy would be harnessed in the form of chemical bonds. The basic science needed to drive such a restructuring of the U.S. energy industry begins with an understanding of how light is absorbed by molecules and then transformed into a chemical reaction - a process known as photochemistry. In this project, Dr. Nocera's group at Harvard University is developing an understanding of how to capture light energy by molecules and then productively direct the energy to drive useful chemical reactions. Dr. Nocera is actively engaged in outreach activities that introduce talented students to forefront problems in chemistry and science. He and his research team provide these students with a broad technical skill set so that they can address critical problems in their independent professional careers. Professor Nocera engages with the public to relate how chemistry can address challenges in energy and photochemistry through outreach activities in a variety of forums including national news, TV, radio programs, movies, and other public venues.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Nocera of Harvard University is developing a better understanding of the generation of highly energetic species that are critical to storing energy in the form of fuels.  Through the interplay of spectroscopy and synthesis, new reagents, reactions and processes are created for the generation of high energy species from stable M-X (M = metal, X = halogen atom) and M-O (O = oxygen) chemical bonds. Photoactivation of M-X bonds is driven from charge transfer excited states. Ligands are crafted that have favorable secondary coordination spheres so as to allow the halogen atom to be escorted from the primary coordination sphere upon photoactivation of the M-X bond. Mechanistic studies focus of stereoelectronic factors of the ligand design that deliver the halogen atom in high yields. The photointermediates are channeled to productive and selective C-H activation and functionalization. The research also focuses on photodriven production of M-O bonds and their subsequent activation at bimetallic centers residing in novel macrocyclic ligands. A new approach for generating reactive M-O bonds by light excitation exploits pre-coordinating oxoanions to the bimetallic center. The ability of light to drive the production of an energetic metal-oxo-metal bond opens an avenue to photo-oxidize C-H bonds. Dr. Nocera is actively engaged in outreach programs with the public to convey how chemistry can address important societal challenges. His outreach activities also focus on the recruitment of female students and students from underrepresented groups. In further support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Nocera has developed a new undergraduate curriculum in the subject of inorganic chemistry and photochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This remarkable result has led to a lot of new questions about neutrinos and their interactions. The next-generation neutrino experiments seek to understand neutrinos in greater detail and a precise understanding of neutrino-nucleus reactions is necessary to plan and interpret these experiments. These reactions are very similar to electron-nucleus reactions that the PI has investigated successfully in the past. In this project, the PI will apply the approach developed for electron-nucleus scattering to the neutrino experiments. Beside their role in answering questions about the neutrinos themselves, neutrino-nucleus reactions reactions have the potential to reveal more information about light nuclei, in particular about the strangeness content of their building blocks, protons and neutrons. The PI will refine the calculation of electron and neutrino scattering in order to identify the most promising future experiments. This project will provide theoretical support to both neutrino and electron scattering experiments performed in the US. The PI will continue to do outreach in rural northwestern Ohio and involve interested undergraduate students in this research project.<br/><br/>Electron scattering from light nuclei provides insights on the structure of the nuclear ground state. The PI and her collaborators have developed a high precision description of electron-deuteron scattering. All elements of the electron scattering reaction mechanism are necessary to describe neutrino scattering reactions on the same nuclei. There are many exciting neutrino scattering experiments that are running now or will run in the near future. In order to correctly interpret the neutrino data, a precise understanding of the nuclear physics involved is necessary. The current state of theory in the event generators used by experimental groups is fairly basic. The PI will adapt the knowledge of the electron scattering reaction mechanism to calculate the neutrino scattering. She will investigate neutral current neutrino scattering from the deuteron. The differential cross section depends on the strangeness content of the nucleons. Using a deuteron target allows one to access the information contained in the neutron. The PI will investigate the sensitivity to the three relevant parameters describing the strangeness content of the nucleon, and will discuss ways to put a theoretical error bar on these values.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will establish a sustained community of practice of teachers skilled in the VisChem Approach and a group of new teaching and research scholars with expertise in building conceptual understanding through the effective use of visualization. The project will help students move from describing phenomena to explaining their causes from a molecular-level perspectives (e.g., carbon dioxide in climate change, DNA changes in genetically modified organisms).

Three chemistry teacher cohorts (N = 64) will participate in intensive institutes to learn the research foundation and pedagogical moves for the VisChem approach. The approach uses carefully produced dynamic visualizations with teaching strategies informed by a cognitive learning model. Key to VisChem is communication of internal visualizations using storyboards (drawings with explanation) of chemical and physical changes. The project will use an iterative research design examining teacher and student learning in the institutes and how they implement the learning in classrooms.

Applications include displays, solar cells, smart phones, tablets, light emitting diodes (LEDs), as well as emerging flexible versions of these optoelectronic devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, artificial skin, and e-paper. The availability of high performance, optoelectronic devices greatly impacts technologies such as wearables, the Internet of Things, and more, thus contributing to the nation's economy and security. Currently, rigid glass substrates are typically used with an antireflection layer. However, these coatings do not provide for antireflection across a wide range of wavelengths or angles and lack other desired multi-functionality. This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program award supports research to create a framework for applying machine learning methods to nanomanufacturing processes. A specific goal is to utilize the machine learning and optimization approach to design and construct nanophotonic structures on surfaces to achieve different optical properties such as anti-fogging and anti-bacterial. Additive nanomanufacturing is a versatile method to create complex 3D structures with nano-scale features. Since many surface engineering designs and functions are possible, a machine learning approach is needed. The project studies nanomanufacturing approaches involving maskless and scalable etching and deposition processes that are commonly used in the semiconductor device fabrication industry. This research activity is highly multidisciplinary and exemplifies the unique role that industrial engineering and materials engineering play in the future of nanomanufacturing research and in training the future workforce.<br/><br/>The project creates a framework that integrates nanomanufacturing methods, such as reactive ion etching, with machine learning and optimization tools, physical simulations, and multi-functional characterizations to demonstrate durable and flexible nanostructured optoelectronic substrates with high performance photon management properties, such as antireflection and haze management. Most of the recent work in surface engineering of multi-functional nanostructure coatings for a wide variety of rigid and emerging flexible optoelectronic devices has involved traditional trial-and-error approaches that offer, at best, fragmented and limited systematic studies of small regions of the parameter space absent any embedded historical knowledge. Major challenges exist in demonstrating the scalability of manufacturing processes. This research seeks to test the hypothesis that a machine learning and optimization framework can be utilized to more rapidly design and engineer optoelectronic substrates compared to current incremental approaches. Machine learning methods are integrated to fit experimental data, predict the performance of new structures, and provide heuristics for additional experiments. Current limitations are overcome through the creation of new machine learning methods that succinctly learn nanostructure-additive NanoManufacturing-property relationships with the ability to generalize across domains. Machine learning models are developed to determine how to manufacture 3D nanostructured surfaces on glass and plastics using additive nanomanufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One type of multilingualism that is increasingly prevalent under pressures from globalization occurs in small, tight-knit communities wherein one of the languages being spoken is endangered. The importance of scientific investigations of these situations is twofold. First, little is known about the processes at play when multilingual people shift away from one of the languages. Second, the endangered language, which encapsulates important knowledge, often has been the least documented and researched. One important example of this situation is found in the Nasal speech community in southwest Sumatra, a region full of linguistic diversity and exceptionally complex multilingual situations. What is striking about this multilingual community is that the endangered language, Nasal, was not known by linguists until 2007, and to date it has not been the subject of any significant research. Yet, preliminary fieldwork reveals Nasal has unique linguistic properties, such as unique verbal affixes that present disparate meanings related to the ""completeness"" of an action. This project is an international collaboration between the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UHM), Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, and Nasal community. It will provide important training in linguistics to faculty and community members in Indonesia, and students in the US and Indonesia. It will also foster binational relationships between the US and Indonesia. The broader impacts also include the professional development of a UHM doctoral student and a public repository of recordings of speech events and their transcriptions that can be accessed by scholars from the US and Indonesia and Nasal community members. <br/><br/>This project will document the linguistic practices of the Nasal speech community, which represents an especially complex sociolinguistic situation in Bengkulu province, Indonesia. This community is multilingual where Nasal (nsy), an endangered Malayo-Polynesian isolate with little existing documentation, is used alongside South Barisan Malay (SBM; pse) and Kaur (vkk) in everyday interactions. The primary aim of this project is to document Nasal in all of its multilingual complexity. Thus, this project will produce extensive audiovisual documentation of Nasal in its multilingual context accompanied by a comprehensive grammatical description. These materials provide crucial data into the study of multilingualism in tight-knit communities, the history of western Indonesia, and the nature of unique verbal affixes in Nasal. Furthermore, as historical linguists and archeologists piece together the history of western Indonesia, additional data from Nasal has the potential to radically alter this picture. Specific activities include: (i) assemble a large audiovisual corpus of the linguistic practices of the Nasal speech community, (ii) compile a multilingual lexicon, (iii) mentor a doctoral student who will write a dissertation on Nasal, and (iv) draft a Nasal reference grammar and Kaur sketch grammar.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This project advances the study of symbiosis, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology and has broader impacts for both the general public and students from kindergarten through graduate school. Interactions among species are hugely important for generating the wealth of biodiversity seen today, yet highly specialized interactions between species are rare in nature and are thought of as evolutionary dead ends. The project details the evolutionary history of Zamia cycad plants, their symbiotic insects and the symbiotic gut bacteria of those insects.  It assesses the effects of species-interactions on evolutionary trajectories, with comparisons between mutualistic and parasitic insects and amongst insects and bacteria. This evolutionary analysis of an entire network of interacting partners is the first of its kind and will show that specialized lineages are not necessarily evolutionary dead ends and define the mechanisms of species interactions that can lead to lineage diversification. Finally, this work highlights an endangered plant lineage, defines conservation status of symbiotic insects, and describes the necessity of interactions for lineage persistence. This system is ideal to engage the general public in conservation concerns through presentations with the Atkins Center for Sustainability and popular science articles in the Cycad Society Newsletter. The project has broad applications for student engagement as well through presentations at New York high schools, home schools, and youth detention centers, and intensive workshops and laboratory mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project uses the ancient plant genus Zamia and its multiple specialized relationships to describe the evolutionary history of a species interaction network and the potential for, and mechanisms of, lineage diversification in highly specialized interactions. It will utilize DNA extractions from preserved and pinned museum collections to build phylogenetic hypotheses for the entire network of partners: plants, pollinating and herbivorous insects, and insects' symbiotic gut bacteria. The contribution of species interactions to lineage diversification in evolutionary time will be assessed using comparative evolution of morphological traits from museum collections along with non-morphological phenotypic traits from living collections. Lineage diversification in ecological time will be analyzed using population genetics of host-shifting insects in living collections. Finally, insect mechanisms of host perception that contribute to partner fidelity and partner diversification will be described using chemical ecology and insect physiology methods. The fellow will receive training in phylogenetic, population genetic, quantitative morphometric, chemical ecology and insect physiology methods at Cornell University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participant cohorts will include students with media and communication training who will document the research experience via real-time social-media platforms, and collate media materials to produce short documentaries of the IRES experience. The students will pursue Geoscience-centric research documenting the occurrence of the pipe-like structures, and apply laboratory techniques to understand their composition, physical properties and origins. The pipe-structures contain significant abundances of magnetite, an important iron-ore resource, and may also contain economically significant abundances of phosphor, vanadium titanium and rare elements such as zirconium, niobium and tantalum. The students will develop research and communication-skills in describing and analyzing these important mineral and metal resources that are critical to economic priorities in the high-tech, defense and telecommunication industries. Participants will also have opportunities to visit mining locations to learn about the extraction and processing of these strategic resources. A parallel research stream will seek to address why Study Abroad Program participation rates by Hispanic students are significantly lower compared to institutional enrollment demographics. Using student produced media, customized communication strategies that appeal to different student populations at TTU will be used to develop models for broadening participation in Study Abroad Programs. Through collaboration with South African researchers and students the program will foster exchange of knowledge, perspectives, cultural experiences and raise awareness of global-scale challenges in mineral resource exploration, exploitation and supply-chains in U.S. students. The Media & Communication products will be available to the TTU Office of International Affairs for promotion and recruitment purposes. More broadly, the materials will be used by the institution to promote the global nature of a Texas Tech education under the ?Bear our Banners Far and Wide ? Communication in a Global Environment? Quality Enhancement Plan. Participants will receive an array of value-added educational and professional development opportunities (communication skills, leadership, cultural awareness) that will promote and advance their preparation for entering the work-place.<br/><br/> Magnetite-ilmenite-apatite assemblages that are enriched in iron-titanium-phosphor (Fe-Ti-P) are found in a variety of localities worldwide. Some deposits contain uncommonly high abundances of titanium (Ti) and vanadium (V) and may be exploited for these more valuable resources, which are increasingly sought after for applications in the energy, electronics and high-technology sectors. The Bushveld Complex contains perhaps as much as 90% of the world?s proven V2O5 resources, significant proportions of which are concentrated in layers and pipe-like structures dominated by magnetite. Despite their economic potential the pipes are little studied features that have an unknown distribution, occurrence and volume, poorly constrained relationships with the larger Bushveld Complex and the few descriptions of their petrology have disagreed on their petrogenetic origin. A parallel media and communication research-stream will inform strategies for the recruitment of more diverse student cohorts to STEM and Study Abroad programs. Building participant cohorts from different disciplines will enable perceptions held by STEM and non-STEM students about other fields of study to be examined and strategies to promote inter-disciplinary awareness on complex global structures, such as the strategic-mineral industry, will be examined. The longer-term goal will be to foster familiarization with scientific research methods among participants, particularly from under-represented communities, who are considering applying to graduate programs. Inclusion of the IRES program on R?sum?s will strengthen graduate program application packages increasing their competitiveness for funded offers of admission, which is recognized to be an important consideration for under-represented and first-generation college students considering graduate school. The program will also promote success of participants in graduate research by providing a level of preparedness to counter common challenges faced with students from such cohorts (e.g. imposter syndrome, sense of belonging and place, integration into a research-intensive Department).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This research focuses on the morphology of fish skin, specifically, the microscopic scales called denticles on sharks and rays. Denticles have many proposed functions, including protection from predators, abrasion reduction, and alteration of water flow over the body. Shape characteristics of denticles are known to differ among species as well as along different positions of the body within an individual. Denticle shape is thought to alter water flow along the body of fish, by decreasing hydrodynamic drag. The functional significance of these scales is of particular interest because sharks and rays use many different ways of swimming, and there are many different denticle sizes and shapes. By comparing skin form with function, the fellow will answer questions about fish biology, including evolution, locomotion, and habitat. The Fellow will gain understanding of fish functional morphology by learning new techniques, including robotic testing of 3D printed skin. The results will also be important for learning about underwater locomotion for human use. The Fellow will  work closely with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to develop a hands-on teaching seminar for young girls interested in shark research.  <br/><br/>The fellow will use elasmobranch specimens from the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology to conduct a large-scale comparative analysis of denticle shape. The Fellow will be trained in multiple three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques to examine denticle morphology of species that employ various locomotor modes (i.e. axial-undulatory and pectoral-fin propulsors). The Fellow will use gel-based profilometry, which determines surface metrology variables (i.e. denticle roughness) together with micro-computed tomography, to create 3D models of individual denticles along various parts of an animal's body. These models will be used in a high-resolution 3D printer to produce a flexible material for quantitative hydrodynamic testing to investigate the fine-scale fluid dynamics produced by the skin denticles. Understanding how the morphology of the denticles contributes to hydrodynamic function and the ecology of elasmobranchs is important for understanding the structural and functional evolution of elasmobranchs and to design more efficient biomimetic materials for underwater locomotion for human use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. It is unknown to what degree baleen whales ingest microplastic, how ingestion occurs, and if there are any health effects. This research seeks answers to these questions. In whales, baleen acts as a sieve and retains prey during filter-feeding. The first objective uses a laboratory experiment to test baleen's effectiveness in trapping microplastics suspended in water. The fellow will also use baleen specimens to study pollutants derived from ingested plastic. In a live whale, baleen remains intact for two years to two decades, dependent on species, before it wears out and is replaced by growing outwards from the gum line. This process, which is similar to that of human fingernails or tree rings, allows baleen to serve as a record of variation in a whale's internal (body processes) and external (e.g., pollutants) conditions at the time that portion of the baleen grew. The second objective will establish methods to use baleen to track contaminant exposure over time. In addition, the fellow will mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, fostering these young scholars' first research experiences and aiding the fellow's professional development.<br/><br/>Baleen is a keratinized filtering structure unique to mysticete whales. Despite its iconic status, baleen remains enigmatic and understudied. For this work, baleen will be acquired from freshly deceased specimens that strand in California, and from collections stored at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The first aim of the fellow's research is to test baleen's efficacy in retaining microplastics suspended in the water column using a laminar flow tank at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University. In this experiment, the fellow will use baleen from species with divergent feeding styles and baleen morphologies to elucidate which mysticetes are more likely to ingest microplastics directly from the water column, and also how microplastic particle size and buoyancy influences their capture. For the fellow's second objective, baleen specimens will be analyzed using high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for contaminants that are indicative of synthetic material ingestion (e.g., phthalate plasticizers, chlorinated and brominated flame-retardants). Using the same analytical methods, the fellow will leverage the accreting property of baleen to create multi-year intraindividual chronologies that will clarify microplastic exposure in unprecedented geographic and phenological resolution. Taken together, these studies will provide a critical assessment of baleen whales as bellwethers for microplastic pollution and will release the untapped potential of baleen collections to assess overall marine ecosystem health. Furthermore, the fellow will develop outreach materials with the California Ocean Alliance, mentor undergraduates through Stanford's Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (VPUE) program, and assist high school students in their Youth Engagement through Science (YES!) internship at the Smithsonian Institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the synthetic conditions for tailoring the assembly of these materials as nanoscale films, as well as for the chemical modification of the films post-assembly are investigated and optimized.  Understanding the mechanisms of film formation is crucial for the effective fabrication of devices that harness the properties of these materials.  The ultimate goal is to develop patterning methods and structural features that are necessary for the incorporation of these surface-anchored frameworks within device architectures for practical applications, such as gas storage, chemical catalysis, chemical sensing, and energy storage.  The project engages undergraduate students and trains future scientists in science and technology at the interface of chemistry, material science, physics, and engineering in a research-rich undergraduate liberal arts setting at Furman University.  Multiple facets of this research are integrated throughout the chemistry curriculum and incorporated as course-based student research projects.<br/><br/>The project investigates the major chemical and physical mechanisms that direct the bottom-up solution-phase assembly of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) in thin films.

Artificial polymers are plastic materials consisting of many repeating molecules that are joined together by carbon-carbon bonds.  Polymers benefit our society in many different ways (e.g., light-weight, easy to manufacture, and durable) and so they have become a part of everyday life.  An important goal in the field of polymer science is to generate plastic materials that can be readily recycled - and this includes reshaping the materials during heat or pressure treatments.  This work addresses a unique class of polymers associated with boron starting materials, instead of the usual carbon-based polymers.  Boron  polymers provide excellent building blocks for construction of 'smart' materials that change their original properties when exposed to external stimuli such as light, heat, pressure or chemical compounds.  They may provide plastics that are more recyclable than current carbon-based materials.  The project contributes to the training of a diverse group of students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment.  Dr. Jaekle and his group participate in high school outreach activities and efforts at maintaining and expanding access to a polymer and nanomaterials characterization facility at Rutgers-Newark (PolyRUN).<br/><br/>The research team is preparing new organoborane polymers, studying their properties, and pursuing diverse applications.  In the first goal, polymeric Lewis acids and 'frustrated' Lewis pairs (FLPs) are developed as supported catalysts.  Tailor-made and sterically hindered, yet highly electron-deficient, triarylboranes are modified with polymerizable groups and subjected to copolymerization with monomers that feature Lewis base groups and/or substituents that facilitate polymer recovery.  The copolymers are investigated in metal-free catalysis reactions such as hydrogenation and hydrosilylation of imines, aldehydes and ketones.  The second goal of this work focuses on the preparation of polymers with less sterically hindered organoboranes as building blocks for supramolecular materials. When combined with Lewis base-functionalized polymers, these blocks reversibly form classical Lewis pairs as crosslinks of transient polymer networks.  The last goal concentrates on the mechanochromic and stimuli-responsive properties of organoborane polymers and the synthesis of B-N analogs of polystyrene (azaborine polymers).

Such nutritional symbioses occur frequently across many different organisms, including primates, plants, and insects. This research will investigate the joint evolutionary history of a highly successful and diverse group of insects, carpenter ants and their relatives, and the bacteria Blochmannia. Carpenter ants are the most diverse and abundant group of ants in the world - most kids have encountered them while playing outside. All carpenter ants carry Blochmannia bacteria inside their gut cells, making the bacterium an endosymbiont. Both organisms rely on one another to survive. Evidence indicates that carpenter ants and Blochmannia have maintained a close nutritional partnership for tens of millions of years. Obligate symbiotic associations among different kinds of organisms can profoundly impact the nature and tempo of the evolution of both partners, and microbial endosymbionts have been suggested to have played important roles in the diversification of some insect groups. This research will determine how the carpenter ants and their relatives evolved alongside Blochmannia. The findings will improve our understanding of how symbioses arise and are maintained in animals, with potential implications for the evolution of human-associated microbial systems. Moreover, the project will emphasize public education in ant biodiversity and microbial symbioses, and the training of early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This research will infer the phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeographic history of ants in the tribe Camponotini, and use this comparative framework to advance systematic and co-evolutionary studies of their endosymbiotic bacteria Blochmannia. Like other obligate endosymbionts, Blochmannia exhibits substantial genome reduction compared to free-living bacteria. Genome evolution and functional variation in Blochmannia will be evaluated across a phylogenetically representative selection of camponotine ants with contrasting morphological and ecological attributes. By jointly elucidating the ant and endosymbiont evolutionary histories, the project will address such questions as: (1) What are the major features of Blochmannia genome evolution across the Camponotini clade? (2) What processes shape rates and patterns of Blochmannia sequence evolution? (3) Is Blochmannia gene content variation associated with particular camponotine host attributes? By linking phylogenetic and trait data on the ants to functional genomic properties of the bacteria we will gain an understanding of the selective forces and constraints underlying this remarkable symbiosis. A detailed phylogeny of the camponotine ants will also create a strong foundation for much-needed monographic work on this taxonomically neglected group, and allow the development of more effective identification tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At low energies, QCD is a strongly interacting theory that cannot be solved from first principles in a pencil-and-paper calculation. The effective field theory (EFT) formulation provides a complementary framework where nuclear properties at low energy can be systematically calculated. As such, EFT calculations can provide accurate input for astrophysical models of element synthesis that cannot be obtained in direct experimental measurements. In this project, the PI and his collaborators will use numerical methods defined on a space-time lattice to calculate properties of medium-light atomic nuclei (mass number up to around 40) using EFT. The PI will use Bayesian statistics to quantitatively compare competing EFT formulations. The latter is useful in constructing an accurate and systematic theory for low energy nuclear physics. Broader impacts of the research include training of graduate students in numerical and analytical work for an academic or industry career benefiting society.<br/><br/>The current project builds on the lattice EFT pinhole algorithm that was previously introduced by the PI. This algorithm allows for the calculation of the charge and matter distribution (in the center-of-mass coordinate) in Monte Carlo simulations that is necessary to couple external electro-weak currents to atomic nuclei. The PI aims to calculate electromagnetic moments of light nuclei. The same method will be used to calculate neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering that is sensitive to the neutron matter distribution. This cross section serves as a background in dark matter search experiments.  The PI will study also low energy nuclear reactions involving halo nuclei using Bayesian statistics. Halo nuclei are characterized as weakly bound quantum systems and play an important role in element synthesis in the Big Bang and stellar burning. Bayesian analysis provides a natural framework to incorporate EFT assumptions about naturalness of sizes of couplings in parameter estimation. It also allows quantitative comparison of competing theories and aids in model selection. This project will support the science programs at planned major U.S. investments in rare isotope beam experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Autschbach group is focusing specifically on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.  NMR spectroscopy is a cousin of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology used in medical diagnostics, and utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio-frequency light to reveal the structure of molecules.  In Raman spectroscopy, light (often of visible or ultraviolet wavelengths) is scattered off molecules, and slight changes in the wavelength of the scattered light can provide clues to the vibrational motions of molecules and their overall structure. With the help of sophisticated calculations and computer simulations, the outcome of experimental measurements of these molecular properties are predicted and analyzed. This research advances our understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and measured properties of molecules, as well as our general understanding of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation and matter. Theoretical methods and software developed during this investigation are made available to the larger community of scientists. In addition, this research project provides in-depth training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities for summer internships of high-school students. The student experience is enhanced by the collaborative nature of the project: While the research in the PI's laboratory is theoretical and computational in nature, it is carried out in the context of collaborations with experimental researchers from a variety of fields including materials science and catalysis. <br/><br/>The molecular properties in question are observed in spectroscopic or optical measurements and of high practical importance to learn about the structures and functions of molecules. The theoretical support provided by the PI is crucial in order to establish and refine the underlying structure-property relationships. Specifically, the properties of interest determine the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and the optical activity of molecules. The theoretical efforts of the project focus specifically on solid-state NMR parameters, NMR relaxation phenomena, and the structural and electronic origins of natural electronic and vibrational optical activity. In addition, the influence of the chemical and physical environment on these molecular properties is explored. NMR relaxation contains a wealth of information about the dynamics and characteristic correlation times of a chemical system. The PI studies the relaxation with ab-initio (from first principles) molecular dynamics simulations, which makes it possible to investigate systems containing elements from all across the periodic table. The optical activity-related part of the project focuses on resonance-effects in Raman vibrational optical activity, that is, when the Raman laser wavelength coincides with an electronic excitation wavelength, and on circularly polarized luminescence. Calculations of solid-state NMR parameters are undertaken to learn how they may reveal the unknown structures of chemical catalysts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular it concerns work on polynomial equations and their solutions. Associated to the solutions of  a collection of polynomial equations is a mathematical object, their zeta function. This research will  investigate a deep collection  of conjectures  concerning these zeta functions, made by  Alexander Beilinson, Don Zagier and others 30-40 years ago. These investigations also have consequences for theoretical Physics.  Another aspect of the project is that it will support the training of graduate students in this area of research.<br/><br/>Any system of polynomial equations  with integral coefficients gives rise to a  function of one complex variable,  the Zeta Function Z(s). It  encodes in a very mysterious way the most important characteristics of the space of solutions.  In particular,  the special values of the zeta function Z(s) at the integral values of  s should be expressed as periods, that is integrals of certain specific type. The PI is going to study the special values of the zeta functions, relating them  to the very classical mathematical objects, going back to Euler  - the classical polylogarithm functions, which generalize the logarithm function. The technique  the PI is using came from  several  parts of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, such as the theory of motives, algebraic K-theory on one hand, and cluster varieties and their quantization on the other. The very existence of deep connections between polylogarithms and cluster varieties is surprising. It will have many applications far beyond Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory, e.g. in the investigation of Scattering Amplitudes in Theoretical Physics. The PI will continue his work on  quantum geometry of various moduli spaces and their applications in Algebraic Geometry, Mathematical Physics and Number Theory, including  the study of classical and quantum polylogarithms, special values of L-functions,  motivic Galois groups,  Quantum Hodge Field Theory, cluster structure and quantization of   moduli spaces of local systems. The main priorities of the project are the following:<br/>a) To use the  relationship between cluster varieties and polylogarithms to prove Zagier's conjecture on the  special values  of the Dedekind zeta function at least for s=5, and relate the motivic cohomology to the cohomology of the polylogarithmic motivic complexes.  <br/>b) To develop the theory of quantum multiple polylogarithms, providing a quantum deformation of the periods of the prounipotent completion of the motivic  fundamental group of the punctured projective line. <br/>c) To give a comprehensive treatment of the cluster structure of various moduli related to the moduli spaces of G-local systems on surfaces. Apply this to quantization of these moduli spaces, representation theory of quantum groups,  mirror symmetry and Mathematical Physics. <br/>d) Develop  Quantum Hodge Field Theory. Its tree level gives a Feynman integral approach to Hodge theory.

Snapping shrimp form mutualistic relationships with a diversity of partners such as corals and fish and are emerging as a model group for understanding symbiosis and species diversification in marine environments. However, such studies require a more complete understanding of how many different species of Alpheus exist worldwide, and the relationships among these species. This research will address these questions by building an evolutionary tree of the group with next-generation DNA sequencing data. These data will be used to test whether factors such as host symbioses or color patterns drove the spectacular diversification of this group. Studying the biodiversity of this group will help to understand more broadly the origins and maintenance of biodiversity in shallow marine tropical ecosystems. Species pages will be created through the Encyclopedia of Life for public outreach and educational purposes, and a partnership with a science museum will develop workshops in science communication for undergraduates. A graduate student, and multiple undergraduates will also be trained in genetic barcoding, species delimitation, species descriptions, and comparative evolutionary analyses.  <br/>	<br/>This research will produce the first comprehensive global phylogeny of snapping shrimp in the genus Alpheus, spanning >50% of the 300+ described species and using phylogenomic data generated via anchored hybrid enrichment.

A comprehensive genetic barcoding survey of field and museum specimens will help estimate the existing worldwide biodiversity of the group. Using phylogenetic reconstructions, fieldwork, and color pattern analyses, researchers will test whether color patterns - long hypothesized to have systematic importance - are important factors in establishing species boundaries.

Nevertheless, the processes responsible for driving the composition of primitive magmas generated in arc regions, which are basaltic, towards the bulk composition that characterizes Earth's continents, which are andesitic, remain intensely debated. A major difficulty in understanding these 'differentiation' processes, and how they may couple with other first-order features of convergent continental margins, is the fact that the deep roots of these magmatically-active regions are rarely exposed in the Earth's surface. However, volcanic eruptions are sometimes capable of transporting deep-sourced rock fragments - known as 'xenoliths' - to the Earth's surface, providing Earth scientists with unique glimpses of processes occurring deep within the continents that are otherwise difficult to study. <br/><br/>In the northern segment of the Andean orogen (southern Colombia), a rare eruption from a recent volcanic vent transported an extraordinary cargo of xenolith fragments sourced from the deep roots of the arc and mantle section beneath it. Therefore, this locality presents a unique opportunity to help unravel the physical and chemical processes that operate during construction of continental crust in magmatically-active regions like the Andes. This award supports two early-career Assistant Professors and a woman who is a PhD student to conduct a detailed geochemical, petrologic and geochronologic study of these unique xenoliths, and the rare eruptions that brought them to the surface. In particular, this research focuses on the 'gravitationally unstable' root of the arc, a section of crustal (i.e., chemically differentiated) rocks with densities greater than the underlying mantle, represented by lithologies such as garnet gabbros, hornblendites, and garnet-bearing pyroxenites. Mechanical removal of density-unstable roots form the base of arcs, a process known as lithospheric foundering (aka, delamination), has not only been identified as a crucial process to explain the chemistry of Earth's continents but is also thought capable of inducing rapid changes in surface elevation, such as those driving the fast Neogene uplift of the Central Andean Plateau. Because the processes taking place in the lower orogenic crust are critical for understanding the uplift history of mountains, the geochemistry of the continents, and the geophysical imaging of the deep lithosphere, results from this investigation will have important implications for our understanding of the geochemical, structural and tectonic history of Andean-type plate margins. In addition to the scientific research products that will result from this investigation, the PIs will collaborate with the Rochester Museum and Science Center (RMSC) on activities that will: 1) explain the origin and physicochemical principles of arc volcanoes to the public of Upstate NY; and 2) continue to organize campus visits for high-school participants of RMSC's 'Next Level Science' summer camps, to provide local students with a direct opportunity to experience college and learn more about upper-level STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chorus waves are a type of such radio waves that interact with relativistic particles in the radiation belts. Understanding the interactions between these waves and particles is important for predicting the changing space environment and its societal impacts. In particular, this allows us to predict space weather and prepare for impacts to national commercial and defense satellites and communications - a priority set out in the National Space Weather Action Plan. <br/><br/>This project aims to explore the origin of banded chorus waves in Earth's radiation belt by analyzing data from the Van Allen Probes and performing particle-in-cell simulations to aid in interpretation. Naturally occurring chorus waves are believed to play a key role in accelerating relativistic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt, and in precipitating ~keV (and higher) electrons to the upper atmosphere, causing diffuse aurorae and pulsating aurorae. Chorus typically occurs in two distinct frequency bands separated by a gap at half of the electron gyro-frequency. The origin of this two-band structure has been a half-century-long open scientific question. This project, by systematically surveying the chorus waves and their properties right in the source region, will explore whether the spectral gap at half the electron gyro-frequency is generated at the magnetic equator, or is formed by damping as the waves propagate to higher latitudes. The electron distributions that accompany banded chorus waves will be statistically investigated and linear growth calculations made to investigate the direct energy source of banded chorus waves. Based on typical observations of waves and particle distribution, 1-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional particle-in-cell simulations will be performed to explore the multi-stage interaction processes that could account for the banded chorus waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will study two overarching equilibrium projects set in incomplete settings, where not all risk can be captured by trading.  The projects use mathematical tools that are now within reach to describe equilibrium-based ""good"" models involving (i) the formation of interest rates, and (ii) the formation of stock prices in the presence of proportional transaction costs.

Mathematically, the analysis draws from systems of fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE), which are doubly reflective in the case of transaction costs.

For many groups of organisms, available fossils are scant or poorly described, resulting in uncertainty about when major evolutionary transitions occurred. This project will expand knowledge about the fossil record and estimate an evolutionary timeline for a large and economically important plant group, the nightshades. This family of nearly 3000 species includes many crops, such as tomato, potato, and tobacco, and yet is represented in the fossil record by only a handful of described specimens. The researchers will survey putative nightshade fossils and use morphological and statistical analyses to determine their placement in the evolutionary history of the family. In the process, the researchers will be able to estimate the timing of major evolutionary changes, such as the origin of fleshy fruits and whole genome duplications. Understanding this evolutionary history is fundamental for crop improvement, which relies on the morphological and genetic variation accumulated through diversification over millions of years. This project incorporates a range of training opportunities for early-career researchers, and the results of the research will be widely disseminated through public data repositories.<br/><br/>Divergence times across the nightshades (Solanaceae) will be estimated through three specific aims. First, the researchers will revise all fossil records from the family and score a suite of discrete and continuous characters using traditional and newly developed techniques, including variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microcomputed tomography. Second, a matching morphological dataset will be created for the roughly 1600 extant species with available molecular data from previous phylogenetic analyses. Finally, Bayesian total-evidence methods will be used to jointly estimate relationships among extant and extinct species and divergence times across the family. This integrative project will be carried out by a team of botanists, paleontologists, imaging specialists, and methods developers. In addition to estimating a robust timeline for Solanaceae, the project will expand knowledge of the plant fossil record, support training of undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher, as well as strengthen international scientific infrastructure and collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology has several real-world applications, such as studying DNA knotting, constructing new data encryption algorithms, analyzing large data sets, motion planning for robotics, and developing quantum field theories in physics, to name a few. Due to a famous theorem by Smale, topology in higher dimensions is somewhat simpler than topology in lower dimensions. Therefore, it is interesting to concentrate only on spaces up to dimension four; this sub-field is called low-dimensional topology. These low-dimensions also correspond to the spaces that we live in---we live in a three-dimensional space, and if one includes time, in a four-dimensional spacetime---making low-dimensional topology even more pertinent. In low-dimensional topology, we are specifically interested in knot theory, where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, such as knotted pieces of strings. Knot theory is a fundamentally important topic in low-dimensional topology, and it is also an integral part of many of the real-world topological applications. Knot theory studies whether a knot can be transformed into another without tearing or crossing itself (such a transformation is called an isotopy), and if not, what sort of modifications need to be made to ensure they become isotopic.  Knot invariants are mathematical objects (such as numbers or groups) associated to knots which remain unchanged during such an isotopy, and consequently, are extensively used in studying knots. The current project is focused on knot theory and will explore existing knot invariants and construct new ones.<br/><br/>This project will concentrate on two modern families of knot invariants in low-dimensional topology, knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology, which have been employed for a variety of applications ever since their discovery at the turn of the millennium. The main aim of the project is to construct new extensions, such as spatial refinements, of various versions of these existing invariants. Specifically, the project has the following four goals: construct further spatial refinements of Khovanov homology invariants and their perturbations; construct a spatial refinement of knot Floer homology using grid presentations; study group actions on Lagrangian Floer homology; and construct new combinatorial spectral sequences from Khovanov homology.

One of the frontiers of modern physics is understanding what new types of quantum phenomena can occur in systems with many interacting particles. Striking examples of such phenomena discovered in the 20th century include superfluidity, superconductivity, and the fractional quantum Hall effect, all of which entail macroscopic numbers of interacting particles entering a coherent quantum state. More recently, rapid progress in our understanding of how specific abstract properties (in technical terms, topological properties) of quantum many-particle systems influence their real physical properties has led to the discovery of new classes of materials, such as topological insulators and superconductors. The latter, in particular, have drawn interest as a potential platform for quantum computing, in which information can be stored in a way that is intrinsically robust to random noise.<br/><br/>The research focuses on two themes that are of current interest both for expanding our understanding of new types of possible quantum phenomena, and for investigating how strong interactions can potentially help identify promising platforms for quantum computing. The first theme is expanding our understanding of how topological properties can lead to new types of interacting quantum matter in three dimensions. The second theme is understanding how strong interactions, and ultimately the kinds of topological properties that are already well-understood in these systems, help shape how quantum systems evolve in time at finite temperature.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the workforce of highly trained STEM professionals both by training graduate students, and through programs and events coordinated by the PI focused on facilitating the transition of interested physics undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Minnesota to jobs in the private sector.

A combination of field-theoretic techniques and tools for analyzing group cohomology developed in the study of interacting symmetry-protected phases of matter will be used to address the following questions. First, what field theories exhibit the qualitative features of fracton phases? Second, when does symmetry in these and related systems lead to protected gapless boundary modes?  Addressing these questions will expand our understanding of how the interplay between geometry and topology in these systems leads to physical properties qualitatively unlike those of other three-dimensional quantum phases.<br/><br/>In the area of dynamics in low-dimensional systems, the focus will be on exploring the impact of constraints and topological order on dynamics. The proposed research will use a combination of numerical (exact diagonalization) and analytical approaches based in perturbation theory and random-matrix theory. As low-dimensional systems that approximate constrained systems become experimentally accessible, clarifying whether, when, and how constraints can lead to unusually slow dynamics in quantum many-body systems can significantly advance our understanding of how information can be more robustly stored at intermediate time-scales in quantum many-body systems. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the workforce of highly trained STEM professionals both by training graduate students, and through programs and events coordinated by the PI focused on facilitating the transition of interested physics undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Minnesota to jobs in the private sector.

Through inclusion of under-represented minorities, the project activities contribute to the foundation's goals to widen participation of all in science.<br/><br/>The technical work on the project is divided into two lines of inquiry. One leads to new methods for capturing wave solutions of hyperbolic systems, methods that are expected to excel on the emerging many-core architectures. Another line of inquiry leverages a new mathematical ingredient to obtain structure-preserving numerical approximations of viscous flows. The first line of inquiry is motivated by the observation that when hyperbolic solutions can be advanced in time by varying amounts at varying spatial locations, the allocation of computational resources is optimized. When this can also be done concurrently, much faster simulations are possible. New fast methods on unstructured spacetime meshes of causal spacetime tents are the projected outcome. The advances from this project benefit simulation of various wave propagation systems as well as inviscid compressible flows. Viscous incompressible flows are targeted by the second line of inquiry. Using a Sobolev space of matrix-valued functions, novel formulations are constructed that yield optimal fluid stress approximations, exact mass conservation, and pressure robustness.

Improved quantitative understanding of how this happens is essential not only for fundamental nuclear research at US experimental facilities but for progress in astrophysics, for experiments on the nature of neutrinos, and for applications to energy and homeland security. This project enables in part a new era of precision calculations of nuclear structure and reactions.  Activities include extending the range and capabilities of statistical methods for assessing theoretical uncertainties and for physics discovery, developing and testing a novel systematic approach to heavier nuclei, and improving the extraction of information from experiment that minimally depends on model assumptions. The training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in carrying out these  activities contributes directly to the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation the students and postdocs must employ is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research, which is validated by the strong track record of past members of the group. <br/><br/>Projects are in three major categories: Bayesian statistical methods for effective field theory (EFT) uncertainty quantification, EFT for finite density nuclear systems, and calculation/extraction of process-independent quantities. The Bayesian methods will be applied to inter-nucleon interactions, few- and many-body systems, and electroweak probes. They will address EFT truncation errors, parameter estimation, model selection, and model mixing. Recent studies of the density matrix expansion and phase-space contributions to many-body calculations will be the basis for further work on finite-density power counting and a renewed study of EFT for nuclear density functional theory. Finally, The PI and his collaborators will build on recent progress in understanding knock-out reactions from a renormalization group perspective, which highlights scale and scheme dependence in these interactions and raises questions about how to best analyze experiments that rely on factorization assumptions. Applications range from optical potentials to alternative treatments of short-range-correlation physics. These projects all contribute to the goal of microscopic, model-independent calculations of nuclei with quantified uncertainties. They will impact forefront problems in low-energy nuclear physics as outlined in the Long Range Plan, such as structure and reactions for the physics of nuclei far from stability, which is relevant for astrophysics and to the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase participation in groups underrepresented in biology. This fellowship will examine how shifts in coral reef biodiversity and productivity impact the natural resiliency of atoll islands to sea level rise.  Atoll reefs and islands are linked such that islands are composed entirely of sand and rubble that is derived from the nearshore reef.  Atoll reef-islands are highly significant as they provide the only habitable land in certain regions of the Pacific, and the loss of these islands is directly tied to cultural identity. It is widely recognized among indigenous and underrepresented communities that there is a need for culturally relevant applications of scientific and environmental processes. To broaden participation of Pacific Island peoples in Biology the fellow will partner with local educators in Hawaii to develop K-12 curriculum for communities with a high native Hawaiian population.  Furthermore the University of Hawaii at Hilo is a minority serving institution and provides an excellent setting for the fellow to mentor undergraduate students in all aspects of the research project.<br/><br/>This fellowship will elucidate the bio-geological linkages that enable or limit island resiliency within Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the context of future sea level rise and other environmental stressors.  Long-term photographic survey data (2012-2019) will be used for photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of nearshore coral communities.  3D reconstructions of each reef study site will be used to characterize temporal and spatial shifts in reef composition, coral health, and 3D architectural complexity. Reef community composition will be compared to atoll reef-island sediments to identify key island building species and their relative abundance on modern reefs.  Reef framework productivity (sediment rates) and erosion will be quantified from 3D reconstructions to assess sediment availability for island building and maintenance. An improved understanding of how coral reefs respond to environmental stressors will guide efforts within Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and across Pacific Island nations aimed at protecting low lying atoll islands and islanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the central notions of  the research is amenability, which relates to an averaging operation that is invariant under translation by group elements. It naturally appears in many fields of mathematics: operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, harmonic analysis. Amenability has many  applications and considerable effort has been given throughout the years to showing that various  groups are amenable.  <br/> <br/>The PI will study a newly developed property of group actions: Liouville property.  The property can be used to prove non-amenability due to the fact that if a group admits a non-Liouville action, then the group is not amenable. The PI have already developed tools for verifying Liouville property for graphs of the actions. These tools brought a connection of Liouville property of actions for strongly transitive groups and additive combinatorics. The project describes several questions on Liouville actions with streamlined approaches, as well as more ambitious problems and conjectures. In particular, the PI outlines an approach to non-amenability of Thompson group F, which is a widely open problem in the group theory. The PI provides an approach to amenability of interval exchange transformation groups.  The actions of these are Liouville, moreover, they are completely Liouville. Thus, amenability of these groups can not be approached using Liouville property. For this reason, the PI will study a property of random walk of action: growth of inverted orbits. Using this property there is a potential to determine amenability of the interval exchange transformation group. On the other hand the study of this property property leads to a more general theory that is planned to be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New data sets and new methodologies offer valuable insights, yet the emergence of habitable environments on our planet is still poorly understood. Part of the impediment to progress is due to the disciplinary nature of research. A more integrated approach that leverages the knowledge and latest achievements in each of the relevant disciplines is needed to generate new ideas and to identify new observations that distinguish between competing hypotheses. The investigators plan a summer program for the Cooperative Institute for Dynamic Earth Research (CIDER) on the theme of early Earth and the evolution of habitable environments. They seek to lower barriers to more integrated research by promoting cross-disciplinary education of researchers at all career levels. They also intend to develop a workforce that can more effectively engage in interdisciplinary research with the goal of enabling more rapid progress on an important and unsolved research problem.<br/><br/>The proposed four-week summer program brings together a cohort of senior graduate students and postdocs from institutions across the country to tackle the important question of how the early Earth developed a habitable environment. Senior participants from various US institutions, and representing a range of disciplines, will serve as instructors and mentors for group research projects. The first two weeks of the program are devoted to lectures and tutorials, covering the basic tools and approaches of the various disciplines. The second two weeks are used to develop research projects in groups with a good mix of disciplinary expertise. The outcome will be a better understanding of Earth evolution, including important questions related to the cycling of water and carbon through the Earth system, which regulates the long-term stability of climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Overall, this three-part project will help show how scales have evolved in fishes and how they function in different ways (protection, hydrodynamics, anti-parasite), thus illuminating the currently limited understanding of this important feature of fishes. In addition, this research has the potential to produce knowledge that can be useful for designing surfaces that increase hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency.

Many of these systems mix advective (or transport), diffusive, and reactive processes. We have good numerical techniques for simulating a single such process, but only a few of these can handle multiple processes at once.  This project concerns theoretical and algorithmic development of an alternate category of numerical techniques for simulation of systems of nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction equations.  These new numerical techniques show great promise, and they are likely to lead to better accuracy and computational efficiency.  Applications to geoscience problems important to energy production and environmental protection will be pursued. Assessment, design, and monitoring of human activities involving reservoirs and aquifers in the Earth's subsurface require large-scale simulation of advective, diffusive, and reactive processes over long time periods. There is a potential societal benefit in energy production and environmental protection. The project may also have an impact on broad areas of science and engineering that use models consisting of nonlinear, coupled advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The project is expected to have an impact on the STEM workforce and its diversity through the education and training of two Ph.D. graduate students (both female, one a native citizen).  Such students are in high demand in industrial and governmental labs, as well as in academia.<br/><br/>The mathematical structure of physical or biological models governed by nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations is often poorly understood, and solutions can develop shocks or very steep fronts. This project concerns theoretical and algorithmic development of high order, implicit, weighted essentially non-oscillatory (iWENO) schemes for numerical approximation of systems of such equations, because this type of scheme has the potential to handle all three processes well. The development will including finite volume and finite difference schemes, Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches, and a multi-moment variant. The objectives are to (1) develop a suitable smoothness indicator and time integrator for the problem; (2) develop a general procedure to handle possibly degenerate diffusive processes; (3) make advances on space discretization and related issues, such as handling boundary conditions and satisfying local maximum principles; (4) test the approach on applications to porous media; and (5) educate and train students in an interdisciplinary setting.  The project will lead to a very general computational framework can approximate all the necessary physics in a locally mass conservative way.  It will be simple to implement, handle general computational meshes in two and three space dimensions, be high order accurate in both space and time, maintain local mass conservation properties, be robust (i.e., unconditionally linearly stable), and maximize mesh resolution. The schemes will be efficient on high performance computers, which are memory bandwidth limited, because local information that can fit in cache memory will dominate the computations, and the global system of discrete equations will have about as small a number of degrees of freedom as possible.  The project is expected to have a broader impact on the STEM workforce and its diversity, and on the geosciences through applications of the schemes, and it may impact broad areas of science and engineering, especially those that use models of complex, coupled problems for which the mathematical structure of the application may not be well understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key difference between nanobubbles and ordinary, larger bubbles is that larger bubbles rise rapidly to the surface of a liquid and burst, while nanobubbles can remain suspended in liquids for hours or even days. Due to their unique properties, nanobubbles are extremely useful in a broad range of technological applications such as froth flotation, wastewater treatment, detergent-free cleaning, and de-inking. The key process in these applications is the coalescence of nanobubbles on the surfaces of particles, which results in the formation of particle aggregates in a liquid. The main objective of this project is to use numerical simulations and theoretical models to understand the merging dynamics of nanobubbles and the resulting capillary force between adjoining particles. The education activities related to this project will attract high school students, especially those in underrepresented groups, in the central valley (California) to the engineering program, train students to conduct research in bubble dynamics, and guide students toward doctoral research programs in STEM.<br/><br/>This project will use molecular dynamics simulations coupled with continuum-based theoretical analysis to study the effects of bubble size, surface tension, contact angle, and surface topology on merging dynamics of nanobubbles and the resulting capillary force between particles coated with nanobubbles.

Moreover, such microscopic predictions are not hindered by many assumptions and approximations used in continuum and theoretical modeling. The modeling results will enable practitioners to develop strategies for enhancing the flotation rate of fine/ultrafine mineral particles and to improve removal rates of contaminants in processes such as wastewater treatment, surface cleaning, and recycling of paper.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics and also in many physical sciences.  For example, minimal surfaces arise as minima of the the area functional and provide a mathematical model of soap films. This project focuses on a geometric functional called entropy which has drawn a lot of recent interest as a natural measure of the complexity of a surface. The main tool used to study this functional is the mean curvature flow which is a dynamic process that, roughly speaking, continuously deforms a surface in a manner that decreases its area as quickly as possible.  Mean curvature flow was first studied as a model of certain phenomena in materials science and has also found applications in computer graphics and image recognition.  Furthermore, as a geometric heat flow, it is closely related to the Ricci flow which was used by Perelman to solve the Poincare conjecture. The mean curvature flow also has promising potential applications to topology - some of which are explored by this project.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will use mean curvature flow to investigate hypersurfaces in n-dimensional Euclidean space of low entropy, that is, hypersurfaces for which a natural measure of geometric complexity, entropy, is small.

This requires the investigation of the structure of non-compact self-similar (both shrinking and expanding) solutions to the mean curvature flow.

A ""metric"" on such a space is an object that endows that space with a shape or more precisely, with Ricci curvature. The study of these metrics lies at the nexus of complex geometry and geometric analysis. This project is concerned with the construction of complete Kahler metrics with prescribed Ricci curvature on non-compact Kahler manifolds; more specifically, non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and Kahler-Ricci solitons. Applications of such manifolds permeate throughout physics and mathematics. Indeed, Calabi-Yau manifolds of complex dimension three have become prominent in string theory where they supposedly model the six additional real dimensions of space-time that we do not see, whereas Kahler-Ricci solitons provide models for the formation of singularities in an important evolution equation, namely the Kahler-Ricci flow. Efforts will be made to construct new examples of these manifolds and to formulate their existence in terms of algebraic geometric criteria. This will enhance our understanding of the geometry of non-compact Kahler manifolds and will involve applications of techniques from analysis, in particular partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the proposed research project comprises two parts. The goal of the first part is to construct more examples of non-compact complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with Euclidean volume growth and with a singular non-flat tangent cone at infinity, developing the work of Li, the PI and Rochon, and Szekelyhidi. Such manifolds have been used as building blocks for G2-manifolds and may shed light on a conjecture of Yau asserting the compactifiability of a complete Calabi-Yau manifold with finite topology. Moreover, these manifolds have applications in physics such as in the AdS/CFT correspondence and string theory.

These boundaries create unsteady, three-dimensional, and asymmetrical flows that can increase the animal's flying/swimming speed and efficiency. Despite the wide implications of these benefits, there are no reliable models for near-boundary bio-locomotion. Accurate models could reshape the way biologists think about the flight strategies of birds migrating over open water or the evolutionary pressures on the shapes of bottom-dwelling fish. A better understanding of near-boundary lifestyles could help ecologists better predict the fragility of near-ground ecosystems to over-fishing, loss of habitat, or changing climate. Better models would also reshape the way engineers design bio-inspired vehicles that operate near boundaries. The key to improving these models is a better understanding of the complex flows governing near-boundary swimming and flying. The proposed work aims to shed light on these complex flows and bring them into public view using multimedia and an outreach program for middle school girls. <br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to understand the unsteady flow mechanisms governing near-boundary swimming. The project will support the first systematic study of unsteady ground effect through a combination of water channel experiments and inviscid flow simulations. As a result, classic steady ground effect theory will be generalized to the modern interdisciplinary flow phenomena present in swimming and flying animals. These flow phenomena will be explored by testing the effects of Strouhal number, reduced frequency, aspect ratio, undulation, and asymmetric kinematics on near-ground swimming. The research will focus on four specific aims: (i) developing scaling laws for the forces and energetics of near-ground swimming, (ii) mapping near-ground three-dimensional flow interactions, (iii) determining the role of undulatory kinematics in near-ground swimming, and (iv) understanding how asymmetrical kinematics alter near-ground flows. By including both experiments and inviscid simulations, the research will identify which effects are Reynolds-number dependent and which are driven purely by inviscid vortex dynamics.

To control flow separation in this project, the flow near the surface is energized through triggering instabilities by a new lightweight, energy-efficient actuator that generates traveling waves. The main goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that this actuation is more efficient than other means and to optimize the performance of this actuator by gaining an understanding of the key parameters that govern the interaction of the actuator with the flow. This project will create a series of educational videos and the engagement of a diverse group of undergraduate students through well-established programs at our institutions. <br/><br/>The main hypothesis of this proposal is that traveling wave actuators perform better than other actuators that create standing waves because: 1) traveling waves also inject momentum (generate thrust), and 2) apart from frequency, an additional parameter (wavelength) can also be tuned to affect flow separation as demonstrated by the preliminary results. Numerical and experimental approaches will be used for flow on a typical airfoil (NACA0018). Large-eddy simulations (LES) with moving boundaries will provide possible traveling waves for the initial design of traveling wave actuators and elucidate the mechanisms of flow reattachment.

Such nutritional symbioses occur frequently across many different organisms, including primates, plants, and insects. This research will investigate the joint evolutionary history of a highly successful and diverse group of insects, carpenter ants and their relatives, and the bacteria Blochmannia. Carpenter ants are the most diverse and abundant group of ants in the world - most kids have encountered them while playing outside. All carpenter ants carry Blochmannia bacteria inside their gut cells, making the bacterium an endosymbiont. Both organisms rely on one another to survive. Evidence indicates that carpenter ants and Blochmannia have maintained a close nutritional partnership for tens of millions of years. Obligate symbiotic associations among different kinds of organisms can profoundly impact the nature and tempo of the evolution of both partners, and microbial endosymbionts have been suggested to have played important roles in the diversification of some insect groups. This research will determine how the carpenter ants and their relatives evolved alongside Blochmannia. The findings will improve our understanding of how symbioses arise and are maintained in animals, with potential implications for the evolution of human-associated microbial systems. Moreover, the project will emphasize public education in ant biodiversity and microbial symbioses, and the training of early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This research will infer the phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeographic history of ants in the tribe Camponotini, and use this comparative framework to advance systematic and co-evolutionary studies of their endosymbiotic bacteria Blochmannia. Like other obligate endosymbionts, Blochmannia exhibits substantial genome reduction compared to free-living bacteria. Genome evolution and functional variation in Blochmannia will be evaluated across a phylogenetically representative selection of camponotine ants with contrasting morphological and ecological attributes. By jointly elucidating the ant and endosymbiont evolutionary histories, the project will address such questions as: (1) What are the major features of Blochmannia genome evolution across the Camponotini clade? (2) What processes shape rates and patterns of Blochmannia sequence evolution? (3) Is Blochmannia gene content variation associated with particular camponotine host attributes? By linking phylogenetic and trait data on the ants to functional genomic properties of the bacteria we will gain an understanding of the selective forces and constraints underlying this remarkable symbiosis. A detailed phylogeny of the camponotine ants will also create a strong foundation for much-needed monographic work on this taxonomically neglected group, and allow the development of more effective identification tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates interactions of vowels and consonant voicing (such as voiced 'd' versus voiceless 't'). In English, for instance, vowels before voiced consonants (e.g. 'feed') are longer than vowels before voiceless ones (e.g. 'feet'). Despite a long research history, such interactions are still poorly understood. The empirical focus of this project is on two understudied language varieties, Franconian (spoken in parts of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands) and Low German (spoken in Northern Germany). In Franconian, vowel-consonant interactions have led to a tone contrast, comparable to Chinese languages; Low German has developed 'extra-long' vowels alongside long and short vowels, which is exceedingly rare across languages. This project will document and explain these developments, with important implications for linguistic typology and the study of cognitive underpinnings of language.<br/><br/>The project consists of an empirical, a theoretical, and a typological part. The empirical part investigates how speakers of modern dialects produce and perceive the vowels and consonants. The results form the basis for the theoretical studies. These studies aim to explicate the mechanisms at play and illuminate how understanding them furthers our knowledge of mechanisms of sound change. The typological part of the project relates the empirical and theoretical findings to comparable phenomena in other languages, which will improve our understanding of interactions between vowels and consonant voicing cross-linguistically. The combined empirical, theoretical, and typological studies will help broaden our knowledge of central issues that are at the heart of current debates in the field of phonology, viz. the structure of phonological representations, the interaction of such representations with the production and perception of phonological contrasts (phonetics), and the role of sound change in shaping phonological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has also proved useful to certain applied fields such as robotics. Moduli are parameters describing the variation in a particular geometric or algebraic structure. The construction of a moduli space brings with it a deeper understanding of which geometric structures behave well in families, and the geometric analysis of the moduli space itself reveals invariant properties of the objects they parametrize. The current project seeks to extend the PI's previous work on certain moduli spaces that arise naturally from the gauge theory of elementary particles. The Yang-Mills equations, for example, are a major point of intersection between mathematics and theoretical physics. Moduli spaces of Higgs bundles have been used to study the space of representations of surface groups into complex Lie groups and their noncompact real forms. They appear in supersymmetric gauge theories and are also important in the Geometric Langlands problem. The research projects covered by this award will further our understanding of the relationship between the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties of moduli spaces. The award also supports graduate students. <br/><br/>The specific goals lie in three areas of complex geometry related to holomorphic bundles, gauge theory, and moduli problems. The first continues work of the PI on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces. A special focus is given to understanding the asymptotic structure of the moduli space and its topological properties. This is related to important conjectures concerning the geometry of the Hitchin moduli space, in part arising from supersymmetric gauge theories. The PI will generalize previous results about the pressure metric on Hitchin components away from the Fuchsian locus. He will also explore implications for mirror symmetry calculations related to new properties of the Morse stratification of the Higgs and de Rham moduli spaces that follow from his recent work. The second project continues work on Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections on higher dimensional manifolds. One goal is to obtain a better understanding of natural gauge theoretic compactifications. The PI also seeks to extend results for projective manifolds to the Kaehler case. A related problem will study wall-crossing properties of solutions to generalized Yang-Mills equations. The third project builds on the PIs previous investigation of holomorphic extensions of analytic torsion via the approach of Deligne pairings.This will have implications for complex Chern-Simons theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence, the ability to represent the physical process is important to atmospheric, climate and hydrologic numerical models. Current representations of land-atmosphere interactions were developed based on horizontal and homogeneous terrain with various simplified modification; therefore, they cannot represent the fundamental physical processes that arise from the atmosphere's interactions with the heterogeneous and sloping terrain, characteristic of mountains. The research is to advance fundamental knowledge and representation regarding the atmosphere's interactions with mountain terrain by analyzing field data collected from two past experiments and a new field experiment specially designed for mountain terrain. Through this project, the professor who leads the research will pique student interest in mountain meteorology by developing an experiential education module and an interactive web-based slope flow simulator.<br/><br/>To addresses fundamental knowledge-gaps that limit prediction capabilities over mountain slopes, the research project will analyze field datasets to investigate how slope angle fundamentally modulates near-surface turbulent fluxes of momentum and heat over mountainous terrain. This new understanding will be used to develop new, data-driven, land-atmosphere exchange parameterizations that explicitly account for the effects of slope angle. A slope-flow layer model, coupling the one-dimensional momentum and heat balances, will be created to quantitatively evaluate the new parameterizations in comparison to the traditional, horizontal-terrain relations and to serve as the foundation for a web-based slope-flow simulator tool. In addition, since many mountain slopes are forested, the research will employ novel measurement techniques to investigate the fundamental thermo-mechanical impacts imposed by a heterogeneous forest canopy on the slope-flow-layer surface exchange fluxes and determine how they can be incorporated into the new, slope-angle-dependent turbulent flux parameterizations. The ability to parameterize surface fluxes over mountain slopes will significantly improve numerical weather forecasting, hydrologic and air quality models and remote sensing products, which are used to study environmental stressors that occur at surface-vegetation-atmosphere interfaces, threaten mountain ecosystems and have significant socio-economic implications, such as flood-drought cycles, glacier recession, vegetation stress, and wildfire hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ricci flows have become the subject of intensive study, as they have been used to prove various long-standing conjectures, such as the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures in dimension 3. The general expectation is that a Ricci flow produces a geometry in the limit that is in some sense inherent to the topology, i.e. the loose makeup, of the underlying space. However, usually a Ricci flow develops complicated singularities in finite time. In dimension 3 these singularities can be removed manually by so called surgeries and the flow can be continued beyond them. Recently, a new class of ""singular Ricci flows"" was introduced in dimension 3. These flows flow ""automatically through singularities at an infinitesimal scale"", thereby eliminating the somewhat unnatural surgery process. The goal of this project is to understand these flows further and to use this understanding to study the topology of certain spaces of metrics and diffeomorphism groups. In addition, the PI will work on Ricci flows in higher dimensions, aimed at understanding their singularity formation, which may result in a similar surgery or singular flow construction.<br/><br/><br/>The research project is split into two projects. The first project is a continuation of the PI's work (in collaboration with Bruce Kleiner) on the uniqueness and continuity of singular Ricci flows through singularities. The general goal of this project is to understand the geometric, topological and analytic applications of this work. Among other things, the PI has a strategy to resolve the Generalized Smale Conjecture, which would extend a previous partial resolution by the PI and Kleiner. Further potential applications concern the topology and geometry of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics, as well as the study of generic Ricci flows in dimension 3. The second project is a continuation of the PI's work on the study of Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature. The PI will investigate several conjectures that have been verified under the assumption of bounded scalar curvature. These conjectures are likely to remain true if this assumption is removed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key tools for distinguishing inequivalent knots are called knot invariants and these are essentially the properties of a knot that are preserved by continuous transformations of the space. In this project the PI will study the relationship between quantum knot invariants, a relatively less understood family, constructed from the ideas of quantum physics and mathematics.

Professors Ediger and Richert are studying glasses made of simple molecules to serve as model systems to answer fundamental questions about glasses. Answering these questions can have an impact on glassy materials used in technology.  In this project, glasses are prepared directly from the vapor phase.  This project investigates unusual molecular systems that have two distinct liquid states to understand how this is possible and how it might be used to produce new materials. A second goal of this project is to understand how the method of preparing a glass can impact the mobility of molecules in the glass. There are advanced technologies such as quantum computing that can benefit from decreased mobility in glass. The students involved in this project are being trained in a wide variety of chemical and physical analysis tools which are used to characterize thin glassy films. The skills and tools learned are valuable in many areas of science and technology beyond the specific molecules studied in this project. In addition, Professor Ediger and his group participate in a Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE)program at University of Wisconsin that encourages careers in science and engineering of high school students from underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>The project focuses on glasses prepared by physical vapor deposition, a process known to create glasses with unusual properties. It is likely that physical vapor deposition may serve as a shortcut to the second liquid phase of triphenyl phosphite (TPP) and other systems. AC nanocalorimetry and spectroscopic ellipsometry are used to study the stability and density of the liquids prepared by this route. X-ray scattering is used to assess the structure of the liquids. This project also seeks to understand how physical vapor deposition affects intramolecular motions in the glassy state. Dielectric spectroscopy is used to study glasses of decahydroisoquinoline (DHIQ). DHIQ displays intramolecular degrees of freedom which can alter the dipole orientation even while the molecule is trapped in a glassy solid. Measurements of DHIQ and molecules with similar intramolecular degrees of freedom provide understanding about suppression of molecular motion in vapor-deposited glasses. This project may have a broad impact on the improvement of amorphous materials used in organic electronics, since the molecules studied here serve as model systems for those materials.

Nevertheless, the processes responsible for driving the composition of primitive magmas generated in arc regions, which are basaltic, towards the bulk composition that characterizes Earth's continents, which are andesitic, remain intensely debated. A major difficulty in understanding these 'differentiation' processes, and how they may couple with other first-order features of convergent continental margins, is the fact that the deep roots of these magmatically-active regions are rarely exposed in the Earth?s surface. However, volcanic eruptions are sometimes capable of transporting deep-sourced rock fragments ?known as 'xenoliths'- to the Earth's surface, providing Earth scientists with unique glimpses of processes occurring deep within the continents that are otherwise difficult to study. <br/><br/>In the northern segment of the Andean orogen (southern Colombia), a rare eruption from a recent volcanic vent transported an extraordinary cargo of xenolith fragments sourced from the deep roots of the arc and mantle section beneath it. Therefore, this locality presents a unique opportunity to help unravel the physical and chemical processes that operate during construction of continental crust in magmatically-active regions like the Andes. This award supports two early-career Assistant Professors and a woman who is a PhD student to conduct a detailed geochemical, petrologic and geochronologic study of these unique xenoliths, and the rare eruptions that brought them to the surface. In particular, this research focuses on the 'gravitationally unstable' root of the arc, a section of crustal (i.e., chemically differentiated) rocks with densities greater than the underlying mantle, represented by lithologies such as garnet gabbros, hornblendites, and garnet-bearing pyroxenites. Mechanical removal of density-unstable roots form the base of arcs, a process known as lithospheric foundering (aka, delamination), has not only been identified as a crucial process to explain the chemistry of Earth's continents but is also thought capable of inducing rapid changes in surface elevation, such as those driving the fast Neogene uplift of the Central Andean Plateau. Because the processes taking place in the lower orogenic crust are critical for understanding the uplift history of mountains, the geochemistry of the continents, and the geophysical imaging of the deep lithosphere, results from this investigation will have important implications for our understanding of the geochemical, structural and tectonic history of Andean-type plate margins. In addition to the scientific research products that will result from this investigation, the PIs will collaborate with the Rochester Museum and Science Center (RMSC) on activities that will: 1) explain the origin and physicochemical principles of arc volcanoes to the public of Upstate NY; and 2) continue to organize campus visits for high-school participants of RMSC's 'Next Level Science' summer camps, to provide local students with a direct opportunity to experience college and learn more about upper-level STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More complicated geometric objects can be constructed by fitting these spheres together, but spheres of different dimensions can fit together in only certain combinations.  Enumerating these combinations of spheres is one of the fundamental questions of stable homotopy theory.  This problem is known as the computation of homotopy groups of spheres. The project uses spectral sequences to carry out these computations.  They are delicate, intricate, subtle, and complicated, but they are also understandable with enough insight and patience.  Each time a new part of the machinery is understood, another layer of complexities becomes accessible for further study.  Computer calculations play a large supporting role. The project promotes the use of videoconferencing to collaborate with peers, to advise graduate students, and to host online seminars.  These efforts build towards a self-sustaining virtual mathematical research community.  One major benefit of these new modes of interaction is that they erode traditional barriers to entry.  This is especially beneficial for people in remote geographical locations and for those with non-traditional or non-prestigious backgrounds who are not typically afforded access to traditional departments of mathematics.<br/><br/>The project will compute classical, C-motivic, R-motivic, and C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.  The key tools are the Adams spectral sequence, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the effective slice spectral sequence. The project consists of a series of interlocking problems, both algebraic and homotopical.  Many of the problems suggest specific methods for obtaining calculational data about stable homotopy groups.  Other problems address related structural issues, such as exotic periodicity and Mahowald invariants. A key idea is to use C-motivic calculations to see deeper into classical structure.  Preliminary results suggest that this is a surprisingly powerful technique that allows for the computation of new stable homotopy groups in a range. The project also includes a series of techniques for computing R-motivic and C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.  This represents the first serious effort to grapple with equivariant versions of tools like the Adams spectral sequence at a computational level.  The key point is to build up to the C2-equivariant computations gradually, through C-motivic and R-motivic intermediate steps.  One example of the kind of payoff for this work are computations of new values of notoriously difficult Mahowald invariants. Finally, the project will study the effective slice spectral sequence, especially in R-motivic homotopy theory but also over arbitrary fields.  This spectral sequence is a motivic replacement for the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence.  The R-motivic calculation is more accessible, while the arbitrary fields involve interesting arithmetic.  Inspired by the motivic effective slice filtration, the project will also attempt to study a new C2-equivariant filtration that ought to be useful for studying C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EHR are often messy and suffer from missing data problem for various reasons, for example more frequent clinical exams after the manifestation of the first symptoms of a certain disease and less frequent exams during routine screening. Missing data often limits the ability to extract useful information from these sources (e.g., early diagnosis). The goal of this project is to leverage the fact that missing information sometimes satisfies mathematical or physical principles to develop innovative model-based imputation approaches, combining models and efficient privacy-preserving learning techniques in large EHR datasets. Computationally efficient algorithms will be developed to train numerical models while preserving patient privacy, and the feasibility and practical usefulness of these approaches will be demonstrated at a scale that has not yet been addressed in the literature. The approaches for predictive numerical models developed for this project can be applied broadly in various fields. Additional project goals include development of infrastructure for research and education through freely available, open-source software libraries. This project will also provide invaluable multi-disciplinary skills to undergraduate and graduate students. Both research and outreach efforts focus on increasing the participation of women, people with disabilities, and of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The team will develop novel regularization approaches through numerical models, i.e., optimally trained models able to suggest distributions of missing data based on the underlying physics. For EHRs characterizing cardiovascular function, lumped parameter hemodynamic models offer an ideal regularizer. Parameter estimation for these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and therefore incompatible with fast application to large EHR collections. Additionally, optimally trained numerical models of the cardiovascular system can be thought as a type of query, rising issues of patient privacy. The proposed research tackles these issues through: (1) Acquisition and analysis of a large heart failure EHR dataset. (2) Development of privacy-preserving variational inference for hemodynamic models, enhanced using homotopy-based optimization. (3) Implementation and extensive testing of novel imputation approaches for missing data, combining uncertainty quantification and numerical models.

To control flow separation in this project, the flow near the surface is energized through triggering instabilities by a new lightweight, energy-efficient actuator that generates traveling waves. The main goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that this actuation is more efficient than other means and to optimize the performance of this actuator by gaining an understanding of the key parameters that govern the interaction of the actuator with the flow. This project will create a series of educational videos and the engagement of a diverse group of undergraduate students through well-established programs at our institutions. <br/><br/>The main hypothesis of this proposal is that traveling wave actuators perform better than other actuators that create standing waves because: 1) traveling waves also inject momentum (generate thrust), and 2) apart from frequency, an additional parameter (wavelength) can also be tuned to affect flow separation as demonstrated by the preliminary results. Numerical and experimental approaches will be used for flow on a typical airfoil (NACA0018). Large-eddy simulations (LES) with moving boundaries will provide possible traveling waves for the initial design of traveling wave actuators and elucidate the mechanisms of flow reattachment. The experiments in the wind tunnel will provide the data to validate the simulations and confirm the hypothesis by comparing the traveling against standing wave actuators. The team?s synergistic capabilities in generating traveling wave via piezoelectric actuators and the wind tunnel experiments as well as LES with moving boundaries and fluid-structure interaction uniquely position us to tackle this challenge and accomplish the tasks put forward in this proposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of such approximations is usually hard and technical and requires expertise in time and space discretization methods. For continuous problems the importance of the maximal parabolic regularity is well-recognized and has a number of applications, for example to nonlinear problems, optimal control problems and generally to problems where sharp results are required. In contrast to the continuous case, the discrete maximal parabolic regularity only recently came to the attention of the numerical analysis community and its potential is not yet fully realized. Such results, for example, reduce the analysis of transient problems to stationery ones, which are usually much less technical with many results already available in the literature. This for example would benefit a number of researchers, especially who are at the beginning of their careers and are not experts in time discretization methods.<br/><br/>In this research the principal investigator will extend the theory of discrete maximal parabolic regularity for discontinuous Galerkin time schemes in several directions. The research plan includes the following projects. The first project extends the known results to non-symmetric autonomous elliptic operators, such as transient advection-reaction-diffusion problems, including the advection-dominated case. Such problems are classical and have been at the center of research for many years. As an application of such results, the PI intends to answer some of the open questions, for example whether the stabilized methods require stabilization parameters that depend on the time steps. In the second project, the PI intends to extend our previous results for non-autonomous problems to more general norms, that are important for a number of applications, for instance, quasilinear parabolic equations and optimal control problems. Finally, the PI plans to investigate more general parabolic systems, such as transient Stokes and Navier-Stokes problems, which are very important for the fluid flow problems and to obtain fully discrete best approximation type result in general Lebesgue space norms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Occasionally, the decision maker can even face an opposing player, informed or not, leading to a so-called zero-sum game. Modeling and analysis of games is very difficult, in large part because of the potential strategic behavior of the two players. This project studies the theory behind a collection of topics in  stochastic control (one decision maker) or games (two opposing players). Some of the models are directly motivated by finance, but the general theory could be applied to  other situations. The first topic aims to  provide a better explanation of how an investor should adjust their investing strategies (proportion in each asset) in the presence of small transaction costs, compared  to not facing such costs. The second topic is a general treatment of stochastic games, with the aim to explain the difference between having an intelligent opponent (another person, acting strategically) and an uninformed one, like nature choosing a worst-case scenario for the decision maker. The third topic is of more technical nature, advancing the mathematical theory behind a peculiar kind of fees that investor can face, namely performance fees.<br/><br/>The present project aims to study three topics in stochastic control and games. The first is a study of multi-dimensional singular control problems, with the main application to approximation of optimal investment strategies with small proportional transaction costs. The goal is to deeper understand the structure of feedback optimal strategies as solutions to reflected stochastic differential equations. The second topic will  study the difference in both modeling and analysis between genuine  zero-sum games and stochastic control under  model uncertainty. While, analytically, these two situations appear to be described by the same Isaacs equation, if the Isaacs condition does not hold, allowing the player to use randomized strategies may lead to different models (and values). Finally, the PI will study the duality theory for investing with performance fees.

The theory was initiated by Francis J. Murray and John von Neumann in the 1930s, and since then researchers have discovered a vast number of applications to mathematics as well as biology, physics, and engineering. In particular, one of the modern fields that studies von Neumann algebras is free probability, wherein one views the theory of von Neumann algebras as a generalization of probability theory. This perspective yields connections to random matrix theory, allows one to model the statistical behavior of large-scale data sets, and notably has been used to understand the fundamental limits of wireless communications. Furthermore, connections with the mathematical disciplines of complex analysis, dynamical systems, group theory, and harmonic analysis arise from the study of derivations on von Neumann algebras, which are analogues of the derivative in Leibniz and Newton's theory of calculus. The so-called ""non-tracial"" von Neumann algebras admit additional connections to physics: they have an inherit dynamical system that satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition from quantum statistical mechanics; and they arise naturally in conformal field theory. This project is part of the principal investigator's research efforts to better understand non-tracial von Neumann algebras through the use of free probability and an analysis of derivations.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study the structure of non-tracial (type III) von Neumann algebras through three approaches, which are interconnected via free probabilistic distributions and derivations. The first approach concerns derivations on a von Neumann algebra, which lie within the scope of two major methodologies: Voiculescu's free probability theory, and Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. The former through free Fisher information and non-microstates free entropy, and the latter through deformations arising from the completely positive semigroups associated to closable derivations. The principal investigator seeks to show that derivations on non-tracial von Neumann algebras give rise to completely positive semigroups, and then use free probability and deformation/rigidity to extract structural information in the spirit of Peterson as well as Dabrowski and Ioana. The second approach concerns non-microstates regularity conditions on finite generating sets of von Neumann algebras equipped with non-tracial states, which can be regarded as non-commutative probability distributions and therefore analyzed with free probability. The principal investigator has shown that when these generators have finite free Fisher information and are well-behaved under the modular automorphism group associated to the state, then the von Neumann algebra they generate is a full factor. In recent work with Charlesworth on free Stein information, the principal investigator has found a weaker regularity condition than having finite free Fisher information that is more easily adapted to the non-tracial case. He will explore the structural consequences of this regularity condition for non-tracial von Neumann algebras, and attempt to adapt other existing regularity conditions to the non-tracial case. The third approach concerns random matrix models for non-tracial von Neumann algebras. In the tracial case, understanding the connection between the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and the free group factors has benefited random matrix theory by providing a clear picture of the large N limit, and has benefited free probability theory by providing finite dimensional approximations and informing the definition of microstates free entropy. The principal investigator has found a non-tracial version of the Dyson-Schwinger equation, which is a non-commutative PDE that (in the tracial case) makes explicit the connection between the GUE and the free group factors. A non-tracial Dyson-Schwinger equation gives rise to a free Araki-Woods factor, which were defined by Shlyakhtenko as the non-tracial analogue of the free group factors. The principal investigator aims to use non-tracial Dyson-Schwinger equations to develop random matrix models for free Araki-Woods factors, and more generally to develop microstates free entropy for non-tracial von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central prediction of quantum mechanics is that every degree of freedom has an irreducible minimum amount of motion. Under ordinary conditions quantum fluctuations emerge at random locations in space, persist for a brief time, and then disappear as new fluctuations emerge at other locations. However, a central prediction of cosmology is that the very early universe underwent a phase of accelerated expansion known as ""primordial inflation"". Quantum fluctuations of gravitational fields which emerge during primordial inflation persist indefinitely, and their strength builds up as new fluctuations emerge. These fluctuations change how particles propagate, how forces depend on space and time, and even how fast the universe expands. Although exact computations  are not possible, the standard method of successive approximations shows that these effects grow with time, and with separation in the case of force laws, until they become so strong that standard computational techniques break down. Some researchers doubt the reality of this conclusion because gravitational fields can give different results in different coordinate systems, like the famous Schwarzschild singularity at the event horizon of a black hole, which is really an artifact of bad coordinates. Establishing that the effects of quantum fluctuations from inflation are real, and devising a procedure for extrapolating them to regimes in which they are strong, has the potential to revolutionize fundamental theory. In particular, this project will establish whether or not some of the outlandish parameters (e.g., less than 5% of the current energy density composed of normal matter) that seem to describe our current universe can be explained by quantum effects which became strong during the phase of primordial inflation. This project will also promote teaching, training and learning. Although the PI's current and past graduate students were selected for proven ability, it is worth noting that half of them are either female or Hispanic.<br/> <br/>During the course of this project the PI and his graduate students will collaborate with Professors Shun-Pei Miao (Taiwan), Tomislav Prokopec (Holland) and Nikolaos Tsamis (Greece) on (1) demonstrating that the effects of gravitational fluctuations are not coordinate artifacts; (2) developing a technique for extrapolating them to regimes where they become strong; (3) modeling these phenomena using low energy effective field theory in the sense of Donoghue; and (4) studying comparable effects from other fields. Although there will be some numerical work, most of the analysis will be analytic and will employ the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, the renormalization group, Starobinsky's stochastic formalism and cosmological perturbation theory. Establishing that quantum gravitational fluctuations from primordial inflation induce measurable effects during the current epoch would revolutionize fundamental theory. Among other things, this has the potential to explain what caused primordial inflation, why the current universe is undergoing accelerated expansion and why Milgrom's MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) gives such an accurate description of galactic structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Fruit color plays an essential role in the life cycle of many plants by attracting animals who eat the fruits and carry the seeds away from the parent plant. Blue fruits are relatively rare, and some produce vivid colors without the use of pigments. They accomplish this via nano-scale structures in their cell walls that interfere with light to produce color. This research will identify new species that exhibit such structurally colored fruits, and describe the bio-physical mechanisms responsible for these colors. In addition, this work will examine the evolution of structural color in fruits from a group of trees native to Australia, the Indo-Pacific, and Southeast Asia. The project will inform our understanding of the evolution of rare traits (such as blue fruit color) as well as provide a platform for multi-disciplinary interaction between biologists, physicists, and material scientists. In addition, this work will provide training for the fellow and undergraduates who will be involved in the work. The project's findings will be disseminated through scholarly publications and conferences as well as to the public via outreach activities.<br/><br/>The paucity of known structurally colored fruits has limited hypotheses about the ecological function of structural color in fruits and the circumstances behind its evolution. Northeast Australia has a relatively high number of blue-fruited species, including two of the known structurally colored fruits, E. angustifolius and Delarbrea michieana. The fellow will rely on both herbarium and living collections in botanical gardens to 1) survey herbarium collections for new species that may exhibit structural color, 2) describe the biophysical mechanism behind structural color in new species using optical and transmission electron microscopy, and 3) test the hypothesis that structural color serves as an honest signal of high nutritional reward in Elaeocarpus using phylogenetic comparative methods. The fellow will quantify a variety of color, nutritional content, morphological traits, and cell wall nanostructures across Elaeocarpus. She will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team at the University of Colorado-Boulder and the University of Cambridge, train biology and physics undergrads, and participate in science outreach activities in both locations. The research has the potential for bioinspired and biomimetic engineering applications, and will improve our understanding of the origin, evolution, and ecology of rare structural colors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such nutritional symbioses occur frequently across many different organisms, including primates, plants, and insects. This research will investigate the joint evolutionary history of a highly successful and diverse group of insects, carpenter ants and their relatives, and the bacteria Blochmannia. Carpenter ants are the most diverse and abundant group of ants in the world - most kids have encountered them while playing outside. All carpenter ants carry Blochmannia bacteria inside their gut cells, making the bacterium an endosymbiont. Both organisms rely on one another to survive. Evidence indicates that carpenter ants and Blochmannia have maintained a close nutritional partnership for tens of millions of years. Obligate symbiotic associations among different kinds of organisms can profoundly impact the nature and tempo of the evolution of both partners, and microbial endosymbionts have been suggested to have played important roles in the diversification of some insect groups. This research will determine how the carpenter ants and their relatives evolved alongside Blochmannia. The findings will improve our understanding of how symbioses arise and are maintained in animals, with potential implications for the evolution of human-associated microbial systems. Moreover, the project will emphasize public education in ant biodiversity and microbial symbioses, and the training of early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This research will infer the phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeographic history of ants in the tribe Camponotini, and use this comparative framework to advance systematic and co-evolutionary studies of their endosymbiotic bacteria Blochmannia. Like other obligate endosymbionts, Blochmannia exhibits substantial genome reduction compared to free-living bacteria. Genome evolution and functional variation in Blochmannia will be evaluated across a phylogenetically representative selection of camponotine ants with contrasting morphological and ecological attributes. By jointly elucidating the ant and endosymbiont evolutionary histories, the project will address such questions as: (1) What are the major features of Blochmannia genome evolution across the Camponotini clade? (2) What processes shape rates and patterns of Blochmannia sequence evolution? (3) Is Blochmannia gene content variation associated with particular camponotine host attributes? By linking phylogenetic and trait data on the ants to functional genomic properties of the bacteria we will gain an understanding of the selective forces and constraints underlying this remarkable symbiosis. A detailed phylogeny of the camponotine ants will also create a strong foundation for much-needed monographic work on this taxonomically neglected group, and allow the development of more effective identification tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GEM Consortium aims to improve diversity in the STEM workforce through a two-pronged approach. First, GEM encourages selected underrepresented minority (URM) students to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields by ensuring that the students receive a living stipend and tuition while enrolled in a GEM member-university program. Next, GEM provides access to paid internships for the selected students, providing the students with work experience and networking opportunities. Ultimately this project works to illustrate and provide pathways for advanced STEM education and careers for URM students.<br/><br/>This project provides training pathways for both Ph.D. and Master's level students in STEM fields, particularly in Chemistry, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, and Physics. GEM consortium-selected URM students apply to the university-member programs, and upon acceptance, GEM provides a stipend towards living expenses and tuition.

As a society, we are becoming more aware of excessive noise around us, and the discomfort and health problems it creates. To address this problem, engineers and designers need efficient methods to include noise test data in the product design process. Current standards and methods for measuring sound power, which is the metric used to quantify noise produced by a product, require specialized acoustic chambers such that sound power testing is typically expensive and time consuming. As a result, sound power testing may not even be done, which limits the ability of designers to focus on and minimize noise in their products. This research will focus on developing a new vibration-based sound power measurement method that will allow engineers to efficiently acquire and use noise data to improve their products. The new method is not limited by many of the restrictions of current sound power measurement standards and can be used to make truly in situ measurements saving companies significant time and providing improved products.<br/><br/>A number of standards exist for measuring sound power.  However, these typically have restrictions such as requiring specific acoustic fields, reflective surfaces, and no varying background noise.  A new vibration-based method will be developed that is designed to overcome a number of these restrictions.  This new method treats the structure as an array of small, individual radiators, and estimates the sound power through the calculation of self- and mutual-impedances between the radiators. Expressions for these impedances have been developed for simple ideal structures. This research will utilize these expressions to validate the method of obtaining the sound power from vibration measurements. It will then focus on developing the theoretical and computational tools to account for arbitrarily shaped structures, coupled built-up structures, and components of built-up structures. Experimental verification of the new method will be carried out for these more complex structures by comparing results using the extended computational tools with results from existing standards. By overcoming some of the restrictions of current standards, the new method will also be used for truly in-situ testing. The new method is not meant to replace all other methods, but it will provide a practical vibration-based alternative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physicists use them to model ocean currents, weather patterns and turbulent flows behind a commercial jet or ship. Mathematicians and physicists believe that an explanation for and the prediction of both the breeze and the turbulence can be found through an understanding of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations. Although most physicists and engineers believe that the smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations will not break down without external forcing, currently there is no theoretical guarantee that this is indeed the case. Our recent study indicates that the Euler equations, a special case of the Navier-Stokes equations with zero viscosity, could develop a catastrophic behavior if one starts with a highly symmetric but perfectly smooth flow. Such a scenario corresponds to a perfect storm in which all things that could potentially go wrong indeed go wrong. Potentially singular behavior of the Navier-Stokes equations could post tremendous damage to our environment, affect the safety of our planes and ships, and our ability to do accurate weather forecasting. This award will investigate under what conditions the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations may develop singular behavior. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop effective analytical and computational tools that would enhance our ability to model and predict various complex phenomena in nature so that we can have more confidence in the safety of commercial jets and ships, and weather forecasting. Additional impact of this project will be the involvement of graduate students. The interdisciplinary training they receive in this project will be important for their future careers in mathematics and science.<br/><br/>The award seeks to understand whether the incompressible 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations could develop a finite-time singularity from a smooth initial condition with finite energy. A unique aspect of the research is the integration of highly resolved numerical simulations and rigorous mathematical analysis.  Our strategy is to reformulate the problem of proving finite time self-similar singularity into the problem of establishing the nonlinear stability of an approximate self-similar profile using the dynamic rescaling equation. We first construct a highly accurate self-similar profile using a high order numerical method. We then use the energy method with carefully chosen singular weight functions and take into account cancellation among various nonlinear terms to extract the inviscid damping effect from the linearized operator around the approximate self-similar profile. Our stability result enables us to prove that the dynamic rescaling solution converges to the steady state self-similar solution exponentially fast in time.  Moreover, by introducing a cut-off to the self-similar profile, we obtain a smooth initial condition with finite energy that develops a self-similar blowup in finite time. The novel approach of investigating finite-time singularity formation by studying the stability of spatial profiles in the potential singular solutions also forms the basis of a novel analytical framework for other nonlinear nonlocal systems of partial differential equations and has the potential to be applied to study a larger class of nonlinear dynamic problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Plants are at the base of all food chains, are vital to materials production, and maintain our atmosphere, making plant research critical for sustainability in a changing world. Plants isolate reactions involved in breaking down fats for energy and hormone production in subcellular compartments called peroxisomes. These reactions support growth and development throughout the life cycle, but also create toxic byproducts that can damage the peroxisome and the entire cell if not degraded. This project focuses on uncovering the mechanism responsible for 'taking the trash out' within cells. The goal is to identify signals responsible for targeting damaged or obsolete peroxisomes for decay in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Problems in 'taking the trash out' are believed to contribute to the aging processes in plants, as well as several peroxisome biogenesis disorders in humans. Given that over half of peroxisomal proteins are conserved between plants and humans, peroxisome research in Arabidopsis can impact both agriculture and human health, making it a vital process to study.<br/><br/>The cellular quality control used to manage damaged peroxisomes is a form of specialized autophagy (pexophagy) in which the cell creates a structure to engulf and discard the damaged peroxisome. The research will leverage the recent finding that functional peroxisomes are targeted for destruction by an overzealous autophagy machinery when an Arabidopsis multifunctional protease protein is dysfunctional, leading to the hypothesis that signals responsible for pexophagy are degraded or refolded by the multifunctional protease. Several protein studies will be used to identify interacting proteins, followed by studies to determine how and why the interaction regulates pexophagy. By identifying the signals regulating pexophagy, we can begin to elucidate the stressors that induce pexophagy, the benefits of increased and decreased pexophagy, and how to selectively regulate the activity. The project is designed to expand the expertise of the Fellow into organelle biology. Moreover, the project has manageable subprojects that will be executed by mentored undergraduates from historically underrepresented backgrounds, allowing the Fellow to hone mentoring and management skills needed to successfully run an independent research lab.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atomic-scale computer modeling of enzymes is part of the multibillion-dollar research effort that aids the design of new pharmaceuticals, helps investigate protein structure and function, and advances our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. Despite the widespread use and success of computational enzymology, quantitative relationships between the composition / size of the models and accuracy of simulations are still poorly understood, and comparison of methodologies is nearly impossible. This project will design an automated protocol for the computational study of enzymes using rationally-created and reproducible models, where hypotheses can be rigorously tested via a data-driven approach. In keeping with the Division of Biological Infrastructure?s focus on empowering biological discovery by investing in the development and enhancement of biological research resources, the developed protocol will be made available via a web platform and user interface. In addition, the project will establish a laboratory module for introductory biology courses to familiarize undergraduate students with the Protein Data Bank, enzyme kinetics, and computer modeling. Rule discovery and model building automation will pave the way to a reproducible, rational, and rigorous approach to computational enzymology. Improved research and project design standards will allow, for the first time, a truly quantitative assessment of accuracy in biochemical simulations. This research will impact a large, multidisciplinary swath of the STEM research community, from structural biologists, pharmacologists, and computational chemists in academia and industry, to the next generation of biology and biochemistry undergraduates. <br/><br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to design an automated protocol for the computational study of enzymes using rationally-created and reproducible models, where hypotheses can be rigorously tested via a data-driven approach.

RINRUS will guide research workflows by selecting crucial atoms in a protein structure to be included in computational models. RINRUS will then produce an enormous library of computationally tractable and chemically rigorous enzyme models, ready for production-quality simulations using molecular modeling software packages. Automated project design and standardization of research practices will allow the biochemical community to focus on higher-impact phenomena in protein structure and function. Community data sharing and calibration of enzyme models at an unprecedented scale will be facilitated by creation of a web-based repository and discussion forum.

The project will also enhance early science and math education in the Portland public school system through a range of activities that include science fairs, science nights, career days, mentoring high school student research, and school-initiated science programs.<br/><br/>In the bacterium Escherichia coli, completing replication involves an enzymatic system that limits cellular replication to its doubling point by allowing converging replication forks to transiently bypass each other before the excess, over-replicated regions are incised, resected, and joined.  The reaction initiates through the combined action of SbcCD-ExoI and requires RecBCD to join convergent strands of the replication fork.  In mutants where completing replication is impaired, cell viability becomes dependent on an aberrant form of recombination that also drives genetic instabilities.

Such nutritional symbioses occur frequently across many different organisms, including primates, plants, and insects. This research will investigate the joint evolutionary history of a highly successful and diverse group of insects, carpenter ants and their relatives, and the bacteria Blochmannia. Carpenter ants are the most diverse and abundant group of ants in the world - most kids have encountered them while playing outside. All carpenter ants carry Blochmannia bacteria inside their gut cells, making the bacterium an endosymbiont. Both organisms rely on one another to survive. Evidence indicates that carpenter ants and Blochmannia have maintained a close nutritional partnership for tens of millions of years. Obligate symbiotic associations among different kinds of organisms can profoundly impact the nature and tempo of the evolution of both partners, and microbial endosymbionts have been suggested to have played important roles in the diversification of some insect groups. This research will determine how the carpenter ants and their relatives evolved alongside Blochmannia. The findings will improve our understanding of how symbioses arise and are maintained in animals, with potential implications for the evolution of human-associated microbial systems. Moreover, the project will emphasize public education in ant biodiversity and microbial symbioses, and the training of early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This research will infer the phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeographic history of ants in the tribe Camponotini, and use this comparative framework to advance systematic and co-evolutionary studies of their endosymbiotic bacteria Blochmannia.

Genome evolution and functional variation in Blochmannia will be evaluated across a phylogenetically representative selection of camponotine ants with contrasting morphological and ecological attributes. By jointly elucidating the ant and endosymbiont evolutionary histories, the project will address such questions as: (1) What are the major features of Blochmannia genome evolution across the Camponotini clade?

By linking phylogenetic and trait data on the ants to functional genomic properties of the bacteria we will gain an understanding of the selective forces and constraints underlying this remarkable symbiosis.

The fellow's research explores how animal anatomy (form), movement (function), and environment (ecology) change together over the course of evolution. Although each of these pieces is important individually, learning how they change in connection with one another sheds light on what sparks the rapid appearance of new species, periods called adaptive radiations. The fellow's research uses bats as a model system to explore how these changes are connected. Bats comprise 20% of all living mammals and live on every continent except Antarctica. Part of what allows bats to colonize such varied places is that they evolved diverse roosting habits. The fellow hypothesizes that bats' ability to develop new roosting habits (ecology) is linked to changes in the wing skeleton (form) and landing maneuvers (function), and that these factors worked together to drive the evolution of the many bat species observed today. This work integrates form, function, and ecology, and sets the stage for future work that reveals how the many facets of animal biology work together to drive diversification across the 'tree of life'.

Interactions among lipids and proteins help organize the proteins spatially in the membrane. Interactions within each leaflet of the bilayer have been studied extensively; this project focuses on transverse interactions between the leaflets.  The project will develop a new experimental approach that uses lipid-coated droplets pressed against each other to form synthetic lipid bilayer membranes.  Measurements of certain characteristics of the interacting droplets and the membrane will allow the energetics of transverse lipid interactions to be determined quantitatively.  Findings from this research will show how differences in the compositions of the two leaflets of a bilayer affect cell function, which could inspire new therapeutics to detect and combat disease.

This project will exploit the fluidic properties of droplet interface bilayers to study these phenomena through a combination of tensiometry and electrophysiology.  Aqueous nanoliter droplets coated with ordered lipid monolayers will be manipulated into contact to form model lipid bilayer membranes with varying compositions in each leaflet. An imposed electric field across the membrane will produce both electrocompression and electrowetting, causing the membrane to simultaneously thin and expand.  Visual measurements of the membrane area and the angle of contact during this process will provide accurate values of the membrane thickness and the apparent bilayer tension without additional calibration.  Changes in the membrane tension during electrocompression will reflect lipid-lipid interactions within and between the lipid leaflets.  Model rafts or lipid subdomains will be created using photopolymerizable lipids, and changes in the membrane properties during electrocompression will be tracked as a function of the asymmetric distribution of these subdomains between the membrane leaflets.  This approach will provide experimental measurements of the mismatch energy generated by leaflet asymmetry, which has been hypothesized to drive collocation of the lipid domains.

One of them is the in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves - in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi, Riemann, Klein and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual landscaping of mathematical physics dictated by the progress of classical and quantum mechanics, and often associated with the names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein and Weyl. It is string theory that in the search for the ultimate laws of nature places algebraic curves at the center of modern fundamental physics, generating new mathematical questions and pointing out plausible answers with an amazing pace and persistence. Some of the problems we work on are motivated by such questions, some others hopefully provide answers that string theorist did not really anticipate.

From a formal homotopy theory viewpoint, K-theoretic invariants, as well as their cohomological predecessors, should be specializations of much more general cobordism-valued invariants. An approach, referred here as ""formal"", disregards the subtle stacky or orbifold properties of the moduli spaces, and should be contrasted with the ""genuine"" theory fully capturing these subtleties.  In this project, the PI and his collaborators will move beyond cohomological and K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants, and explore the possibility of defining and computing genuine, as opposed to formal, Gromov-Witten invariants with values in complex cobordisms. One direction is to include quantum ""chi-y""-theory (based on the Hirzebruch genus), with expected connections with, and applications to representation theory and quiver varieties.  Another direction is to explore the specialization to the theory (where y=-1) based on the topological Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of stable maps.

Alexander in 1932 is to find all the ways to divide a three-dimensional space into two pieces of a simpler type.  Minimal surfaces can be used as canonical surfaces to find such splittings.  The PI will also study related problems arising from variational principles, for instance the problem of Arnold which asks to find closed orbits of a particle subject to a magnetic field.  In addition to this research, the PI will focus on teaching and training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as advancing the field by organizing seminars, conferences and writing expository materials.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>More precisely, the objectives of this project are to develop new techniques to study minimal surfaces arising from the smooth min-max theory of Simon-Smith.    When minimal surfaces are constructed from multi-parameter sweep-outs, a basic and important open problem is whether they come with integer multiplicities.  The PI will work to show that the multiplicities are generically equal to one in the smooth setting.  One goal in this direction is to prove the Lusternick-Schnirelman Conjecture that every Riemannian three-sphere contains at least four embedded minimal two-spheres.  Such work requires developing quantitative versions of topological theorems, such as Cerf's theorem.  The PI will also use minimal surfaces to continue the study of classifying Heegaard splittings of three-manifolds.  The PI will also investigate related variational problems involving mean curvature such as obtaining the existence of closed curves of constant curvature on Riemannian two-spheres, a problem originating from physics and dynamical systems.  The techniques to be employed in these projects combine ideas from low-dimensional topology, analysis, Morse theory, and minimal surface theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These proteins, in turn, have key functions in cells. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Christine Phillips-Piro from Franklin and Marshall College to use non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), i.e., amino acids that do not occur in living systems, to investigate the structure and to systematically modify the function of proteins. The addition of new ncAAs results in unusual proteins that have very different functions than those made with the natural amino acids.  The research project provides interdisciplinary training for undergraduate researchers in chemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, and protein structure determination. Dr. Phillips-Piro's courses enable undergraduate students to learns about current scientific research. She integrates scientific literacy in two different courses - general chemistry and a general education course. Her team also helps to organize and run a regional chemistry conference for undergraduates (the Intercollegiate Student Chemists? Convention (ISCC)). Professor Phillips-Piro is a member of the Advanced Photon Source User Organization (APSUO) which seeks to broaden participation at Argonne National Laboratory. <br/><br/>The research supported by this award exploits a targeted collection of ncAAs being used to both study protein structure and tune protein function. Local environments in a thermostable heme nitric oxide and/or oxygen binding protein (H-NOX) are assessed by using the ncAA vibrational reporter 4-cyano-L-phenylalanine in concert with temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The systematic modulation of the the oxygen binding affinity of the heme protein is achieved by using tyrosine ncAAs with altered phenolic hydrogen acidity.  These moieties influence the strength of hydrogen bonding between a key amino acid residue (Y140) distal to the heme and the small molecule bound to the heme. Metal-binding ncAAs are used to generate a novel bimetallic enzyme based on the H-NOX scaffold. The insights gained and tools developed by Dr. Phillips-Piro may benefit other scientists who employ ncAAs to probe, modify, and/or engineer biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participants are from groups underrepresented in the Geosciences, include community college students, and either attend urban institutions or live in urban areas. The focus on urban systems allows students to conduct research relevant to their daily lives and communities, and demonstrates how scientific research can benefit society. Students are mentored by research active faculty at Rutgers University-Newark, receive professional development training, participate in enrichment activities, and interface with Newark community organizations and local government. Students are guided to pathways from community college and 4-year programs to careers in research. Creating career pathways for underrepresented students is essential, as racial minorities comprise 33% of the U.S. population, but only 14% of employed scientists and engineers. This represents an untapped human resource potential for STEM careers. Maximizing human resource potential is especially critical for urban areas, such as Newark, where there is a need for trained professionals to advance local environmental and sustainability efforts. The DUESS REU is designed to reinforce the interest of the students in Earth and Environmental Sciences, and have them appreciate the value of organized scientific research. It provides a critical link from success in college to graduate school and a potential research career. The result is improved participation and diversity in the Geosciences, and an increase in the number of appropriately trained scientists to meet the growing need nationwide.<br/><br/>DUESS REU participants will investigate the impact of concentrated human activity on the environment (soils, water, air, biota) and sustainability in urban systems. Students develop research projects within areas of faculty research expertise in Near Surface Geophysics, Urban Geochemistry & Biogeochemistry, and Urban Ecology, Sustainability & Biodiversity. The participants are primarily underrepresented minority (URM) students from 2-year and 4-year urban institutions. Students conduct DUESS themed research with faculty mentors; participate in professional development to integrate the research experience with the educational pathway; and engage in supporting activities that promote student-student, student-faculty and student-community interactions. The DUESS REU has six goals. 1) Recruit and provide research experiences and support for 3 cohorts of 12 academically talented students who are at least 60% URM and 50% Community College students by leveraging other NSF and non-NSF-funded programs at Rutgers University-Newark. 2) Develop an integrated research program for undergraduates that exposes them to cutting edge geoscience techniques. 3) Develop a research experience that builds from learning research techniques to helping formulate research plans. 4) Develop a model to engage urban URM students in advanced research by making it pertinent to their lives and interests. 5) Establish a clear pathway to encourage students to pursue careers in science that involve research. 6) Change the culture of the program to better incorporate integrated undergraduate research into the curriculum. This project will increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing careers in research and science, through a model for group place-based research in an urban environment that may be replicated in urban areas nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The gut microbiome is the community of bacteria that lives in an animal's gastrointestinal tracts. The microbiome helps shape the lives of their hosts across days, seasons, lifetimes, and generations. Captive wildlife, like those housed at zoos or research facilities, provide the opportunity to explore how the gut microbiome is controlled; however, compared to laboratory models, they remain untapped resources. The Biological Collections at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), including a living primate colony and a tissue bank, are well suited to microbiome research. The fellow will use these biological collections to test how diet, and the specific consumption of foliage, shape the gut microbiome across leaf eaters, fruit eaters, and omnivores in primates. Ultimately, the value of this project is twofold: (1) It will create knowledge about what controls the gut microbiome in primates, with potential applied value to human healthcare and wildlife conservation; and (2) Through diverse sponsorship, the project will stimulate dialogue across scientific disciplines and will lead to the development of resources for the research community.<br/><br/>The project will use Biological Collections to test the hypothesis that, compared to other feeding strategies, folivory more strongly drives host-microbiome coadaptation. In three studies, the fellow will probe how foliage consumption differentially drives gut-microbiome dynamics across folivorous, omnivorous, and frugivorous lemurs. Whereas the first study uses banked samples to compare microbiota along the species' gastrointestinal tracts, the second and third studies use the living colony, with study two asking how free-choice foraging shapes feeding and microbial ecology across seasonal scales, and study three using dietary manipulations to determine how cellulose and tannins regulate communities across daily scales. In addition to standard microbiome methods, during training residencies with sponsors Clayton and Eley, the fellow will develop metrics of dietary reconstruction from fecal samples via chloroplast sequencing, isotopic and wax-alkane analysis, and of microbiome dynamics via anaerobic and experimental culturing. The project is expected to yield research and review-style publications, and methodological descriptions. The fellow will mentor undergraduates throughout and work with the Duke Lemur Center's Education and Communication departments to create new materials for school children, the general public, and the social-media audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Very often the right and left hand forms interact differently with biological systems, sometimes with profound consequences. One hand may be beneficial while the other hand may also be beneficial, have no effect, or be harmful. As a result, the handedness property is an extremely important consideration in the design and manufacture of molecules such as pharmaceuticals. The most efficient syntheses of chiral molecules use catalysts that are also chiral.  Unfortunately, the synthesis of chiral catalysts often requires inefficient trial and error approaches. In this project, Professors Wiest and Helquist at the University of Notre Dame employ computational chemistry, machine learning, and organic chemistry to develop efficient, fast, and accurate methods to predict how to make chiral molecules. In collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company, these methods are improving access to molecules of importance to the pharmaceutical industry. This new approach to computationally-driven synthesis and the close, long-term collaboration with industry creates unique experiences for their students. These students participate in industrial internships and interdisciplinary training at AstraZeneca in Sweden.  The two senior researchers are actively engaging in broadening participation initiatives at the University of Notre Dame and in the Midwest. These activities include mentoring undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through the Building Bridges program and summer research for high school students.<br/> <br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Wiest and Dr. Helquist of the University of Notre Dame continue the development of the quantum guided molecular mechanics (Q2MM) method for the automated parameterization of transition state force fields (TSFFs) which are then used for the high-throughput virtual screening of enantioselective catalysts (CatVS).  A number of methodological improvements, such as machine learning, new interfaces, and automated parameterization procedures, and TSFFs for new reactions of interests for the synthetic organic community are developed. On the application side, the new methods are used for rapid prototyping of novel catalysts for hydrogen atom transfer reactions and for high throughput screening of virtual libraries for an enantioselective version of a novel cross-coupling reaction developed by the team. The Q2MM and CatVS code, as well as the validated force fields continue to be available to the scientific community free of charge via github.com/q2mm. The combined computational and experimental approach, combined with the close collaboration with AstraZeneca, provides a unique interdisciplinary training environment for the undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These boundaries create unsteady, three-dimensional, and asymmetrical flows that can increase the animal's flying/swimming speed and efficiency. Despite the wide implications of these benefits, there are no reliable models for near-boundary bio-locomotion. Accurate models could reshape the way biologists think about the flight strategies of birds migrating over open water or the evolutionary pressures on the shapes of bottom-dwelling fish. A better understanding of near-boundary lifestyles could help ecologists better predict the fragility of near-ground ecosystems to over-fishing, loss of habitat, or changing climate. Better models would also reshape the way engineers design bio-inspired vehicles that operate near boundaries. The key to improving these models is a better understanding of the complex flows governing near-boundary swimming and flying. The proposed work aims to shed light on these complex flows and bring them into public view using multimedia and an outreach program for middle school girls. <br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to understand the unsteady flow mechanisms governing near-boundary swimming. The project will support the first systematic study of unsteady ground effect through a combination of water channel experiments and inviscid flow simulations. As a result, classic steady ground effect theory will be generalized to the modern interdisciplinary flow phenomena present in swimming and flying animals. These flow phenomena will be explored by testing the effects of Strouhal number, reduced frequency, aspect ratio, undulation, and asymmetric kinematics on near-ground swimming. The research will focus on four specific aims: (i) developing scaling laws for the forces and energetics of near-ground swimming, (ii) mapping near-ground three-dimensional flow interactions, (iii) determining the role of undulatory kinematics in near-ground swimming, and (iv) understanding how asymmetrical kinematics alter near-ground flows. By including both experiments and inviscid simulations, the research will identify which effects are Reynolds-number dependent and which are driven purely by inviscid vortex dynamics.  This research will provide key insights into the near-ground lifestyles of fish and will aid in the design of novel bio-inspired underwater vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planet formation in the inner regions of a solar system is reasonably well understood. Further out - up to thousands of AU away from a parent star - there is no established model to explain recent startling discoveries of massive planets in these areas. The researchers will analyze recently-gathered survey data from the Keck Observatory to establish if and how the number and mass of planets in the outer reaches of a solar system depends on the mass of the parent star. The form of this dependence (or its lack) might shed light on the new Disk Instability model as a potential formation mechanism. The survey data represent 400 young, low-mass red dwarf stars, and comprises the largest survey in this stellar mass range.

Separations of alkanes from alkenes, for example propane from propylene, are among the most difficult and energy intensive. Improving these separations processes is vital to decreasing the cost and environmental impact of commodity chemicals and plastics production. Microporous materials such as zeolites enable separations based on differences in molecular size. Efforts to further enhance zeolite separation efficiencies require new methods for controlling interactions between the gases and sorbents. This project will develop a new approach to selectivity control that uses deposition of tailored organic ligands on the zeolite surface and pores. By controlling the properties of the ligands, it is possible to regulate their location on the microporous material as well as the effective size and chemical functionality of the pores. Achieving this enhanced level of control can yield dramatic improvements in separations of molecules of similar size, including propylene and propane. Both experimental and computational methods will be used to understand how the organic ligands bind with zeolites and how the organic-modified material affects sorption and diffusion of alkanes, alkenes, and other key gases. The overall research effort is directed toward enabling the design of improved materials for gas separations. This research is also closely linked with discovery-based learning for undergraduate and high school students and with development and dissemination of online learning tools for science and engineering students at different education levels. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new approach to selectivity control in separations. The approach employs the controlled deposition of organophosphonic acid ligands used in organic self-assembly processes to tailor the zeolite external surface and pores. Changes in the chemical structure of the ligands can be used to control their organization within the zeolites and can yield dramatic improvements in the selective adsorption of molecules of similar size, including propylene and propane. A combination of experimental and computational techniques will be used to develop structure-property relationships for ligand-modified zeolites. By varying both the zeolite structure and the size of the ligands, these studies will examine cases in which deposition is confined to the external surface of the zeolites, as well as situations where the modifiers can partially or fully enter the zeolite pores. The project will also focus on determining how the nature of the organic ligand can be tuned to alter diffusion of gases into the zeolite based on changes in ligand-gas affinities. Finally, quantum and classical molecular modeling tools will be employed to design improved combinations of ligands and zeolites tuned for selected separations such as propane-propylene and CO2-methane. The project will develop understanding of and the ability to control separations processes that account for major energy expenditures in the chemical industry. The proposed research will be carried out in conjunction with graduate, undergraduate, and high school students; this team will collaboratively develop and implement level-appropriate research, mentoring, and outreach goals. The team will also develop student-accessible active learning tools related to sorption- and membranes-based separations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By socially interacting with such a robot, learners can potentially reason and talk about the things they are learning and receive help in seeing the relevance of STEM in their daily lives. However, little is known about how to design educational robots to work with youth at home over a long period of time. This project will develop an informal science learning program, called STEMMates, in collaboration with a local community center, for youth with little interest in science. The program will partner learners with an in-home learning companion robot, designed to read books with youth and provide science activities for them at the community center, where youth will engage in exciting and personally relevant science learning. As the learner reads books, the robot will make comments about what is happening in the book to help connect the reading to the science activities at the community center. The overarching goals of STEMMates are to: (a) positively support youth's individual interest in science and future science learning, (b) connect in-home learning experiences with out-of-school community-based learning, (c) bridge the gap between formal and informal engagement and learning in science, and (d) encourage the participation of youth who are underrepresented and who have low interest in STEM learning. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning opportunities for the public in informal environments.<br/><br/>Researchers will work with youth and staff at the community center, alongside experts in informal science learning, to design the program and then test how learners respond to reading with the robot and participating in the science activities and whether this program has a lasting impact on their science interest. Social interactions with a robot may help distribute cognitive load during learning activities to help youth reason about STEM and also supplement learning by improving feelings of value and belongingness in order to facilitate lasting interest development. Following a mixed-methods research approach using qualitative and quantitative data-collection techniques, the research team will investigate the following research questions: (1) What social and interest-development supports and activities can be utilized as socially situated interest scaffolds in an informal and in-home, augmented reading and science activity program to promote individual interest and learning in science for low interest learners? How can a social robot best facilitate this program? (2) How do learners perceive and interact with the robot in authentic, in-home, long-term situations, and how does this interaction change over time? (3) Does working with a robot designed with socially situated interest scaffolds increase individual interest in science when compared to a pre-intervention baseline, and do these effects impact future (long-term) interest and engagement in formal science learning? To answer these research questions, researchers will implement the science learning program during an 11-week summer deployment and utilize an AB single-case research design. Interview-based qualitative data and self-report surveys to examine the learner?s perception of the robot and their evolving interest in science and quantitative data on science learning using pre-/post-measure comparisons will be collected. Log data of time-on-task, reading rate, book selection and reading goal attainment will also be collected by the robot. The outcomes of this project will lay the groundwork for future investigations of the design of social robots for a diversity of learner populations and their use in different informal learning settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LCO consists of a network of 22 robotic telescopes spaced around the globe, which are capable of rapid initial observations followed by continuing SNe observations for hundreds of days. This project will help to fund the Global Supernova Project, which pools discoveries from every major local universe supernova search program, screens hundreds of potential candidates, and triggers prompt and long-term monitoring of the most interesting targets across the electromagnetic spectrum.  The research project will also foster education by giving students in the LCO schools program opportunities to observe SNe with the network, obtain real science data, and learn from provided curricula. The investigators will engage in public outreach including public talks, radio, TV, print, and YouTube appearances and interviews.  Finally, supporting a successful public-private partnership through the LCO should encourage more private funding of astronomy.<br/><br/><br/>The observing program has an aim of answering the following questions. (1) What are Fast Rising Luminous Transients?  Proposed answers range from the shock breakout of a supernova, a failed blue supergiant supernova, an electron capture supernova, fallback onto a shrouded central engine with jets, the merger of white dwarfs to become a magnetar, and the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate mass black hole. Are these more than 80 poorly observed transients (only AT2018cow has been well observed) even the same phenomena?  (2) Are there two classes of SN Ia progenitors as is currently thought?  For the single compact object progenitors, what is the distribution of inferred companion radii? Do these SNe share traits in terms of host galaxy properties, line velocities, composition, or subtype, which would allow us to separate them into a new class or identify them by other means?  (3) What fraction of supernovae have flash ionized features from circumstellar material lost by the progenitor in the weeks before the SN and how does this correlate with the luminosity function and other properties? What are the radii and structure of core-collapse progenitors as determined from shock cooling?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, many meshing algorithms used in practice (essentially all used in  three dimensions) are based on heuristics rather than rigorously justified methods. The PI's earlier work on meshing in 2 dimensions is based on exploiting ideas from conformal geometry and dynamics, and uses the PI's  earlier work on optimal algorithms for computing conformal mappings. The PI plans  to continue his work in 2 dimensions to find the optimal meshing algorithms and to seek analogous approaches in 3 dimensions. Conformal maps send one planar region to another in a way that preserves angles. Such maps have been studied for almost two hundred years and are fundamental to many areas including complex analysis, dynamics, fluid flow and probability. The connection with probability arises most strongly through Brownian motion,  the mathematical model of continuous random motion.  Conformal maps send Brownian paths to Brownian paths, and this `conformal invariance' allows probabilistic arguments to be applied in complex analysis and allows complex analysis to be used to study Brownian motion. The  project considers  another well known, but difficult to understand, random process related to conformal maps: diffusion limited aggregation (DLA for short). In DLA  particles wander at random in space until they make contact with a fixed cluster of particles and stick to it. As time progresses the cluster grows and takes a characteristic fractal shape, at least in numerical simulations; very little is known rigorously about the geometry of the resulting random clusters. Based on numerical simulations, the project considers new conjectures on DLA that may be more tractable. The above problems seek to use classical analysis to understand problems that are discrete in nature. Another aspect of the project is to use discrete ideas to attack  problems in continuous analysis. The PI previously introduced a new method, called quasiconformal folding, for constructing holomorphic maps that that emphasizes the discrete and combinatorial structure of holomorphic function. Using this method, the PI and other investigators have constructed examples that answered a number of open problems, including several in the field of holomorphic dynamics. This is the study of stable versus chaotic behavior when a function is  iterated, e.g.,   the Julia set of a map is a fractal set where the sequence of iterates acts chaotically. Determining the possible geometries  of this set is a fundamental problem, and the PI will work on specific conjectures  the case of general holomorphic functions defined on the whole complex plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The project consists of problems grouped into five main categories, but all dealing with the interaction of discrete combinatorial structures (usually trees or triangulations) with continuous problems related to complex analysis and conformal geometry (Riemann surfaces, holomorphic dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, computational geometry and statistical physics). The first part deals  with conformal structures induced by trees and graphs. Grothendieck's theory of ""dessins d'enfants"" shows that a finite graph on a compact topological surface induces a conformal structure on that surface, e.g., makes it into a Riemann surface. Several problems in the  project  seek to understand this connection precisely, e.g., given a finite tree in the plane, what does the tree ""look like"" in the induced conformal structure?  A related problem is to build a Riemann surface by identifying edges of equilateral triangles. It is known that not every compact surface occurs in this way (only countably many can occur), but the PI conjectures that every non-compact surface does occur in this way (joint work with Lasse Rempe-Gillen). The second group of problems deals with transcendental dynamics, i.e., the iteration theory of non-polynomial entire functions. Quasiconformal folding is a method of building entire functions, starting from an infinite planar tree, that gives very good control of the geometry of the function and locations of its critical values. The PI seeks to apply QC folding to various problems, such as the possible Hausdorff and packing dimension of transcendental Julia sets, and the behavior of these dimensions under perturbations of the function. The third part of the  project is to expand on recent work of the PI and Claude LeBrun that constructed examples 4-manifolds where the almost-Kahler structures form a non-empty,  proper open subset in the moduli space of ant-self-dual metric; such examples were not previously known to exist. The proof works by reducing to questions about harmonic measure on certain (very complicated)  hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Can simpler 3-manifolds be used? Are the ""exotic"" examples constructed actually ""common"" in some sense? The fourth part deals with optimal meshing problems in 2 and 3 dimensions. The PI recently proved that any planar domain bounded by a PSLG (planar straight line graph) can be meshed by non-obtuse triangles (maximum angle 90 degrees)  in polynomial time, but the optimal power remains open. The proof uses  a discrete closing lemma for certain flows associated to any triangulation and  perhaps ideas from surface dynamics might help close the gap. The proof uses several estimates from planar geometry, and it would be a very interesting and important to extend the results to triangulated surfaces, a stepping stone to the  important problem of meshing 3-dimension regions by non-obtuse tetrahedra. A key idea in the planar case is to decompose the region into pieces where either Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry is used to generate a mesh.  Can a similar strategy be used in three dimensions, perhaps using the wider variety of fundamental geometries that occur in three dimensions? Finally, the PI will consider diffusion limited aggregation (DLA), a widely studied random growth model.  The basic problem is to determine the almost sure growth rate of the cluster; there is no non-trivial lower bound and no  improvement of Kesten's 1987 upper bound.  The PI plans break the growth rate problem into two sub-problems: estimating upper bounds for the number of vertices on the convex hull boundary of DLA, and turning these into non-trivial lower bounds for the growth rate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous cells in the body are electrically active. They produce electrical impulses, and these impulses through which nerve cells code and transmit information, endocrine cells secrete hormones, and muscle cells initiate contraction. Understanding the electrical activity of these cells is fundamental to understanding their behavior. This is, no easy task, since the electrical activity is mediated by ion flow through several types of ion channels in the cell membrane interacting in nonlinear ways through the membrane potential. Adding to this complexity, there are numerous intracellular signaling molecules acting on some of these channels and modifying their behavior. This project focuses on oscillations in the membrane potential of insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, stress-hormone-secreting pituitary cells, and cells of the cardiac ventricles. These oscillations can be beneficial or pathological, depending on the cell type. One objective of this project is to understand why the oscillations happen and, in the case that they are pathological, to determine how they can be terminated. Another objective is to train undergraduate and graduate students in the theory and application of sophisticated mathematical techniques that are directly applicable to biological systems. This training is facilitated through the interaction with several experimental labs.<br/><br/>The variables that describe an electrically excitable cell often vary on significantly different times scales. Some variables adapt quickly to changes in the cell's membrane potential, while others adapt more slowly. In such cases, oscillations in the membrane potential can occur at the level of the subsystem of fast variables, or at the level of the slow subsystem, or at some intermediate level that involves variables from both subsystems. To understand the basis of the oscillations, system variables should be partitioned in an appropriate way, facilitating the use of geometric singular perturbation analysis, or fast/slow analysis. This project employs fast/slow analysis in the examination of bursting oscillations in pituitary corticotrophs and pancreatic beta-cells, and pathological early after depolarizations (EADs) in ventricular myocytes.  The former drive the secretion of hormones, while the latter can lead to, at the tissue level, ventricular tachycardia. The fast/slow analysis of the different models will uncover the mechanisms through which modulators of cell behavior, such as corticosteroids or glucose or hypokalemia, act to move the cell among distinct behaviors, some rhythmic and some not. It will also be used to understand the effects of different stimulus frequencies on EAD production in ventricular myocytes, which normally receive periodic stimulation from the sinoatrial node in situ.

Nonlocal equations are used to describe a wide variety of physical and biological phenomena. Nonlocality means that a small perturbation in one location can affect the entire system. The project will enhance the tool-box available to mathematicians and widen the class of models that can be studied rigorously. There are three interconnected topics. The first is tumor growth models. The aim is to establish connections between models that describe the tumor at a cellular level and those that characterize the tumor as a region with a law governing the movement of its boundary. The second topic is evolutionary ecology. Rigorous analysis of the relevant PDEs will be used to study the dynamics of populations in which individuals can migrate as well as undergo mutation between generations. The third topic concerns numerical methods for certain PDEs. The mathematical ideas involved will also be used to develop algorithms for getting many autonomous robots to perform a cooperative task (examples include robotic pollinating bees or automated surveillance). The three topics making up the project have the potential to impact several areas of broader interest to society - namely, medicine, ecology, and technological development. The project will promote scientific progress by increasing our understanding of mathematics and by strengthening the connections between it and other disciplines. In addition, the principal investigator will teach and mentor students, as well as conduct outreach to the broader community.<br/><br/>The project will shed light on multiple classes of PDEs. Degenerate diffusion equations and free boundary problems underlie the work on tumor growth models. The aim is to study these equations and establish rigorous connections between them. The goal of the work on evolutionary ecology is to understand propagation phenomena in nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations. An important tool is the link between these PDEs and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The third topic concerns novel numerical methods for second order PDEs and involves understanding the structure of the PDEs and their regularizations. The aim is to prove convergence of the numerical methods, as well as to use these tools to develop algorithms in robotic control. An important theme connecting the three topics is nonlocality. Nonlocal PDEs often lack a comparison principle, which is a key tool in the study of classical PDEs. Moreover, some equations to be studied are conjectured to be unstable with respect to initial condition. Being able to overcome this, and even studying the causes and effects of instability, will be a significant development, and may lead to progress on other problems. In addition, this work will involve understanding and developing new notions of weak solution. In many real-world systems, it is natural to expect degeneracy or non-differentiability to form; so, for PDEs to be useful in these contexts, a novel sufficiently robust notion of solution is needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mathematical models are of relatively recent vintage and have proved to be very effective for modeling certain challenging phenomena, such as fracture in solid mechanics. For example, understanding how materials behave, their failure as well as their strength when deformed, is crucial for their proper usage and also for the design of new materials with potential impact on manufacturing, materials engineering, and related technologies. For this purpose, models with varied levels of success have been proposed in the past. The PI aims to develop basic mathematical techniques that will deliver a sound analytical footing for the recently proposed ""peridynamic model"" as well as other nonlocal models of continuum mechanics. The findings will also be applicable to additional models having similar structure, with applications in social and biological sciences. The activities will not only contribute to the success and effectiveness of attempts on modeling development and experimental validation but will also ensure that future modeling and simulation efforts based on these nonlocal theories will be more quantitative and reliable. This project will provide opportunities and support for the training of graduate students. The Principal Investigator will integrate the findings of the project into classroom teaching and other educational endeavors.<br/><br/>This project concerns the development of theory and techniques for nonlocal models in mechanics in general and for the peridynamic model in particular. These models are characterized by their effective description of continuous as well as discontinuous fields within a single mathematical framework by using integral equations instead of differential equations. The models have been successfully applied to better describe jump stochastic processes, anomalous diffusion, and spontaneous formation and propagation of cracks in solids, to name a few applications. However, the models have also presented the scientific community with new mathematical challenges. This research is devoted to exploring some analytical issues while at the same time laying the necessary mathematical foundation for future studies of nonlocal and peridynamic models. Issues to be addressed include demonstratiing well posedness of linearized nonlocal models of practical interest, establishing a rigorous connection with well-studied strain-gradient models,  proving regularity properties of solutions of nonlocal equations as a function of the data, and implementing variational techniques to study some aspects of nonlocal nonlinear problems. The approaches involve various tools that lead to extensions of classical mathematical concepts and techniques to the nonlocal setting, including perturbation methods, calculus of variations, and nonlinear functional analysis. Furthermore, the basic mathematical infrastructure that will be worked out is likely to impact the development of effective and reliable finite element methods and other numerical schemes to solve complex engineering problems that involve nonlocality. The research will make nonlocal and peridynamics-based modeling and simulation more mathematically consistent, quantitative, and predictive in practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deformation or strain localization is an important phenomenon throughout the crust, resulting in major contrasts in rock strength that impact crustal architecture and tectonics, fluid flow, and potential seismicity.  The researchers hypothesize that the factors that control strain localization vary by scale.  The PI proposes to unravel the factors causing strain localization at a variety of scales within metasedimentary rocks at a major tectonic structure, the Southern Iberian Shear Zone in southwestern Spain. A diverse, international team of geoscience faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students will perform this research by collecting integrated structural geology, geomatics, and geochemical datasets through an international field-based program of research and mentorship. Each year, four undergraduates and one graduate student will spend up to four weeks in Spain conducting fieldwork and perform follow-up analyses at UWM for a minimum of 13 weeks.<br/><br/><br/>Strain localization processes in the lithosphere are fundamental to our understanding of plate tectonics. While deformation may be pervasive throughout tectonic zones, deformation intensity is often strongly localized. Factors that may control strain localization include rheology contrasts and mechanical boundaries, differences in mineralogy or grainsize, fabric formation, and various grain-scale softening mechanisms, which are often enhanced by fluids.  The primary scientific goal is to unravel multi-faceted causes of strain localization within metasedimentary rocks affected by the Southern Iberian Shear Zone and determine if and how they vary with scale. Faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students will collect integrated lithology, tectonic fabric, microstructure, geomatics, and geochemical datasets through a field-based program of research and mentorship. The strength of this project lies in the integrated datasets derived from a suite of relatively modest graduate and undergraduate student projects.  Brought together through careful spatial mapping and the integrated 3D digital model, these disparate datasets can create a holistic picture of strain localization.  These results will help further our understanding of strain localization and shear band formation in other metapelitic units in a wide array of tectonic settings.

The durability of these thin polymer film interfaces is critical to their long-term performance. A thorough understanding of the properties of these films is also important in microelectronics fabrication where nanostructured polymer thin film patterns are used to fabricate complex circuitry. As production rates for these processes increase, an understanding of the dynamic performance of these thin film patterns becomes more and more critical. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research to create a new experimental technique to measure the properties of material property gradients in polymer thin films under dynamic loading conditions. This research will generate critical experimental data on material property gradients and interface conditions under dynamic loading conditions. This data can be used for the enhancement of computational modeling of these material systems and enable the design of new multi-layer film systems. Insight from this research will also drive new fabrication strategies to enhance the long-term performance of engineered flexible components. Enhancements to their performance would directly impact the nation's soft robotics, manufacturing and healthcare systems by enabling more durable devices for skin mounted sensors and flexible robots. This project will provide opportunities to educate and train graduate students in advanced experimental techniques that could be applied across many engineering fields. The project will also impact undergraduate education through research experiences for undergraduates with a focus on underrepresented students. <br/><br/>The performance of thin polymer films and multi-layer films depends highly on the gradient of material properties through the thickness of the film. These properties are altered relative to the bulk polymer material due to chemical interactions with the substrate and geometrical confinement. Similarly, the failure and dynamic behavior of polymer-matrix based composites is often dominated by the interface/interphase properties between the reinforcement and the matrix materials. This research aims to implement, demonstrate and evaluate a novel acoustics based experimental technique for the simultaneous measurement of stress-strain behavior gradients through the thickness near soft, bi-material interfaces and adhesion properties at these interfaces. Two specific material systems will be addressed, polymer thin films and the interphase region in polymer-matrix composites. Material property data will be collected over a wide range of dynamic loading conditions.

These earthquakes have the potential to generate tsunamis that impact people and cities many thousands of miles from the location of the earthquake. The study of subduction zones and their earthquake and tsunami potential is often difficult, though, because much of the region where the geophysical and geological signals occur that are diagnostic of subduction zone behavior is underwater. This limitation in turn requires researchers to make simplifications of Earth behavior, such as whether the Earth behaves elastically like a rubber band or viscously like candle wax, that can negatively impact estimates of earthquake and tsunami potential. This project will use unique observations of a subduction zone in southern Pakistan and Iran, the Makran Subduction Zone, to better quantify how the rocks surrounding a subduction zone fault behave over time. This location provides a unique opportunity to better characterize subduction zones around the world because much of this subduction zone is exposed above the surface of the ocean. This means that the researchers will be able to quantify the behavior of the subduction zone with unprecedented detail using satellite monitoring tools. The Broader Impacts of the project include quantifying the future earthquake potential of the Makran Subduction Zone where an earthquake-generated tsunami would impact cities throughout the western Indian Ocean basin, including the megacities of Mumbai, pop. 23.9 million, and Karachi, pop. 16.9 million. The project also supports a graduate student and research in an EPSCoR state.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goals above, the researchers will use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis to quantify post-seismic deformation caused by an Mw7.7 earthquake in within the Makran accretionary prism. Preliminary analysis of this deformation signal indicates that most of the accretionary prism itself undergoes viscoelastic relaxation at relatively shallow depths (<20 km). By combining InSAR time series analysis with finite element modeling approaches, we will quantify the rheological structure and viscosities of the Makran accretionary prism, whether power-law viscoelastic behavior is required to explain the geodetic observations, and what deformation mechanisms are active to accommodate the post-seismic relaxation. Because InSAR observations miss the first 15 months of post-seismic deformation, a period when afterslip is expected to be a dominant deformation process, the researchers will explore new approaches in optical imagery time series analysis using Landsat-8 imagery, with the goal of quantifying early afterslip. Afterslip estimates will be incorporated into viscoelastic relaxation simulations to provide a more complete and unbiased model of the rheological structure of the Makran accretionary prism. Finally, this project will incorporate this rheological model into interseismic coupling models of the Makran Subduction Zone in an effort to better estimate the locking distribution and locking rate of the Makran megathrust. These results will additionally demonstrate the importance, or lack thereof, of including viscoelastic accretionary prisms in subduction zone locking models elsewhere in the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop and characterize a new magnetic separation approach based on cell membrane-encapsulated iron oxide superparticles (a cluster of nanoparticles) for the separation and identification of bioactive compounds from natural products. This method overcomes limitations of costly and time-intensive conventional approaches and the nonspecific binding problems of magnetic bead separation techniques. The new approach is also broadly applicable to many different types of transmembrane drug targets. The success of this project will advance industrial processes for identification and extraction of new drug leads from complex samples. The impact of this project will be further enhanced through student-led educational and outreach activities, including: (a) establishing a goal-oriented training mechanism and relevant course work for undergraduate researchers and (b) developing a STEM lead the way program with an emphasis on math concept building. Specific science outreach projects to be developed are Science middle school-targeted Olympiad training modules and magnetic fishing experiments for elementary school students through the ""Science Party for Kids"" program. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a new magnetic separation approach based on cell membrane-encapsulated iron oxide superparticles (CSMPs) for the identification and separation of bioactive compounds from natural products. CSMPs will feature immobilized cell membranes with fully functional receptors that allow for identification of compounds specifically binding to the transmembrane receptors. The full encapsulation of magnetic superparticles inside a cell membrane overcomes the non-specific binding problems associated with the current magnetic bead separation technology. The use of magnetic superparticles enables rapid identification and extraction of compounds targeting transmembrane proteins. The CSMP approach is also easily translated to different transmembrane protein targets, which significantly broadens the applicability of this separation technique. Toward the overall objective, the PIs will develop, characterize, and evaluate the CSMP approach using cell membranes with functional nicotinic receptors to effectively identify binding compounds both in an artificial mixture (known binders and non-binders) and cigarette smoke condensates. The technique will be further verified using cell membranes with functional transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (e.g., TRPV1) and voltage-gated sodium channels.

The spheres, which are among the simplest geometric objects, are building blocks for more complex entities. The homotopy groups of spheres are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to deformations. They are used to study the connections between these basic components. These groups and the tools used to study them have deep connections with other fields. For example, there are connections with number theory as interesting functions and sequences appear as patterns and structure in the homotopy groups of spheres. There are connections with differential geometry, as these groups are used in the classification of geometric objects. Recently, the tools used to study the homotopy groups groups of spheres have also been used in physics in the classification of phases of matter. Although the study of the homotopy groups of spheres is notoriously difficult, a bridge has been built between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that allows us to use sophisticated algebraic theory to enable calculations of the homotopy groups of spheres. This bridge is known as chromatic homotopy theory and is the central theme of this project. Duality and invertibility are ubiquitous concepts in mathematics which are central to understanding relationships between mathematical objects. The project supported by this award studies these phenomena within chromatic homotopy theory. The project also proposes theory and computations that will provide data to help study these fundamental phenomena.<br/><br/>At the heart of chromatic homotopy theory is the study of a higher analogue of the homotopy category of spectra local with respect to mod p K-theory: The K(n)-local stable homotopy category. It is equivalent to the homotopy category of K(n)-local E-modules in G-equivariant spectra, where Morava E-theory E is a higher analogue of p-complete K theory and the stabilizer group G is a generalization of the group of Adams operations. The strategy of the proposal is to restrict problems to finite subgroups F of G and use the theory of finite resolutions to pass from information obtained from finite subgroups to information about the K(n)-local category. An important circle of ideas in the proposal concerns duality and invertibility. The PI and collaborators study K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead duality using techniques from equivariant homotopy theory. They use an analogue of the J-homomorphism to compute the duals of homotopy fixed point spectra for the action on E of some finite subgroups F of G. This homomorphism is also used to study Picard groups of categories of K(n)-local E-module F-spectra. The PI is an expert in computations at chromatic height 2 for p = 2 and proposes projects to further our understanding in this difficult case. These include the computation of the Picard group of the K(2)-local category, the study of K(2)-local Brown-Comenetz duality and computations of K(2)-local homotopy groups for finite spectra. Advancements in chromatic homotopy theory at height 2 have informed our understanding of K(n)-local phenomena. The PI proposes various projects to generalize this insight at higher heights. Finally, the project also examines one of the most important problems in chromatic homotopy theory, the chromatic splitting conjecture, which plays a central role in the relationship between chromatic homotopy theory and the algebraic geometry of formal groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large energy density fluctuations can lead to large fluctuations of spacetime geometry, which is an aspect of quantum gravity. This work can help clarify the relation between relativity theory and quantum theory, which is major unsolved problem in fundamental physics. It may also help understand the processes in the early history of our universe, such as phase transitions and black hole nucleation. The project will also study analog models in condensed matter systems, such as light propagation in nonlinear optical materials and density fluctuations in liquids. The results may have application to other areas of science and possibly to technology. The project will contribute to education through the participation of students, and development of new ways to explain subtle concepts to students.<br/><br/>This research will study probability distributions for spacetime averaged quantum stress tensors, and their physical applications. These distributions have been shown to fall relatively slowly, leading to a relatively large probability of large fluctuations. The details of this effect will be studied in more detail through a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The physical implications of the large fluctuations will also be studied. These may include increased rates of false vacuum decay, which will have implications for the study of phase transitions in the early universe, and nucleation of primordial black holes. Analog models, such as quantum density fluctuations in fluids, will also be studied. Here the probability distribution is expected to be similar to those for quantum stress tensor fluctuations, and may be accessible to experimental investigation.

These fundamental processes depend on the transport of babies (larvae) by the ocean currents, yet because the larvae are microscopic and diluted in the vastness of the ocean, it is very difficult to determine where and how they drift.  This project uses an autonomous underwater vehicle to collect larvae from precise regions of the water column.  Larval traps on the bottom and chemical analyses of larval shells will also be used to determine the depths where larvae swim.  These findings will provide realistic estimates for mathematical models that show how biology interacts with ocean currents to predict which methane seeps will be colonized by larvae originating at different depths.  A detailed knowledge of larval dispersal is needed for conservation and management of the deep sea. Without such information, we cannot know the best placement of marine protected areas, nor can we facilitate the reestablishment of communities impacted by deep-sea mining, drilling, or other human activities.  This project will provide hands-on at-sea training for college students to learn the rapidly vanishing skills needed for studies of larvae and embryos in their natural habitats.  Learning opportunities will also be available to individuals of all ages through new, interactive exhibits on deep-sea biology and larval ecology produced for small museums and aquaria on the coasts of Oregon, Washington and North Carolina.  <br/><br/>Reliable estimates of connectivity among metapopulations are increasingly important in marine conservation biology, ecology and phylogeography, yet biological parameters for biophysical models in the deep sea remain largely unavailable. The movements of deep-sea vent and seep larvae among islands of habitat suitable for chemosynthesis have been inferred from current patterns using numerical modeling, but virtually all such models have used untested assumptions about biological parameters that should have large impacts on the predictions. This project seeks to fill in the missing biological parameters while developing better models for predicting the dispersal patterns of methane seep animals living in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Western Atlantic Margin. Despite the existence of similar seeps at similar depths on two sides of the Florida peninsula, the Western Atlantic seeps support only a subset of the species found in the Gulf of Mexico. It is hypothesized that the ability of larvae to disperse through the relatively shallow waters of the Florida Straits depends on an interaction between the adult spawning depth and the dispersal depth of the larvae. Dispersal depth, in turn, will be influenced by larval flotation rates, swimming behaviors, feeding requirements, and ontogenetic migration patterns during the planktonic period.  The recently developed SyPRID sampler deployed on AUV Sentry will be used to collect larvae from precise depth strata in the water column, including layers very near the ocean floor. Larval traps deployed on the bottom at three depths in each region will be used in conjunction with the plankton collections to determine what proportion of larvae are demersal. Comparisons of stable oxygen isotopes between larval and juvenile mollusk shells will provide information on the temperatures (and therefore depths) that larvae develop, and geochemical analyses of larval and juvenile shells will determine whether larval cohorts mix among depth strata. Ocean circulation and particle transport modeling incorporating realistic biological parameters will be used to predict the movements of larvae around the Florida Peninsula for various spawning depths and seasons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials have properties between those of liquids and solids and are constructed from molecules that contain aromatic rings.  In organic chemistry, aromatic molecules are very stable and do not readily react with other substances.  Since chemical bonds consist of electrons, aromatic rings are capable of conducting electricity and light in optical data storage, similar to molecular-scale wires.  Professor Reczek designs and constructs an interactive educational exhibit, ""The Solar Station"".  He also organizes and conducts a hands-on ""Chemistry Challenge"" competition for both middle and high school students at The Works Museum in Licking County, Ohio.  He has also established a joint program between Denison University, The Works and The Ohio State University Newark branch to bring local 10-12 year-olds and their parents onto campuses for STEM lectures and laboratory demonstrations.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the discovery and development of fundamentally new properties and chemistries in an emerging class of supramolecular organic materials, aromatic charge-transfer liquid crystals (ACT-LCs).  Specifically, studies to advance the emergence of optoelectronic functional properties, material tunability, and controlled molecular assembly in new ACT-LCs are conducted through three main objectives.  The first objective concentrates on the systematic design, synthesis, and combination/assembly of a series of aromatic molecules in a modular fashion to better understand and predict relationships between component structure and ACT-LC bulk properties including charge-transfer (CT) persistence, extended CT absorption range (NIR), and resolution of laser-writable optical dichroism.  In the second objective, aromatic components having a large molecular dipole are incorporated into ACT-LCs to align orthogonal materials for field-effect applications and enhanced writable resolution.  In the last objective, emerging ACT-LCs are explored as organic media for new methods of optical data storage and information encryption.

The mechanism in which proteins process signal information is called allosteric communication. While the study of allosteric communication has been underway for more than four decades, critical details of these fundamental processes are still poorly understood. This gap in knowledge prevents scientists and engineers from designing new proteins with custom-built communication abilities. Accordingly, the focus of the current project is to elucidate the rules that will enable scientists to build allosteric communication in a family of transcription factors that process a broad range of signals. This research will expand the scientific communities understanding of allosteric communication and enable the development of new tools that can be used to benefit society (e.g., new and less expensive process controls for bio-industrial applications, and systems for use in personalized medicine). Moreover, this project will involve the training and education of the next generation of scientists, specifically Ph.D. level graduate students.<br/>    <br/>Protein allostery is a vitally important protein function that has proven to be a vexing problem to understand at the molecular level. Allosteric communication is a hallmark of many transcription factors used to control gene expression and have enabled synthetic biologist to reprogram cells. The specific goal of this research is to leverage the basic structure and function relationship of the lactose repressor (LacI) to systematically map and engineer alternate allosteric communication, in several LacI/GalR homologues. Answering the fundamental question of whether allostery in the broader LacI/GalR family has been evolved to be controlled by a set of conserved residues or whether the protein is plastic and predisposed to allostery across different residue sequences will ultimately give insights into allosteric structure-function relationships and aid in the engineering of novel transcription factors. Mapping allostery and determining the evolutionary origin, links, and mechanism by which allostery is conferred in the LacI/GalR family will provide crucial knowledge into how other proteins may be designed to exhibit allostery and how to control and modulate allostery in existing systems. Upon completion, this study will enable scientist to test assertions with regard to the origin and molecular mechanics of alternate allosteric communication via the development of design rules for specific allosteric operations. In turn this algorithm will produce novel LacI/GalR-based transcription factors for use in a broad range of biotechnological applications.

Past variations in the abundance of water in this region can be documented from study of ancient lake basins there. This project will produce a reconstruction of water availability, vegetation, and moisture sources in the Searles and Death Valley basins of the southwestern U.S. spanning the last 150,000 years. The researchers will use shoreline deposits from each basin to constrain ancient lake levels. Sediment core records from the centers of each basin will provide paleoclimate information that spans both wet and dry periods.  Plant wax preserved in the cores will provide insight into past vegetation changes that reflect variations in moisture sources. Radiometric dating of sediments will give precise ages of environmental changes in the ancient lakes. Lake shoreline ages will be used to interpret past lake volumes in the Searles and Death Valley basins. Collectively, this information will be used to model past river flow and water budgets. This work will also lay the foundation for future development of a continuous 3.2 million-year sediment record from the Searles basin, including past warm periods.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students at 5 institutions. Binghamton University participants will lead field tours to visitors to Death Valley National Park through a partnership with the Death Valley Natural History Association. Outreach at the University of Southern California will involve collaboration with the La Brea Tar Pits Museum and will focus on teaching 4th grade visitors how Pleistocene lakes relate to the museum fossil fauna of the same age. The MIT group will incorporate project findings into climate-themed outreach at the Cambridge Science Festival, Girls' Day at the MIT Museum, and at the New England Aquarium. Researchers from SUNY College at Oswego and Keystone College will incorporate research outcomes into paleoclimate and sustainability courses that reach hundreds of students per year.<br/><br/>The southwestern U.S. is a water-stressed region that is projected to experience declining water availability over the coming century. Model projections show substantial disagreement in the regional circulation responses to projected emissions scenarios, with divergent predictions of the magnitude and spatial fingerprint of future drying. Lake records have the potential to offer detailed reconstructions of the hydrological, atmospheric, and vegetation responses to a wide range of forcings and to provide future opportunities to benchmark model performance. Lake records from the Searles and Death Valley basins in southern California show dramatic lake level and vegetation changes over the last 150 kyr, reflecting in part large changes in river flow from the societally-important Owens River system. These records require new analyses to improve imprecise chronologies and refine lake level reconstructions and correlations from these neighboring basins. This project is a multi-faceted reconstruction of past hydrologic and vegetation changes spanning the last 150 kyr in the Searles and Death Valley basins. The researchers will use tufa and other nearshore deposits to constrain lake levels in both basins, and existing and new measurements from a recently collected core, SLAPP-SRLS17 from Searles basin, and core DV93-1, Death Valley, to provide continuous multi-proxy records. Sedimentary structures and textures, evaporite mineralogy and facies, siliciclastic grain size changes, and rock magnetic variations in cores will be used with shoreline constraints to model past hydrologic and lake chemistry changes in Searles basin, providing quantitative constraints on past river inflows and precipitation-evaporation balance. Plant wax delta13C and pollen will provide insight into past vegetation changes, and plant wax deltaD will be used to track changes in moisture source and water vapor history. In both basins, U/Th dating will be used to provide precise age models, with support from 14C and paleomagnetic measurements in Searles Lake deposits. Paleointensity variability and evidence for magnetic field excursions will provide an independent method for dating the SLAPP-SRLS17 core. Together, the two basins will provide replicated, well-dated hydrological and vegetation records using independent approaches to test interpretations of the cave oxygen isotope records from nearby Devils Hole and Leviathan Caves to the northeast. These records will provide a quantitative estimate of the volumetric changes in water storage and the magnitude of precipitation isotopic shifts to better determine atmospheric circulation changes and the resulting hydrologic implications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly in many applications in environmental sciences and geosciences, one is concerned with the modeling of flow and transport in porous media containing fractures and faults. There the spatial and temporal scales associated with various geological layers and fractures or different physical processes may vary with several orders of magnitude. The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of numerical techniques for fractured porous medium applications by designing and analyzing novel computational methods based on parallel global-in-time domain decomposition. These methods facilitate the coupling of different models and enable the use of different time step sizes and spatial mesh sizes in different regions of the computational domain. Thus the proposed methods can be used as an efficient and accurate computational tool for solving large-scale, strongly heterogeneous, coupled evolution partial differential equations arising from diverse application fields such as groundwater flow and contaminant transport, hydraulic fracture, geological disposal of nuclear waste and geological carbon sequestration. The numerical simulations carried out in this project would also provide new insights to the understanding of the long-term behavior and performance of geological nuclear waste repositories. Graduate students will be involved in this project and will be offered a great opportunity to participate in an interdisciplinary research environment.<br/><br/>Although domain decomposition methods have been well studied for many scientific and engineering problems, no enough attention and work have been devoted to fractured porous medium applications with local time stepping. This project focuses on the design and analysis of efficient global-in-time domain decomposition methods for reduced fracture models, in which the fractures are treated as manifolds of one dimension less than the medium. Three model problems will be considered: the linear transport problem, the multiphysics flow and the incompressible two-phase flow, respectively. The developed methods are based on either physical transmission conditions or optimized transmission conditions on the space-time interface fractures; the latter conditions involve more general transmission operators, motivated by the physics of the underlying problem, with some coefficients that can be optimized to improve the convergence rates of the iterations. Importantly, the proposed methods make possible the use of different time step sizes and spatial grids in the interface fractures and in the surrounding medium. The PI will also study the application of the proposed methods to numerical simulation and investigation of fluid flow and contaminant transport in fractured porous media arising from the framework of geological nuclear waste disposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the central parts of the experimental program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the study of possible collective and correlated behavior in heavy ion collisions as well as proton-ion collisions at high energy. The latter are particularly interesting, since understanding collectivity may allow for progress in understanding the structure of the proton.

Danheiser of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In this research program, Professor Danheiser and his students are developing new methods for the chemical synthesis of cyclic organic molecules that are incorporated in the chemical structures of numerous biologically-important compounds. The development of highly efficient methods for the synthesis of these molecules has great value in providing improved access to compounds with important applications in medicine, materials chemistry, agriculture and electronics. The goal of this research program is the development of new synthetic strategies with the power to dramatically streamline the synthesis of these classes of compounds. The utility of these new methods is being demonstrated by their application to the synthesis of several naturally-occurring compounds that have activity as antitumor agents, but which are not available in large quantities from their sources in nature. The graduate students supported under this grant serve as coordinators for the MIT Outreach Program, which each year visits about 25 high schools in the New England region providing presentations on chemistry and careers in science. Approximately 1,200-1,500 high school students attend these presentations each year, with up to 50% of the students being members of underrepresented minority groups.  Dr. Danheiser is also a recognized leader in chemical safety.<br/><br/>This research advances the ability of chemists to develop efficient syntheses of several important classes of organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic molecules and heterocyclic systems such as indoles and pyridines. The methods under investigation involve mechanistically novel transformations.  These studies are furthering the understanding of the chemistry of unusual reactive species such as strained cyclic allenes and alkynes, vinylketenes, vinylallenes, and several other classes of highly unsaturated conjugated molecules. From the perspective of sustainability, the methodology under development has several attractive features. Most of the methods are highly atom economical, i.e., all of the atoms of the reactants are incorporated in the products, minimizing the generation of chemical waste. In addition, most of the new cycloadditions are triggered simply by heat or light, avoiding the need for even catalytic amounts of reagents (especially heavy metal catalysts). Synthesis is often described as the ""enabling technology"" of chemistry. The synthetic methods provide researchers in both academia and industry with new tools to design and make heterocyclic compounds with applications in medicine, agriculture, electronics, and other areas. The graduate students supported under this program receive training to develop their skills as synthetic chemists, in scientific ethics, and in developing their oral and written communication skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kaiser of the University of Hawaii at Manoa is exploring chemical reactions between a simple molecule containing one silicon and one hydrogen atom (SiH, formal name ""silylidyne"")  with other molecules such as water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3).   Similar reactions between simple carbon molecules and H2O, H2S and NH3 are well-studied, but little is known about the corresponding silicon reactions.   The chemistry of carbon and silicon are similar in many ways, even to the point that some scientists have asked the question, ""why is life on Earth based on the element carbon, and not silicon?""   Professor Kaiser's research is exploring the differences in chemical reactivity of molecules containing silicon and carbon, and is providing insights into chemical reactions in general.  This research is also broad implications and directly contributes to an ongoing effort by astrochemists and astrobiologists to connect the chemistry of space to the birth of stars, the formation of planets, and the evolution of life. More broadly, this project impacts society through the dissemination of its research results, through outreach activities to researchers, college students, and high school teachers via interdisciplinary symposia, by broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities, and by relaying the project's latest breakthroughs directly to educators enabling them to incorporate research activities into classroom curricula.<br/><br/>By conducting state-of-the-art crossed molecular beam experiments of ground state silylidyne radicals (SiH) with prototype mononuclear main group (IV - VI) hydrides and combining these results with ab initio and quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations in collaboration with Prof. Martin Head-Gordon (UC Berkeley), the proposed investigations explore the hitherto elusive chemical dynamics of silicon-bearing systems and untangle the formation of exotic dinuclear silicon-carrying molecules, of which many have only been predicted to exist theoretically. The project is advancing the fundamental understanding of the chemical bonding of silicon-based molecules, transform the knowledge of the unimolecular decomposition of chemically activated silicon-bearing reactive intermediates and evaluate the processes which control them, establish predictive concepts of non-adiabatic reaction dynamics in silicon-bearing molecular systems, and illuminate the perception of isovalency on the molecular level by comparing the reaction dynamics of the silylidyne radical (SiH) with those of the isovalent methylidyne (CH) systems. Participating graduate and undergraduate students are being trained in cutting-edge laboratory techniques (reactive scattering experiments, ultra-high vacuum setups, laser techniques) along with data analysis and dissemination of their research results in peer-reviewed journals. The PI's group also plans an annual one-week National Summer Teacher Workshop, aimed at teachers from local and mainland high schools, that emphasizes hands-on laboratory activities in astrochemistry and how the results from fundamental research in gas phase chemistry (reaction mechanisms, chemical dynamics) are applied to better understand the chemistry occurring in the solar system (comets, meteorites, planets and moons) and interstellar medium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of compounds have a variety of applications in diverse settings including computing and photonic materials. This research program is dedicated to understanding how these photochromic compounds (and ultimately materials) interact with light to generate color changes. Most of the known photochromic compounds operate through a light-triggered molecular rearrangement that occurs on an ultrafast timescale (picosecond). There are many unanswered questions regarding how molecules convert light energy into potential energy to initiate molecular rearrangement. A new aspect of this research program is the development of new optical experimental techniques to monitor structural and magnetic changes in molecules on very short timescales.

He has a particular interest in supporting Native American students, Hispanic students, and women in their career development.  The project provides experience in the design of instrumentation to address questions at the interface between chemistry and physics. The multidisciplinary nature of the project demand that the student researchers be aware of literature contributions in disparate research areas.<br/><br/>This research award in the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program within the Division of Chemistry at NSF supports the research efforts of Professor Jeffrey Rack at University of New Mexico to investigate a new class of transition metal complexes which change structure and color when exposed to solar radiation (light). These studies focus on discovering the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the action of this unique family of chromophores that utilize light to break and make bonds on a very fast timescale. The mode of action in these complexes is an excited state isomerization of the bound sulfoxide ligand. In addition, two new instrumental techniques are introduced. First, Professor Rack is studying the development of a time-resolved circular dichroism to monitor chirality changes, not only in transition metal sulfoxide complexes, but also in chiral sulfoxide compounds.

The project focuses on the ductile fault zone associated with the Raft River metamorphic core complex in Utah, in order to constrain both the source and the amount of fluid during faulting. The study incorporates geologic mapping in the field, analyses of mineral structures, chemical analyses, and analyses to determine the timing of movement along the fault. The project has the potential to tie analytic data to specific fluid sources and better constrain fluid flow at a crustal-scale. This project is led by an early career faculty member and includes Masters-level graduate and undergraduate students. First-generation and minority college students at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette are also involved. The project incorporates an outreach effort to support K-12 education in rural western North Carolina that includes geologic time resources developed by undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve the understanding of fluid-rock interaction in detachment shear zones associated with metamorphic core complexes. Hydrous metamorphic minerals record the presence of meteoric fluids at great depths within the crust. Despite the clear record of meteoric fluids down to mid- to lower-crustal depths, many chemical and petrologic inconsistencies remain. During orogenic collapse, the upper crust thins by brittle normal faulting while the ductile lower crust flows laterally. Localization of extension eventually leads to the formation of a detachment shear zone and metamorphic core complex. Ductile extension in the lower crust is characterized by high heat fluxes, granitic intrusion, and migmatitic gneiss domes, associated with metamorphic/magmatic fluids. During exhumation, there is competition between two fluid reservoirs (magmatic/metamorphic and meteoric water from surface sources). This project uses hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope data as tracers of fluid source and fluid-rock exchange to provide constraints on fluid-rock interaction during continental extension. Isotopic data is linked to specific fluid sources to better constrain the hydrology of crustal-scale fluid flow, in order to bridge the gap between experimentally-derived rock strengths, and field observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wave propagation through biological tissue is a fundamental physical process upon which numerous diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are based. Well-established diagnostic techniques include ultrasound imaging based upon high-frequency sound waves or magnetic resonance imaging based upon radio waves. A new window to investigate biological tissue is the use of mechanical shear waves that travel faster through stiff tissue and slower through soft tissue. By use of shear waves it is possible to effectively carry out palpation of internal organs otherwise accessible only by surgery. However, the propagation of shear waves in biological tissue is not well understood due to the large variability in wave velocity through different tissue types, much larger than that of sound waves. This can lead to counterintuitive effects such as formation of a concussion far from the immediate area of a head blow due to focusing of shear waves reflected by the cranium. Conversely, the large variability in shear wave velocity can be leveraged to carry out detailed investigations of biological tissue outside the capabilities of other diagnostic techniques. To enable such diagnostics there is a need to obtain a fundamental understanding of the relationship between tissue structure and shear wave propagation, as investigated in this project. Project activities include mentoring of graduate student and postdoctoral participants, integration of research results into data-driven modeling courses for undergraduates, as well as presentation of information theory to the general public through outreach activities at the Morehead Planetarium and University of North Carolina Science Days.<br/><br/>Strain-stiffening, probably due to microscopic reorganization of filamentary structures in cells and the extracellular matrix, leads to the formation of shear shock waves induced by excitation amplitudes as low as 1% strain. The subsequent wavefront steepening can readily surpass 7% strain leading to tissue injury. The shear modulus can vary by five orders of magnitude in different tissue types and is close to zero in liquid-filled interstitia that exhibit random placement in organs such as the brain. Bulk-homogenized viscoelastic models with a discrete spectrum are inapplicable outside their calibration domain and are not linked by physical principles to the specific tissue.  This study pursues a combined experimental-theoretical approach to development of scale-dependent homogenized models of shear wave propagation in highly heterogeneous biological tissue. High-resolution, 1024 channel measurements at 10 kHz and 1 micrometer resolution are used to construct detailed images of shear wave propagation through biological tissue and phantoms. A multiple-scale computational model is constructed that uses information-theoretic concepts such as mutual information to link the different simulation levels, offering a new perspective on and development of traditional adaptive mesh and model refinement. Results from this investigation will be generally applicable to nonlinear, multiscale stochastic systems that do not exhibit scale separation. Both experimental results and computational code will be available through literate programming and reproducible research practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most commercial solid catalysts used today consist of metal particles supported on high surface area support materials. Improvements in these catalysts are needed to further improve their efficiency. Successful research in this area results in lower energy consumption and reduced environmental impact of many chemical processes. One approach to this goal is through control of the interfaces between the metal particles and the support materials. In this project, Dr. Nikolla (Wayne State University) and Dr. Medlin (University of Colorado) are developing an understanding these metal/support interfaces with the objective of discovering more active and efficient catalysts. Dr. Nikolla and Dr. Medlin actively engage in outreach activities related to the education of young students, especially those from underrepresented groups. For example, they are developing workshops for underrepresented K-12 female students to enhance their understanding and desire in pursuing higher education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.

They are synthesizing controlled metal oxide-encapsulated metal nanoparticles (i.e., M@MO structures) with systematic variations in structure and composition of both the metal and metal oxide components.  The research team correlates these synthetic variations to the surface chemical properties and catalyst performance. Fundamental insights from experimental model catalysts coupled with advanced characterization and computational studies on inverted catalyst systems are being used to advance the understanding of interfacial chemistry. The encapsulated catalyst systems are also being investigated as a platform for controlling the near-surface environment around the reactive interface through functionalization of the oxide pores with organic ligands.

Recent research on the Terminal Classic in the Maya area shows that Maya communities were differentially affected by collapse processes and their responses were variable, including cases of disruption and abandonment, short flourishment, and resilience and transformation. Ortiz's research will focus on the detection of migration from a potential receiving end, a theme that has been addressed in other worldwide ancient migration cases but that has been minimally tracked in other Maya sub-regions. Questions about the effects of the Maya collapse, including the impact of lowland population movements, have been less frequently addressed for the highlands. The results of this research will contribute to the growing discussion on how social identity, specifically of the ancient Maya, intersects with technology, and how migrants can be detected in the archaeological record. Ortiz's work seeks to make a positive impact on the indigenous Qeqchi Maya living near the site by providing important culture-historical information from their own cultural past and promoting collaborative participation, re-ownership, and safekeeping of local cultural heritage. The results of the project seek to publicly discuss the myriad ways that Maya communities experienced the Maya collapse by contesting popular and catastrophic beliefs of this social process.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Mr. Ortiz will conduct archaeological research at Kixpek, Guatemala. This ancient settlement is located at the northern edge of the highlands immediately south of the lowlands region. Funerary pottery found at the site indicates a Late Classic to Early Postclassic occupation (AD 600-1200), showing that the community lived through the Classic Maya collapse. The site of Kixpek on the Chixoy drainage presents an opportunity to examine how a highland community experienced social processes that happened during and after the Terminal Classic. Did migrants relocate among their neighbors at the northern highlands and what evidence of this migration is available at this region? Did highland ceramic technologies persist or change with the potential introduction of new social groups after the Maya collapse? Ortiz will conduct excavations in Group B and presumed habitation areas surrounding the main plaza in order to obtain pottery samples from pre- and post-Maya collapse periods of occupation. Laboratory analysis will include detailed ceramic analysis by stylistic and technological attributes through macroscopic and microscopic techniques for pottery classification. Ortiz will evaluate the continuities and changes in technological systems, specifically in pottery, obsidian, and burial practices at Kixpek, amidst the potential relocation of people after the Terminal Classic period.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Amines are organic compounds derived from ammonia by replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms by organic groups.  Amines are very common in biology such as in amino acids and neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine.   The goal of this research is to convert simple amines into other, more valuable or useful amines. To solve this challenge, Professor Ge and his students are using ""directing groups"" that attach reversibly to the amine group and force the reaction to occur on a specific (desired) site. The summer undergraduate research program attracts college students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, to the STEM areas, training potential future leaders in scientific research.  The engagement of high school teachers provides an active learning environment and enables them to deliver in-depth knowledge of key scientific ideas and practices to their classes. This educational effort, in turn, triggers high school students' curiosity, inspires their interest in chemistry, and attracts more high school students into the STEM areas.<br/><br/>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Haibo Ge of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Professor Ge is developing new methods to construct carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. This reaction chemistry allows for various common organic compounds to be readily accessed in an efficient manner via a C-H bond functionalization process.  It also enables rapid late-stage functionalization (LSF) of complex organic molecules. When compared to conventional cross-coupling reactions, the C-H functionalization process does not require pre-functionalized starting materials and can avoid the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents, making it more environmentally and economically beneficial. The new type of C-H functionalization reactions allows for the use of readily-available organic molecules as starting materials, and thus improves the potential applications of the process. The principal goal of the project is to develop novel transition metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions in order to provide powerful, valuable, and straightforward synthetic approaches to access common organic frameworks. A variety of medically important (hetero)cyclic skeletons are expected to be efficiently accessed from readily-available aliphatic amines and aldehydes via this strategy. The asymmetric functionalization of these strong sp3 C-H bonds is also designed with the use of chiral catalysts. The project focuses primarily on synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry with potential integration of computational and medicinal chemistry. Thus, the project is well-positioned for the education and training of all levels of scientists.

There is a large and rich literature on the relationship between Islam and constitutionalism, and an older historical literature on the central place of Canon law in the Western legal tradition. Writing on Buddhist law is scarce in general, and especially so with regard to constitutional thought. This is particularly problematic when Buddhist actors are playing an important role in the constitutional politics of many countries. To date, policy analysis and scholarship has not fully grappled with the growing importance of Buddhist actors and institutions on the practice, conceptualization and formation of constitutional law. This workshop and its outputs will therefore help inform policy understandings of the interaction of these two major forces in years to come. <br/><br/>This workshop will produce publications and collaborations, supporting new researchers and identifying a clear research agenda for studying Buddhism and public law both within the academy and the policy community. Co-chaired by two scholars with complementary training and expertise--in political and comparative approaches to constitutional law and historical and social scientific study of Buddhism, respectively--it will consist of six panels, bringing together scholars of law and socio-legal studies with scholars of politics, history and religion, including graduate students and early-career scholars. Panelists will produce original research on Buddhism and constitutional law in particular Asian jurisdictions, while also reflecting from comparative perspectives, including international law, American and Asian constitutional law, and other traditions of religious law (Hindu law, Islamic law, Canon law).  One panel will place contemporary constitutional practice and politics in a longer span of pre-nineteenth-century Asian history, grounding discussions of the constitutional present in the region's rich historical settings.

Years of observations at persistently erupting volcanoes like Kilauea (Hawaii) have produced a sophisticated understanding of fluidal, fast-moving basaltic lava flows; however, a similar level of understanding is absent for other types of lava. Eruptions of highly viscous, slow-flowing silicic lavas are common in the geological record but are infrequent at human timescales, and therefore poorly understood. Most of our understanding of silicic lava flow comes from studies of ancient lavas coupled with simulations using analogous, viscous materials like corn syrup. Analog models and analogous geological materials like ice (glaciers) and mud (mudflows) predict that silicic lavas will flow away from the volcanic vent and therefore, stretch and extend. This should be a primarily brittle process akin to the formation of crevasses on glaciers. However, studies of ancient lavas report compression and thickening of silicic lavas through ductile folding of the lava's upper surface. The style of deformation is important in constraining the internal temperature and gas content of the lava as brittle fracturing will potentially release over-pressured gas and lava, causing explosive eruptions throughout the duration of the lava's advance. Conversely, if lavas do indeed fold then they must flow much faster than anticipated and will advance down the volcano's flanks rapidly, endangering downslope communities. The results will be applicable to future eruptions of silicic lavas in eastern California, Oregon, at Yellowstone National Park, and elsewhere around the world. Several graduate students will be supported with this award, and will gain important experience in both field and modeling techniques.<br/><br/>Observations at several silicic lavas and review of literature challenge the existing interpretation of silicic lava flows being folded during ductile flow. Silicic lavas at Medicine Lake and Newberry volcanoes in the Cascade volcanic chain of the western United States will be focus of the study. Lavas will be mapped to understand the structural evolution of their upper surfaces, paying attention to the presence or absence of folds and other structures associated with compression. If, as expected, structures are dominantly extensional in nature, for example fractures and crevasses, models associated with folding and compression will be revised. A small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) will be used to generate high-resolution maps of accessible parts of the upper surfaces and to generate three-dimensional models of the structures that can measured further in virtual reality. Structures such as folds and crevasses, and rock types will be mapped on the new sUAS base to and establish the types, orientations and magnitudes of deformation. The entire upper surfaces of the lavas will be mapped using LiDAR and satellite imagery to examine the distribution of the structures and deformation over larger areas, and to fill-in gaps between more detailed mapping. Together these data will produce a comprehensive structural model that describes the evolving flow of silicic lava from the vent to the margins, and integrates understanding of ancient lavas from analog models and fundamental theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past variations in the abundance of water in this region can be documented from study of ancient lake basins there. This project will produce a reconstruction of water availability, vegetation, and moisture sources in the Searles and Death Valley basins of the southwestern U.S. spanning the last 150,000 years. The researchers will use shoreline deposits from each basin to constrain ancient lake levels. Sediment core records from the centers of each basin will provide paleoclimate information that spans both wet and dry periods.  Plant wax preserved in the cores will provide insight into past vegetation changes that reflect variations in moisture sources. Radiometric dating of sediments will give precise ages of environmental changes in the ancient lakes. Lake shoreline ages will be used to interpret past lake volumes in the Searles and Death Valley basins. Collectively, this information will be used to model past river flow and water budgets. This work will also lay the foundation for future development of a continuous 3.2 million-year sediment record from the Searles basin, including past warm periods.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students at 5 institutions. Binghamton University participants will lead field tours to visitors to Death Valley National Park through a partnership with the Death Valley Natural History Association. Outreach at the University of Southern California will involve collaboration with the La Brea Tar Pits Museum and will focus on teaching 4th grade visitors how Pleistocene lakes relate to the museum fossil fauna of the same age. The MIT group will incorporate project findings into climate-themed outreach at the Cambridge Science Festival, Girls' Day at the MIT Museum, and at the New England Aquarium. Researchers from SUNY College at Oswego and Keystone College will incorporate research outcomes into paleoclimate and sustainability courses that reach hundreds of students per year.<br/><br/>The southwestern U.S. is a water-stressed region that is projected to experience declining water availability over the coming century. Model projections show substantial disagreement in the regional circulation responses to projected emissions scenarios, with divergent predictions of the magnitude and spatial fingerprint of future drying. Lake records have the potential to offer detailed reconstructions of the hydrological, atmospheric, and vegetation responses to a wide range of forcings and to provide future opportunities to benchmark model performance. Lake records from the Searles and Death Valley basins in southern California show dramatic lake level and vegetation changes over the last 150 kyr, reflecting in part large changes in river flow from the societally-important Owens River system. These records require new analyses to improve imprecise chronologies and refine lake level reconstructions and correlations from these neighboring basins. This project is a multi-faceted reconstruction of past hydrologic and vegetation changes spanning the last 150 kyr in the Searles and Death Valley basins. The researchers will use tufa and other nearshore deposits to constrain lake levels in both basins, and existing and new measurements from a recently collected core, SLAPP-SRLS17 from Searles basin, and core DV93-1, Death Valley, to provide continuous multi-proxy records. Sedimentary structures and textures, evaporite mineralogy and facies, siliciclastic grain size changes, and rock magnetic variations in cores will be used with shoreline constraints to model past hydrologic and lake chemistry changes in Searles basin, providing quantitative constraints on past river inflows and precipitation-evaporation balance. Plant wax delta13C and pollen will provide insight into past vegetation changes, and plant wax deltaD will be used to track changes in moisture source and water vapor history. In both basins, U/Th dating will be used to provide precise age models, with support from 14C and paleomagnetic measurements in Searles Lake deposits. Paleointensity variability and evidence for magnetic field excursions will provide an independent method for dating the SLAPP-SRLS17 core.

Membranes are very thin insulators, so this process is like charging a capacitor.  Once charged, the capacitor discharges by driving the biosynthesis of stable energetic molecules or fuels.  All life on earth depends on this process.  This research will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which photosynthetic reaction centers harvest and store solar energy, and the development of model membrane assemblies that mimic natural biological membranes and their interactions.  This project will modulate the properties of key amino acids near to the reactive chromophores in the RC to systematically understand why electrons take the pathway they do and by what precise mechanism.   A significant part of this work involves the development of new experimental and theoretical methods that will have a broad impact in other areas of science and technology. This research program will continue to support the development of a generation of young scientists with diverse backgrounds, primarily graduate students, who go on to productive careers at the interface of the physical sciences and biology, biotechnology, and energy-related science.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two related topics; the mechanism of charge separation in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers, and the development of novel methods to assemble and image model membrane architectures. This project will implement site specific modification of functionally important amino acids with non-canonical amino acids and the introduction of nitrile spectator probes for electron transfer and membrane potential. This project will continue development of a ""membrane interferometer"", designed for simultaneous optical and electrical measurements on single integral membrane proteins such as ion channels, and develop novel methods to measure lipid diffusion on sub-micron sized membranes to explore the effects of curvature on diffusion.

The research will test whether soil formation over hundreds to thousands of years, including accumulation of organic matter and fine dust, can significantly reduce the susceptibility of certain parts of these landscapes to wind and water erosion. The results will be important for predicting patterns of future accelerated erosion and dune activation, with major practical implications, since the level tablelands of the loess landscapes are prime agricultural land and the dunes are important rangeland and key recharge areas for the Ogallala Aquifer. Increased erosion could also affect sediment input to streams and release carbon stored in buried and surface soils in these landscapes. The project will provide research training to a diverse group of students and will include development of effective ways to communicate the results to local communities and other stakeholders.<br/><br/>The project will test hypotheses on the interactions between geomorphic processes and soil formation in the evolution of loess tablelands and adjacent dune fields. The hypotheses propose that aeolian processes (deflation, slow loess accumulation, and dune activity) influence spatial patterns of soil formation and organic carbon accumulation, which in turn influence thresholds for wind and water erosion through effects on vegetation resilience and mechanical strength. Study sites will be selected to allow comparison of soil and sediment properties related to nutrient and water availability and shear strength on tableland summits and adjacent slopes with varying soil development and recent loess accumulation, and on dunes with varying soil development.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research will investigate the spread of antibiotic resistance, which is a rising threat to society, affecting both low-and high-income countries alike. While the global spread of antibiotic resistance is readily observed, the transfer of antibiotic resistance at the household scale is not well understood. The Fellow will explore how antibiotic resistance genes propagate between humans, animals, and the environment in low-and middle-income countries at the household level. This project will identify the most important environmentally-mediated pathways for the transfer of antibiotic resistance between hosts. The knowledge obtained from understanding how antibiotic resistance spreads can be used to better devise policy, engineering controls, and suggest behavior to combat antimicrobial resistance. To increase minority participation in the biological sciences, the Fellow will incorporate antibiotic resistance and genomics in a teaching module to be used in local community colleges in Boston. The goal of this module is to expose students to research and introduce them to scientific challenges that face our society today. <br/><br/>Antibiotic resistance can spread through two main mechanisms: propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. This research aims to characterize both mechanisms of resistance spread in environmental transmission pathways (between humans, water, animals, soil) using recently developed metagenomic tools. Long and short read sequencing will be used to obtain strain-level information on antibiotic resistant bacteria. Additionally, complimentary methods (qPCR) will be used to identify key reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes by quantifying the abundance of genes in different household samples (humans, animals, water, soil). Beyond this research, the Fellow will develop and implement a teaching module for community colleges centered around sequencing. Not only will community college students learn about the latest sequencing techniques, but also the data they collect will directly contribute to a crowd-sourced database that maps antibiotic resistance in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This project will determine how adaptation to high altitude affects function of the placenta. Biologists study altitude adaptation to understand how animals evolve under environmental challenges. At high altitude, there is less oxygen available, and lower oxygen can cause problems for animal health. For example, high altitude slows the growth of babies during pregnancy. However, animals that have adapted to altitude have babies that grow at normal rates. One reason pregnancy might be protected in adapted animals is because their placentas, which control growth of the baby, have evolved some special functions. The fellow's research will identify the changes to placental function that protect offspring growth by comparing development of the placenta among altitude-adapted and non-adapted populations of mice. This research will help us understand basic function of the placenta and how the placenta evolves. The fellow will also establish a mentor training program to teach mentoring skills to graduate students and other early-career scientists.<br/><br/>The fellow will use three populations of mice to generate gestational timelines of placental development, gene expression (TagSeq), and fetal development in mothers gestating under normoxia or simulated-hypobaric hypoxia. The fellow will compare outcome measures among deer mice derived from lowland- and highland-resident populations and an outbred house mouse strain. Comparing placental structure and gene expression among populations gestating under different hypoxia regimes will allow the fellow to identify which hypoxia-dependent regulatory systems in the placenta are conserved among all populations which display signatures of adaptation. The fellow will also connect regulatory network modulation in the placenta to fetal and maternal health to determine how altitude adaptation has altered regulatory systems to preserve offspring survival. As part of this project, the fellow will receive training in high-throughput sequencing and functional genomics analyses.

This is achieved by fabricating novel media in which energy, which propagates as waves, interacts with engineered microfeatures. A current example of a novel, naturally occurring, medium of intense interest is graphene a one-atom thick mono-layer of carbon atoms, arranged in-plane in a honeycomb structure, extending to the macro-scale. Graphene is the most conductive substance known at room temperature (electronically and thermally). This material has been at a center of a revolution in Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, known as the Two-Dimensional Material. Many of the novel phenomena observed in graphene relate to general mathematical properties of waves in media with novel symmetry, and hence physicists and engineers have engineered and investigated materials with similar general properties, dubbed ""artificial graphene,"" with a view on applications to optics, communications, information storage and computing. PI Weinstein will study a range of problems in fundamental and applied mathematics related to the existence, stability and transport properties of waves in such novel media, with honeycomb structures as a paradigm for 2D materials, as well as questions concerning the dynamics of waves in nonlinear systems. This work is firmly aligned with Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas.

The conical singularities (Dirac points) of the dispersion surfaces of graphene are at the core of its remarkable electron mobility, and the topological properties of its band structure properties give information about the types of energy-transport can occur when graphene is interfaced with free-space or another material. Thus, it is through a convergence notion from Analysis, PDE and Topology that one can make process understanding these novel materials and their artificial analogues.<br/>    (B) This research is part of the PI's long-standing research program in nonlinear waves, which now emphasizes i) coherent structure propagation in discrete nonlinear dispersive systems and ii) the nonlinear PDE dynamics of coherent structures with infinitely many internal degrees of freedom, as exemplified by the nonlinear oscillations of a bubble in the fluid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limited or variable shore ice cover results in enhanced storm-induced coastal erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure. The dynamics of how reduced ice cover influences coastal evolution is poorly understood which inhibits accurate forecasting of future coastal response in cold climates. This work aims to improve our fundamental understanding of how sediment interacts with shore ice as well as the resulting coastal landscape change. The first part of the project will involve laboratory experiments aimed at studying the physics of sediment and ice interactions. The second part of the project will gather field measurements that use the laboratory measurements as a basis to investigate how cold climate coastlines naturally respond to the shore ice. This study will result in a model that will help explain how reduced and variable winter shore ice cover alters the coastal landscape, which will help coastal managers proactively plan for future climate change impacts. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students who will be recruited from groups underrepresented in the STEM fields.  Public educational resources will be delivered to inner-city schools through partnership with Chicago Public Schools and will be shared nationally through The Scientific Research and Education Network (www.sciren.org), which is a science education non-profit founded by the PI.<br/><br/>Accurate modeling of coastal evolution in cold climates is hindered by a limited understanding of the processes and responses associated with winter shore ice. This study will utilize unoccupied aerial and aquatic systems through a combined field and laboratory approach to test the hypothesis that variable ice cover is more erosive than consistent ice cover. This approach will yield the most comprehensive understanding to date of the morphodynamics of nearshore ice. Laboratory experiments in a frozen wave tank and ring shear apparatus will be used to constrain the forces required to entrain sediment within ice as well as the fundamental processes associated with transporting sediment-laden ice. Field investigations will be used to validate laboratory experiments as well as to describe the geomorphic processes and responses associated with shore ice. We will isolate the primary conditions facilitating sediment transport and shoreface geomorphic change during winter and resolve how the shoreface responds to these processes, which will provide the basis for models to include coastal evolution in cold temperature climates. The final result of this proposed study will be a conceptual model and set of empirically derived equations generated from the field and laboratory measurements that describe how shore ice drives sediment transport. This knowledge will be shared with practitioners through Great Lakes Coastal Zone Management Programs, local and regional stakeholder groups, and federal agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on the ductile fault zone associated with the Raft River metamorphic core complex in Utah, in order to constrain both the source and the amount of fluid during faulting. The study incorporates geologic mapping in the field, analyses of mineral structures, chemical analyses, and analyses to determine the timing of movement along the fault. The project has the potential to tie analytic data to specific fluid sources and better constrain fluid flow at a crustal-scale. This project is led by an early career faculty member and includes Masters-level graduate and undergraduate students. First-generation and minority college students at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette are also involved. The project incorporates an outreach effort to support K-12 education in rural western North Carolina that includes geologic time resources developed by undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve the understanding of fluid-rock interaction in detachment shear zones associated with metamorphic core complexes. Hydrous metamorphic minerals record the presence of meteoric fluids at great depths within the crust. Despite the clear record of meteoric fluids down to mid- to lower-crustal depths, many chemical and petrologic inconsistencies remain. During orogenic collapse, the upper crust thins by brittle normal faulting while the ductile lower crust flows laterally. Localization of extension eventually leads to the formation of a detachment shear zone and metamorphic core complex. Ductile extension in the lower crust is characterized by high heat fluxes, granitic intrusion, and migmatitic gneiss domes, associated with metamorphic/magmatic fluids. During exhumation, there is competition between two fluid reservoirs (magmatic/metamorphic and meteoric water from surface sources). This project uses hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope data as tracers of fluid source and fluid-rock exchange to provide constraints on fluid-rock interaction during continental extension. Isotopic data is linked to specific fluid sources to better constrain the hydrology of crustal-scale fluid flow, in order to bridge the gap between experimentally-derived rock strengths, and field observations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Tectonics program in the Division of Earth Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fundamental processes depend on the transport of babies (larvae) by the ocean currents, yet because the larvae are microscopic and diluted in the vastness of the ocean, it is very difficult to determine where and how they drift.  This project uses an autonomous underwater vehicle to collect larvae from precise regions of the water column.  Larval traps on the bottom and chemical analyses of larval shells will also be used to determine the depths where larvae swim.  These findings will provide realistic estimates for mathematical models that show how biology interacts with ocean currents to predict which methane seeps will be colonized by larvae originating at different depths.  A detailed knowledge of larval dispersal is needed for conservation and management of the deep sea. Without such information, we cannot know the best placement of marine protected areas, nor can we facilitate the reestablishment of communities impacted by deep-sea mining, drilling, or other human activities.  This project will provide hands-on at-sea training for college students to learn the rapidly vanishing skills needed for studies of larvae and embryos in their natural habitats.  Learning opportunities will also be available to individuals of all ages through new, interactive exhibits on deep-sea biology and larval ecology produced for small museums and aquaria on the coasts of Oregon, Washington and North Carolina.  <br/><br/>Reliable estimates of connectivity among metapopulations are increasingly important in marine conservation biology, ecology and phylogeography, yet biological parameters for biophysical models in the deep sea remain largely unavailable. The movements of deep-sea vent and seep larvae among islands of habitat suitable for chemosynthesis have been inferred from current patterns using numerical modeling, but virtually all such models have used untested assumptions about biological parameters that should have large impacts on the predictions. This project seeks to fill in the missing biological parameters while developing better models for predicting the dispersal patterns of methane seep animals living in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Western Atlantic Margin. Despite the existence of similar seeps at similar depths on two sides of the Florida peninsula, the Western Atlantic seeps support only a subset of the species found in the Gulf of Mexico. It is hypothesized that the ability of larvae to disperse through the relatively shallow waters of the Florida Straits depends on an interaction between the adult spawning depth and the dispersal depth of the larvae. Dispersal depth, in turn, will be influenced by larval flotation rates, swimming behaviors, feeding requirements, and ontogenetic migration patterns during the planktonic period.  The recently developed SyPRID sampler deployed on AUV Sentry will be used to collect larvae from precise depth strata in the water column, including layers very near the ocean floor. Larval traps deployed on the bottom at three depths in each region will be used in conjunction with the plankton collections to determine what proportion of larvae are demersal. Comparisons of stable oxygen isotopes between larval and juvenile mollusk shells will provide information on the temperatures (and therefore depths) that larvae develop, and geochemical analyses of larval and juvenile shells will determine whether larval cohorts mix among depth strata.

The main drawback in such devices, however, is the need for a source of magnetic field to tune the operating frequency that requires very high power.  Such tuning also makes them bulky and not compatible for integration with semiconductor devices.  This project is aimed at a new generation of ferrite magnetic devices that are tunable by applying a voltage, and therefore, can be miniaturized and integrated with semiconductor electronics.  The project is motivated by recent reports on strong interaction between the magnetic ordering in the ferrite and electric field generated by the applied voltage, resulting in voltage control of magnetic parameters.  Primary tasks of the proposed research are to grow high quality thin films and single crystals of hexagonal ferrites, studies on the nature of interaction between magnetic order and electric field, and design, fabrication and characterization of ferrite filters and resonators for use in the frequency bands of interest for consumer electronics and systems of importance for the national defense.   Broader impacts of the research include research training in advanced materials synthesis and measurement techniques for undergraduate and graduate students and research experience for high school students.  High school juniors and seniors, women and minorities in particular, will be recruited from local schools to facilitate participation in research. <br/><br/>A research program is proposed on non-linear magnetoelectric (NLME) interactions and electric field control of magnetism in M-type hexagonal ferrites.  The motivation is the recent discovery of the phenomenon in single crystals films of strontium hexaferrite (SrM).  Under a static electric field E, the ME interactions in a thick film of SrM resulted variation in the magnetic order parameters and manifested as tuning of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR).  Studies are planned on single crystal platelets and thin films of pure, and (Co, Ti) and (Co,Sn) substituted Ba and Sr hexaferrites.  These systems have uniaxial anisotropy fields Ha = 4-20 kOe with FMR in the frequency range 10-50 GHz.  Single crystals are on hand and thin films will be grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) on a variety of substrates including MgO and sapphire.   Studies on NLME effects are to be done by observation and tuning of FMR under multi-domain and single domain states for DC, sinusoidal and pulsed E-fields. Data on E-tuning of FMR will be used to estimate variations in magnetic order parameters and NLME coupling coefficients and their dependence on sample and input electrical parameters. An important component of the proposed research is the design of hexaferrite resonators and band-stop and band-pass filters for use at 10-50 GHz and characterization in terms of E-tuning and device figures of merit. Avenues for enhancing device tunability and figures of merit and reduction of electric power requirements will be explored.

Hammond of the University of Louisville. This project is seeks new understanding of chemical reactions that rely on the formation of ions (charged particles). In an ionic reaction, ions can separate (dissociate) or they can form contact ion pairs (where they are just barely separated).  Some solvents easily support the dissociation of ions (e.g., table salt in water).  Other solvents do not allow ions to dissociate (e.g., table salt in oil).  This research seeks to understand how the properties of the solvent affect the ion formation and separation and subsequently, how ion separation impacts the formation of reaction products.  Experimental results are combined with various computational efforts to predict the structures of the ions/ion pairs in solution. Dr. Hammond inspires Hispanic students to enter chemistry and other science fields through his ""Targeting Excellence: Hispanic Latino Student Initiative"" which brings prominent Hispanic chemistry to the University to serve as role models.  He is also establishing links with faculty in chemistry departments from Latin American Universities to attract high caliber research-active scientists and students in collaborative projects.   Professor Hammond works with the California State University, Fresno to host undergraduate students for summer research and also collaborates with Professor Bo Xu, of Donghua University, China.  <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gerald B. Hammond, of the University of Louisville in Kentucky, is investigating ionic reactions.  In an ionic reaction, ions can be dissociated or they can form contain ion pairs.  This research examines how, in low dielectric constant and low solvation power solvents, contact ion pairs interact with reactants and catalysts in a chemical reaction.  Ionic transformations cover a wide range of reaction types, from simple nucleophilic substitutions to complex cationic transition metal catalysis, but the understanding of counterion effects is mainly circumscribed to individual reactions. Toward this goal, his investigations generate affinity scales of counterions for various metal and non-metal groups and implement a new contact ion pair-assisted nucleophilic substitution process (SNip). This conceptually new nucleophilic substitution pathway enables reactivity in those instances where conventional SN2 or SN1 reactions fail. Computational studies of the SNip process are conducted. Also, under investigation is the design of ion pair promoters including chiral ion pair promoters and better electrophiles to facilitate the SNip process. Dr. Hammond is keenly engaged in outreach programs focused on underrepresented student recruitment into the technical fields through summer research internships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They tutor students, help around the house, work in factories, and more. For robotic technology to be the most helpful, it is important to learn how people best interact with it. In this project, the researchers apply theory of social psychology and group dynamics to improve human-robot teaming. Previous research has shown that humans work better with robots that they view as teammates (called 'ingroup') than robots that they view as opponents (called 'outgroup'). However, ingroup and outgroup are social categories, and it is not known how social a robot must behave to benefit from ingroup favoritism. Conversely, it is uncertain if nonsocial robots can avoid the drawbacks of being viewed as outgroup members. In this project, researchers will develop the understanding of these critical factors and apply them to real-world human-robot teams, such as for construction. This will promote the progress of psychological science, demonstrating how far principles of psychological group dynamics extend to nonsocial agents and when these principles break down. The results will lead to robot design recommendations to improve human-robot teaming. For example, this research might indicate that humans and machine-like robots can work most efficiently and smoothly together when the robots behave uniformly.<br/><br/>To examine intergroup human-robot interaction, the researchers will set up cooperative and competitive contexts to elicit group effects and determine how social the robots must be to be treated like ingroup or outgroup members (Study 1). Then the researchers will determine if social group principles, such as entitativity (cohesiveness) of robot groups, affect interactions with them even when robots are nonsocial (paralleling factory-created construction robots in the real world; Study 2). Because human groups will interact with robots (e.g., family members interacting with a home robot, a construction crew), the researchers will examine how human group type (e.g., friend, coworker) affects responses toward the robots (Study 3). Because groups are more competitive than individuals, the researchers will examine one-on-one contact with robots before group interaction with them to reduce prejudice against them (Study 4). Finally, the researchers will apply their research findings from Studies 1-4 to the real world and the introduction of construction robots with their collaborators from the College of Engineering (Study 5). This research will lay the foundation for understanding group dynamics in human-robot interaction. Based on the findings, the researchers will provide design recommendations about what robot form and intragroup behavior will be best suited for intergroup interaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have been studied by many mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics and physics, but only in the last few decades have they moved into the foreground of mathematics. This is due to the remarkable breakthroughs in field, resulting in a rich and beautiful theory with many applications both inside mathematics and to science and engineering. In this project the PI will consider a variety of questions about various spaces with contact structures, focusing on objects inside of them, relations between them, and other structures on them. This will not only further our understanding of the field, but also its impacts on other areas of study. The PI will also devote significant time to helping graduate students and postdoctoral scholars become productive researchers in the field.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate contact and symplectic structures through a variety of techniques, but focusing on their submanifolds and connections to Riemannian metrics. Recall that in dimension 3 understanding Legendrian and transverse knots in a contact manifold has gone hand in hand with advances in our understanding of contact structures and their subtle links with topology. For example the first proof of existence of contact structures came from surgery on transverse knots and the famed tight versus overtwisted dichotomy comes down to the types of Legendrian or transverse knots a contact structure supports. The PI will continue his investigations of such knots in 3 manifolds, focusing on qualitative features of them. Also recall, that many important concepts in contact geometry are expressed in terms of submanifolds of the contact structure (for example, Giroux torsion, open book decompositions, etc). Trying to understand how these various submanifolds interact and how various surgery constructions affect them will be another focus of the PI. The PI will also consider higher dimensional contact manifolds where much less is known. Here, basic questions about the existence and isotopy classification of contact submanifolds (a generalization of transverse knots) and isotropic submanifolds will be considered - as will surgery constructions and how they affect various properties of contact manifolds. Riemannian metrics have long been known to have deep connections with the smooth topology of manifolds and more recently it has been shown that contact structures do as well. The PI will continue to explore relations between these two geometric structures with the goal of seeing key properties of a contact structure (such as tightness) reflected in Riemannian metrics that are adapted to them. This will hopefully lead to a more complete understanding of the general picture of contact structures on 3 manifolds and create new tools for studying higher dimensional contact manifolds. The PI will also explore recent conjectures of Eliashberg about the existence of symplectic structures by explicitly verifying them in some nontrivial cases and exploring inductive approaches to proving them in some general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research investigates how males and females display outwardly similar behaviors when the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are predicted to be different. The project examines the hormonal and genomic basis of territorial aggression a behavior that is widespread across the animal kingdom and critical for reproductive success. Studies of male animals reveal that hormones like testosterone, as well as genes expressed in the brain, regulate aggression. However, aggression is also important for females of many species, especially in birds that compete for limited nesting space. An open question is whether male and female aggression are controlled by similar or different mechanisms. This research will survey multiple bird families to examine differences in aggression between males and females, as well as hormones, gene expression, and genome evolution. <br/><br/>The independent origin of similar phenotypes across distantly-related groups is compelling evidence for natural selection, but the proximate bases of behavioral convergence are poorly understood. This research evaluates the mechanistic convergence underlying a repeatedly evolved behavior: cavity-nesting. Both male and female cavity-nesters compete for nest sites, providing an opportunity to assess the nature and degree of mechanistic parallelism between males and females. This work will broadly sample genomes across a phylogeny to quantify positive selection associated with the evolution of cavity nesting. A comparison of hormonal and neural gene expression for multiple species pairs with and without cavity nesting will assess whether convergent selection on the cavity-nesting phenotype predicts male/female differences in aggression across families. This work tests an emergent hypothesis that gene sequence variation, neural gene expression, and hormone levels act independently to bring about convergent behavioral phenotypes. The project's broader impacts are designed to engage and retain students from underrepresented groups as they transition from high school to college. The fellow will pair with high school teachers near Indiana University to design learning modules on the reproductive stages of cavity-nesting, and engage students in hands-on research with interactive 'eBirdhouses' to collect environmental and behavioral data from wild birds.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet yet cannot multiply without cellular hosts, including microbes. Viruses manipulate the metabolism of the microbes that they infect through numerous mechanisms, which has consequences for global nutrient cycling. One way that viruses modify microbial activities is by genetically altering microbial metabolism to better suit viral replication and this can also alter the way that microbes utilize key nutrients, including nitrogen. Nitrogen is a fundamental chemical in oceans and an essential component of all organisms. Human activities have increased the deposition of nitrogen into natural ecosystems five-fold over the last century. This influx alters the composition and function of microbial communities.

As integral members of aquatic ecosystems, viruses govern microbial diversity, evolution, and metabolism; it is imperative to investigate host-virus dynamics and virus-mediated proliferation of AMGs under anticipated future biogeochemical conditions. In addition to facilitating the Fellow's development of key bioinformatic and molecular skills, this program will enable international collaboration, improve inclusivity and integration of universal design at fieldwork sites, and engage individuals of underrepresented groups through curriculum design and mentorship.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum Mechanics tells us how electrons, atoms and other objects in the microscopic world work. We need to find a description of nature that works at the microscopic and macroscopic scales and everything in between. This is a century-old unsolved problem that is called the ""Quantum Measurement Problem.""  Not only do we want to solve the problem, but we want to use ""quantumness"" at a larger scale, and not understanding the problem stops us from doing this. To solve this problem objects at an intermediate scale, in between the microscopic and macroscopic, need to be studied. This is what the project: ""Coherent Electron Control"" is aiming to do. Microscopic objects, electrons, are placed close to an everyday world object, a wall, so that the description of how the two interact is neither described by Quantum Mechanics, nor Classical Mechanics. New models and theories can be tested in this way. On the practical side, the interaction between electrons and walls has stopped the development of sensitive devices based on electrons, called electron interferometers. The walls destroy the useful quantum mechanical properties of the electrons. If this ""decoherence"" can be overcome, new electron devices can be constructed that measure, for example, small changes in magnetic fields, and may thus find application in the numerous areas of technology where magnetic fields play a key role.<br/><br/>Electron diffraction from nanofabricated gratings will be used to split electron beams coherently into two parts. Walls will be placed close to the electron beams to partially decohere the electron beams. The electron beams are recombined and the measured amount of quantum mechanical interference tells us about the amount of decoherence. Four different existing microscopic theories have now been tested. Control of the decoherence will be explored by changing the wall from insulating copper oxide, to semi-conducting Gallium Arsenide, to conducting gold, and illuminating the walls with laser light and particles. The understanding gained will be used to control and reduce the decoherence and be applied to enlarge the size of existing electron interferometers. In this way it is attempted to construct the largest and most sensitive electron interferometer in the world. Patents will be pursued based on the new technology being developed and the inventions may be marketable. The research project provides experience to graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students in the new research area of free electron quantum optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the disposal of composite wastes mainly relies on the landfills or incineration, which lead to significant environmental and health burdens. A new green, sustainable recycling method was recently developed to address this problem. It uses a bond-exchange reaction between a solvent and the composite to decompose the polymer material at a mild temperature and reclaim clean fibers. The decomposed products can be used to fabricate new composites with near identical material and mechanical properties for the same applications. However, due to the nascent development of this recycling technique, existing studies are limited to the proof of concept demonstrations. This award supports fundamental studies to uncover the relationships between waste material properties, processing conditions, recycling speed, and final mechanical properties of recycled thermosets and composites. The provided scientific knowledge will pave the road for the immediate applications of this innovative recycling method and significantly ease the environmental and health concerns associated with the traditional waste disposal methods. This research will also impact large-scale applications in other industries involving polymer decomposition and recycling, such as removable encapsulation of electronics, non-destructive surface coatings, controlled drug delivery, membrane science, and microlithography. Additionally, the project will provide opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and math.<br/><br/>The research objectives will be realized using an integrated experimental - theoretical - computational approach at multiple length scales: In the microscale, constitutive chemomechanics relations will be defined to link the molecular-level bond-exchange reactions to the evolution of stress field, network structure, and mechanical properties of thermosets during the recycling. In the mesoscale, the constitutive relations will be incorporated into a computational model to study the influences of the fiber-polymer interface on the recycling performance of a composite lamina. In the macroscale, an efficient reduced-order computational model will be developed to guide the selection of solvent and processing conditions to recycle composite structures with the well-controlled geometry and mechanical properties. The chemomechanics theory defined in this award will be used to address three fundamental questions that are mostly concerned in the composite recycling industry: (i) how fast can the composites be recycled, (ii) what is the lowest recycling cost, and (iii) how to improve the mechanical properties of recycled products?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project responds to these priorities by engaging teams of students and teachers of grades 7-12 in four competitive Challenges to design innovative strategies for carbon mitigation in areas such as transportation, agriculture or energy use. The project expands the typical boundaries of schools by enabling teams of students in multiple locations to collaborate in model-based reasoning through online discussion forums, using social media, and crowdsourcing ideas to construct possible solutions to environmental challenges. Project research will examine the impacts of the project on student learning and engagement.  <br/><br/>This early stage Design and Development study is guided by the hypothesis that competitive challenges supported by social media and crowdsourcing will engage a diverse array of students in sustained and meaningful scientific inquiry.  Over a period of four years, the project will design and refine four Challenges that will engage approximately 1,000 students of ages 13-17. Project research is guided by three overarching questions related to the design of the Challenges, the influence of school contextual factors, and student learning and self-efficacy.  The questions are: (1) How do features of the challenge environment support the work of teams, and the participation of students from communities historically underserved in STEM? (2) What structures within the school ecosystem support or raise obstacles to team work? And (3) Does participation in a Challenge result in the intended student outcomes. Intended outcomes include: a) Learning of basic concepts related to the science of the project focus; b) Engagement in learning disciplinary core ideas, cross-cutting concepts and science and engineering practices; c) Persistence in completing a Challenge; and d) self-efficacy in STEM. Students and their teachers will cross disciplinary boundaries as they choose concepts from chemistry, engineering, mathematics, biology, and social science to support their innovations.Teachers, students, staff members and advisors will comment and provide quidance to the teams on a range of issues through crowdsourcing. Design research will be used to examine how features of the Challenge environment supports the work of teachers and teams, and implementation research will focus on participant learning at the individual and team levels. The project will engage at least 25 teams of 3-4 students each, and researchers will track team activity during all phases of the Challenge process. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative analyses will be used to examine outcomes, and data for girls and others from underserved populations will be disaggregated for separate analyses.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Many glaciers in Alaska are covered by a layer of rocks and sediment, but there are very few direct measurements of how these debris-covered glaciers decay and affect glacier decline. The debris cover is expected to suppress glacier melting, but studies in the Himalayas have shown that many heavily debris-covered glacier tongues thin and decay just as fast as similar debris-free glaciers. The underlying mechanisms for this more rapid than expected glacier change are not well understood. Very limited observations exist in Alaska, where many glaciers are heavily debris-covered. A better understanding of these glaciers is necessary to develop better models predicting how they will melt and affect landscapes in the future.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of debris cover in modulating glacier surface and glacier mass change on the declining Kennicott Glacier in Alaska. The researchers will characterize the debris cover and observe the pattern and rate of dynamic change of the debris-covered lower reaches of Kennicott Glacier using field observations and remote sensing, to quantify the effect of debris cover on the annual mass change of the entire glacier. They will collect field data including meteorological and mass balance observations to constrain modeling on both detailed and larger spatial scales. The goal is to develop a model that can parameterize both melt suppression under thick debris and melt enhancement across ice cliffs, making it suitable for application on a regional scale. The project will provide training for several students, and field study examples for an international class of glaciology graduate students attending a successful summer school at this site. It also allows the work to be used by several local educational programs outside glaciology.

Yong Cai, Guangliang Liu, and Kevin O'Shea at the Florida International University are funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry to study the reactions of mercury (Hg) that is associated with particles in aquatic environments. These particulate Hg species (pHg) are very common in natural waters, and they are often thought of as unreactive and not very mobile. However, they do react under the influence of sunlight (photochemical reactions) and need to be considered for an accurate description of Hg cycling, especially the air-water exchange of Hg. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of these photochemical reactions and explore the role of pHg in the air-water Hg exchange. The project has a broad range of benefits to research, education, and outreach at a Hispanic Serving Institution. It provides training for PhD and undergraduate students. Underrepresented minority students gain research experience. The curriculum development of the unique Environmental Chemistry-focused PhD track program is being enhanced. The project also promotes public awareness on Hg contamination and health risks. <br/><br/>Since the aquatic particles are semiconducting and photosensitizing in nature, the investigators focus on the photochemical reactions of pHg involving electron-hole pairs and reactive oxygen species. They define the reaction pathways of pHg phototransformations and quantify the kinetics of photochemical reduction of oxidized Hg species and the oxidation of elemental pHg. They also study the mechanisms related to the pHg photoreactions. Experiments using model iron, titanium, and manganese oxide particles of different band gap energies and field-collected particles are combined with quantum chemistry calculations. The bandgap energies analysis uses spectrometric measurements. Particle chemical composition and optical properties are determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The analysis of elemental and oxidized Hg in the dissolved and particulate phases is based on an isotope dilution, purge and trap, thermal desorption, and ICP-MS method. The research is expected to clarify the involvement of pHg species in Hg photochemical transformation and the role in air-water Hg exchange.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most often energy (as heat) is transported slowly through materials through the random motion of electrons and atoms making up the material (this is called ""thermal diffusion""). Professor Rubtsov's research group has discovered systems where energy deposited in long molecules is rapidly transferred to distant locations, not unlike a bullet or projectile. This anomalous transfer of energy may help scientists discover new materials with improved thermal transport properties. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are receiving training in optical science, laser spectroscopy and quantum theory. The PI and co-PI participate in a number of educational activities on their campus, including the Tulane Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program, which provides undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science with authentic research experiences.<br/> <br/>Professors Igor Rubtsov and Alexander Burin and their respective research groups are combining ultrafast laser spectroscopy (relaxation-assisted two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR)) with theoretical modeling to develop a better understanding of how the very rapid energy transport over molecularly-significant distances occurs. Some of the questions that these scientists hope to answer include: What are the main factors determining the speed of ballistic transport and how to increase its efficiency? How do the transport parameters, such as efficiency, speed, band selection, and cooling rate, depend on the environment and temperature? Can these transport parameters be controlled by external stimuli and how to design molecules for such control? Can the ballistic transport be efficient against the direction of thermal gradient? Among the factors affecting transport to be examined are the primary and secondary chain structure, chain architecture, the nature and energy of the source vibrational mode, and the temperature. These studies are identifying the most likely transport mechanisms and, as such, will likely suggest ways of reducing losses for ballistic energy transport and directing energy to specific targets. The ballistic transport mechanism is considered as a principal component of energy transport in molecules, especially for molecules featuring functional groups with repeating units, which are very common. These studies are helping us understanding how to use the ballistic transport and how to manipulate its outcome. Establishing the fundamental principles needed to make the process either fast and efficient or slow and inefficient could impact a broad class of problems that take center stage in nanoscience and molecular electronics. In addition to the aforementioned training and outreach activities, this project includes the the designing of a novel undergraduate course that incorporates the knowledge obtained in the program and implements an experimental exercise on 2DIR  spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Mammals vary by a magnitude of shapes from robust tank-like elephants to elongate rodents. What contributes to this range of body shapes? Why do some closely related species exhibit similar body shapes (e.g. mice and rats) whereas others belong to groups with members that hardly resemble one another (e.g. elephants and manatees)? Can unifying evolutionary or ecological patterns that led to this diversity in mammalian body shapes be identified? And could these patterns have led to the major transitions that we observe in primates and even human lineages? To answer these questions, this project will assemble a database that records body shapes in mammals and test questions about the ecology and evolution of body shapes and the underlying forms that contribute to diverse body plans. The fellow will also work the American Museum of Natural History to showcase the great diversity of mammalian body forms.<br/><br/>Understanding the major patterns and adaptive significance of phenotypic variation is a central goal of evolutionary biology. In vertebrates, body shape diversity is one of the most prominent features of phenotypic variation that can lead to increased diversification, niche specialization, and innovations within a clade. However, biologists still lack a full understanding of the underlying morphological components that contribute to body shape diversity, particularly in endothermic vertebrates such as mammals. Consequently, little is known about the morphology, ecology, and evolution of mammalian body shapes as well as the underlying traits that contribute to different body plans. This research will test hypotheses pertaining to the evolutionary integration of the cranial, axial, and appendicular components that contribute to body shape diversity, and the adaptive significance of body shapes. To accomplish these goals, this research will generate the first quantitative database of mammalian body shapes using skeletal specimens held at natural history museums and test the following hypotheses: H1) skeletal components contributing to body shape diversity in carnivorans are evolutionarily integrated, H2) the relationship between body shape and limb length in mammals follows a similar trend as ectothermic vertebrates, and H3) locomotor and dietary ecologies influence the evolution of carnivoran body shapes. The fellow will also work the American Museum of Natural History to showcase the great diversity of mammalian cranial, axial, and appendicular skeletons and their contributions towards generating diversity and disparity in mammals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These have found applications throughout mathematics and mathematical physics. This project proposes to study the geometry of cluster algebras in two senses. The first is to apply tools from algebraic geometry to the study of cluster varieties. This will hopefully enable us to understand the structure of integrals computed on cluster varieties, which are common in applications to particle physics. The second sense is to describe cluster varieties using the geometry of reflection groups. These are the symmetries formed by reflections over collections of mirrors. Such connections are already well known for finite reflection groups, but the typical cluster variety should be related to the properties of infinite reflection groups, and these are still very poorly understood.<br/><br/>More precisely, the first project is to compute the mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of cluster varieties. This is joint work with Thomas Lam. In previous work, the PI and his collaborator have discovered a ""curious Lefschetz symmetry"" in these mixed Hodge structures. They intend to build a spectral sequence to help compute these mixed Hodge structures, and they intend to study connections between these computations, rational Catalan theory and character varieties. The second project has as its ultimate goal describing cluster fans and cluster complexes in terms of infinite Coxeter groups. Nathan Reading and the PI previously did this for cluster varieties of finite type, which corresponded to finite Coxeter groups, and partially succeeded in doing so in general. The obstacle to further progress was that they needed a lattice into which they could embed an infinite Coxeter group; in the finite case, the Coxeter group itself is such a lattice. The current project, joint with Nathan Reading and Hugh Thomas, proposes to solve this problem by using ideas from the representation theory of quivers. They also intend to find combinatorial models of these lattices, and hope to eventually find applications to cluster varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This collaboration between DePauw University in the United States and Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan will lead to a deeper understanding of the role that cuteness plays in fostering positive human response to, and acceptance of, robotic gadgets.  Building on research related to the Japanese concept of kawaii (Japanese cuteness), this project involves designing prototypes of robotic gadgets with varying levels and types of cuteness, and conducting multi-site, cross-cultural user studies that evaluate user?s reactions to varied designs.  A long-term goal of this research is to deepen our understanding of how designers can use the concept of kawaii to build robotic gadgets that are accepted by diverse users. <br/><br/>The project provides educational and research experiences, at the individual and cohort level, for a diverse group of twelve students comprised of four undergraduates participating in each of three summers.  Before departing for Japan, students will complete cultural and technical preparatory activities led collaboratively by two DePauw faculty members with remote contributions from three Shibaura Institute of Technology faculty members.  Each student will then conduct research for seven weeks at Shibaura Institute of Technology under the primary mentorship of the Shibaura faculty members with supplemental remote and on-site mentorship from the DePauw faculty members. In addition to informing inclusive design practices for robotic gadgets, the project will serve as a catalyst for ongoing collaborations between DePauw University and Shibaura Institute of Technology.  <br/><br/>The concept of kawaii (Japanese cuteness) is considered an essential element of Japanese design and is commonly seen in both low-tech and high-tech products including robots and robotic gadgets. Increasingly, kawaii is incorporated into successful products that are used globally.  An object?s kawaii-ness is an important part of its affect, which may influence a user?s likability and acceptance of the object.  Previous publications by the project team and others have investigated several aspects of kawaii in simple static objects, including analysis across cultures and genders. Other researches have evaluated various affective properties of robots. Building on prior work, the DePauw-Shibaura collaboration will investigate cross-cultural and gender differences related to perceptions of kawaii, specifically in robotic gadgets, with the aim of understanding how to design devices that are accepted by diverse users.  <br/><br/>Each student will work on a project that involves designing and prototyping several versions (with varying degrees and types of kawaii-ness) of a domain-specific robotic gadget, and then conducting one or more experiments from a user-study suite that measures a user?s emotional reaction to the gadgets using measurements obtained through self-reports and/or biosensors. We will gather data from subjects in both Japan and the United States, which will allow us to compare user reactions across both culture and gender.  <br/><br/>One challenge in running a cross-cultural, multi-site user study involving prototypes of robotic gadgets involves replicability.  It is difficult to build several identical prototypes for use at different sites and even more difficult to build several versions of each prototype that incorporate different kawaii properties.  Therefore, we will explore the use of traditional video, as well as stereoscopic 3D video, to record each prototype and to present the prototype consistently to users at different sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limited or variable shore ice cover results in enhanced storm-induced coastal erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure. The dynamics of how reduced ice cover influences coastal evolution is poorly understood which inhibits accurate forecasting of future coastal response in cold climates. This work aims to improve our fundamental understanding of how sediment interacts with shore ice as well as the resulting coastal landscape change. The first part of the project will involve laboratory experiments aimed at studying the physics of sediment and ice interactions. The second part of the project will gather field measurements that use the laboratory measurements as a basis to investigate how cold climate coastlines naturally respond to the shore ice. This study will result in a model that will help explain how reduced and variable winter shore ice cover alters the coastal landscape, which will help coastal managers proactively plan for future climate change impacts. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students who will be recruited from groups underrepresented in the STEM fields.  Public educational resources will be delivered to inner-city schools through partnership with Chicago Public Schools and will be shared nationally through The Scientific Research and Education Network (www.sciren.org), which is a science education non-profit founded by the PI.<br/><br/>Accurate modeling of coastal evolution in cold climates is hindered by a limited understanding of the processes and responses associated with winter shore ice. This study will utilize unoccupied aerial and aquatic systems through a combined field and laboratory approach to test the hypothesis that variable ice cover is more erosive than consistent ice cover. This approach will yield the most comprehensive understanding to date of the morphodynamics of nearshore ice. Laboratory experiments in a frozen wave tank and ring shear apparatus will be used to constrain the forces required to entrain sediment within ice as well as the fundamental processes associated with transporting sediment-laden ice. Field investigations will be used to validate laboratory experiments as well as to describe the geomorphic processes and responses associated with shore ice. We will isolate the primary conditions facilitating sediment transport and shoreface geomorphic change during winter and resolve how the shoreface responds to these processes, which will provide the basis for models to include coastal evolution in cold temperature climates. The final result of this proposed study will be a conceptual model and set of empirically derived equations generated from the field and laboratory measurements that describe how shore ice drives sediment transport. This knowledge will be shared with practitioners through Great Lakes Coastal Zone Management Programs, local and regional stakeholder groups, and federal agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, two enigmatic dome-shaped structures called the ""Large Shear Wave Velocity Provinces"" (or LLSVPs) rise from the base of the mantle to around 1000 km above, one beneath Africa and the other beneath the Pacific Ocean.  Seismic waves that emanate from earthquakes sometimes travel through these LLSVPs and are slowed down when they enter these structures.   It is still unclear why this might be the case: LLSVPs could be hotter (and thus more buoyant) than their surroundings, or they could be chemically distinct (and likely denser) than their surroundings.  Both suggest fundamental differences in how the mantle flows over millions of years and therefore how it influences tectonic plate motions and the related natural disasters.  The PIs plan to, for the first time, combine information from traditional seismic data sets but also measurements from special types of seismic waves and earth tides to shed new light on the buoyancy of these LLSVPs.  The special type of seismic waves are called Stoneley modes and are vibrations trapped along the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and the earth tides are the twice-daily deformation of the solid Earth under gravitational forces from the Sun and Moon.  This award will support the training of two graduate students at UC Berkeley and two female PIs, one of whom is an early career scientist and new faculty member at UC Berkeley.  The models developed in this project will be made available as part of a webpage specifically developed for this project, as well as through the Incorporated Research Institution for Seismology (IRIS) facility. They will be used in undergraduate workshops at UC Berkeley and at the interdisciplinary CIDER workshop geared towards senior graduate students and early career scientists.<br/><br/>Within the last two years, independent studies have presented seemingly contradictory results on the density structure of the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) imaged by seismic tomography in the earth's deep mantle.  In particular, one study used a variety of seismological data (normal mode splitting, seismic travel time and waveform data), and another, semi-diurnal earth tide data, concluding that a significant part of the LLSVPs represent regions of excess density pointing to the source of the LLSVP anomalies being dominated by chemical heterogeneity.  In contrast, a study featuring measurements of Earth's Stoneley modes concluded the opposite, implying that the source of LLSVP anomalies are in large part thermal.  Both conclusions paint a very different picture of mantle convection: the former implies that the LLSVPs are potentially sluggish upwellings or stabilized piles, while the latter implies a more energetic mode of mantle circulation.  In this project, the investigators will combine these different geodetic and seismic datasets - which have different depth sensitivities to elastic and density structure - to establish whether previous results can be reconciled under the hypothesis that the excess density in LLSVPs may be confined to a thin layer (~200 km or less) above the CMB.  In doing so, they will investigate further trade-offs with shear and compressional wave speed structure, anisotropy, attenuation, as well as CMB topography and possible structure in the outermost core. First, they will consider a combination of existing global seismic waveform, tide and normal mode splitting data, including Stoneley mode data, and perform inversions for structure in the deepest mantle, using the classical first order mode perturbation formalism for modeling splitting data. They will implement both an optimization and a trans-dimensional Monte Carlo inversion method for this purpose. This, in large part, will act as a guide to prepare for the more advanced inversions to be undertaken in the next stage, while yielding interesting intermediate results.  In the second stage, after completing their own dataset of normal mode spectra, they will consider a more rigorous theoretical approach and directly invert mode spectra, together with long period waveform and tide data (complemented by newly acquired data) for density and velocity structure in the vicinity of the CMB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It describes the fundamental building blocks of the universe, including the elementary particles whose interactions are measured at the Large Hadron Collider, and it also describes the sources of energy that drive the evolution of the cosmos.  In this way string theory is capable of connecting particle physics and cosmology.  The research funded by this award focuses on the implications of string theory for these two disciplines. There are two central challenges. First, certain aspects of string theory proper still remain to be understood. In particular, in collaboration with mathematicians, Halverson will study the regime in which strings interact strongly. An improved understanding of this regime is necessary for a complete understanding of string interactions. Second, string theory predicts a vast array of possible laws of physics --- an array known as the string landscape --- prompting the question of how the laws we observe are realized in nature and whether their realization leads to new predictions for experiments. From a practical point of view, however, the landscape can be viewed as an enormous dataset. As part of this project, Halverson, in collaboration with computer scientists, will therefore utilize techniques from data science and machine learning to study the landscape.  Research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of physical law.   Halverson's research will also have significant broader impacts by enabling and engaging new communities of researchers. These include professionals in industry, high-school students, and the internet data-science community. Among Halverson's activities, a lecture series will be developed for and delivered to members of these communities in order to give them the essential background information for carrying out research at the interface of data science and string theory. <br/><br/>More technically, Halverson will carry out formal work at strong coupling in string theory. He will study string junctions in F-theory on singular spaces, aspects of non-Higgsable clusters, and G2 compactifications of M-theory. He will also study physical problems in the string landscape using techniques from data science, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks. The interplay between computational complexity and the use of these techniques in physical problems will be addressed. Halverson will also study the particle physics and cosmological implications of the low-energy degrees of freedom that arise regularly in the landscape, including those associated with large dark gauge sectors and the string axiverse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The freezing and thawing of permafrost leads to subsidence and development of hills and depressions; these alter the direction of surface waters, and challenge the stability of construction. Warming of permafrost causes decay of biomass as well as release and transport of methane gas from hydrate and other stores underneath the frozen layers. Methane gas is a major contributor to greenhouse gas balances, and its presence, transport, and evolution, as well as that of  methane hydrate, an ice-like substance, are of great interest in geophysics, climate studies, and energy engineering. Methane hydrate can dissociate to gas, and is a potential unconventional energy source, drilling hazard, and contributor to sub-sea slope instability.  The realistic scenarios and case studies motivating this work include the melting of ice to water and dissociation of methane hydrate into gas in response to increased temperature or mechanical disturbance, with the liquid and gas phases traveling through the sediment. Models of similar nature also apply to bubble and steam transport, e.g., due to microbial activity, or in geysers. In this project the principal investigator will develop new mathematical results as well as those useful for geophysics, and continue interdisciplinary modeling efforts across the many fields. <br/> <br/>This project addresses mathematical and computational challenges arising in the  models of phase change in porous media such as permafrost or sub-sea sediments, and the evolution and migration of the resident liquid and the dissociated gas phase. For these coupled processes of  energy and  mass transport, data and some nonlinear model systems of PDEs at the spatial and temporal (Darcy) scale of the reservoir are available. However, the new dynamics in the Earth's environment calls for further insights into the processes across the several interlinked spatial and temporal scales including the pore-scale.The models at the pore-scale  bridge the physics between the interface and Darcy scales, account for confinement within the porous walls and complex geometries, and can be upscaled to Darcy scale.  While x-ray micro-tomography can deliver unprecedented insight into pore-scale processes, at present, this data is rather sparse for conditions near phase transitions. These challenge the current knowledge and motivate the project. The research will advance the understanding of the  micro-scale (pore-scale and interface scale) processes which inform the Darcy scale models.  The project will develop and analyze algorithms for relevant models; many techniques and results are of independent interest.  The evolution models the principal investigator will consider are complex and delicate, and involve pointwise constraints on the solutions in and out of the equilibrium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Principal Investigator (PI) will study basic mathematical objects by studying their symmetries, and by studying how the objects change under transformations: this is the study of group actions.  The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.  When the objects of interest are highly complex or not easily parametrized, these problems are difficult to approach, and the PI's program centers on several new techniques to render rigidity problems tractable.  The project also involves the introduction of active-learning courses for undergraduate mathematics students, including a program to train graduate students in teaching methods, and a major workshop on effectively communicating mathematics across research areas with the aim of increasing communication between mathematicians in disparate fields.  <br/><br/><br/>A major guiding principle in the PI's work is that rigidity of group actions, in the sense of topological dynamics, is often the result of an underlying geometric structure.

This project builds on this success of this program, extending this theme to new contexts and applications. The PI will continue work on flat bundles and rigid monodromy group actions, using techniques from foliation theory and coarse geometry in negative curvature to study boundary actions.  Another strand of this project involves an investigation of rigidity of infinite discrete groups acting on the circle through the topology of spaces of circular orders, following work of A. Navas.  Finally, the PI will adapt techniques from geometric group theory to the new context of non-locally compact groups, applying this this to study the dynamics of group actions on surfaces, and refining the notion of distortion and growth in transformation groups introduced by Gromov.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some plants can extend their roots substantially below the surface to take advantage of ground water, giving them a moisture reservoir that persists through dry seasons and droughts.  When plants tap into this reservoir they transpire moisture through their leaves, providing a source of moisture to the atmosphere at a time when the air may be at its driest. The extent to which this transpired groundwater influences meteorological conditions such as precipitation, cloudiness, and atmospheric stability is not known, nor is its dependence on region, season, and other factors.<br/><br/>The transpiration of groundwater involves a complex set of biological and physical processes which are difficult to observe and simulate. But the PIs have developed a scheme in which the bulk effect of these processes can be approximated using two observationally-motivated assumptions. First, the extent to which plants extend their roots to tap groundwater depends on their position relative to the local topography.  In dry or seasonally dry climates plants on a hilltop are typically too high above the water table to effectively access groundwater, so we can assume that they rely exclusively on near-surface soil moisture.  At the valley floor the water table can be so close to the surface that plant roots have to be shallow to avoid excessive salinity and waterlogging, so they also rely exclusively on near-surface moisture.  Thus maximum groundwater uptake occurs at mid-hillslope locations, and groundwater usage depends on the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND). The PIs have developed a ""giant hillslope"" method to quantify this dependence in terms of a five-bin representation of small-scale HAND topography.<br/><br/>Second, roots respond dynamically to the vertical profile of soil water.  The PIs argue that root dynamics can be simply represented by assuming that roots actively extend to reach available groundwater, taking up water from whatever level offers the greatest moisture access for the least effort. This assumption is formalized using a scheme in which the transport of moisture through roots is analogous to the movement of electric current in a circuit: the roots act as ""wires"", through which a ""current"" of moisture flows from a specific soil layer to the plant leaves, driven by the ""voltage"" difference (i.e. water potential difference) between plant leaves and the soil layer tapped by the roots. The flow of moisture from a soil layer to the surface is then given by the ratio of the layer-to-leaves voltage drop to the resistance of the wire, in exact analogy to Ohm's law (electric current equals voltage divided by resistance).<br/><br/>The PIs implement their root-groundwater scheme in the Noah land-surface model, which is coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to form a coupled land-atmosphere model.  The model is then used to test the impact of groundwater transpiration on the continental-scale hydrological cycle.  Among the scientific questions to be addressed is the extent to which groundwater transpiration promotes precipitation, both by making a substantial contribution to the moisture available for precipitation, and by reducing atmospheric stability.<br/><br/>The research has societal value due to the importance of the hydrological cycle for water resources. The work is of particular value for building bridges between the research communities concerned with the separate but closely connected fields of land surface hydrology, continental-scale hydroclimate, and plant ecology.  The implementation of the new scheme in the WRF model will make it available for operational use, as WRF is widely used for weather forecasting.  The PIs also conduct educational and outreach activities in K-12 schools, and the project supports two graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If viable unmodified circulating tumor cells can be separated from whole blood, then subsequent clinical analysis of these cells can lead to personalized cancer treatment. However, due to the extreme rarity of circulating tumor cells, a successful separation technology must meet the performance metrics of high-throughput, high-sensitivity, high-purity, and high-viability simultaneously to be useful - a goal that has never been achieved. To tackle these performance metrics, this project utilizes a novel threefold method called Three-Dimensional Deterministic Dielectrophoresis. Currently, the combined effects of three-dimensional geometry, deterministic lateral displacement and dielectrophoresis in a cell separation process represent a gap in research. Through this research, comprehensive understanding of the interplay between fluid mechanics, cell deformation, dielectrophoretic forces, and deterministic lateral displacement structures will be gained, which will lead to much improved sensitivity, purity, and cell viability at high-throughput - all requirements to be met at the same time. Additionally, the project will have a significant impact on a large number of underrepresented students in technical fields at both University of Illinois at Chicago (a federally designated Minority Serving Institution) and Washington State University Vancouver (a Research in Undergraduate Institutions eligible institution and the only four-year research university in southwest Washington). <br/><br/>The Three-Dimensional Deterministic Dielectrophoresis method brings a transformative impact by creating meaningful and valuable links between previously unconnected ideas and domain knowledge - namely deterministic lateral displacement, dielectrophoresis, and three-dimensional printing - potentially disrupting and outperforming all existing alternatives. However, in order to make the method truly useful for medical practice, fundamental knowledge about the separation process must be gained. This breaks down into three research objectives: 1) Study cell transport, cell-obstacle collision dynamics, and cell dielectrophoresis in periodic obstacle arrays using predictive models with experimental validations; 2) Fabricate Three-Dimensional Deterministic Dielectrophoresis devices and characterize how different obstacle shapes, geometries, obstacle array patterns, dielectrophoresis field parameters, carrier fluids and flow rates influence the cell separation performance; 3) Characterize circulating tumor cell separation performance for lung tumor cells against the four performance metrics above. This proposed research is significant because the multiphysics numerical models will elucidate scientific mechanisms of the complex separation principles of this method, which will guide experimental realization of a microfluidic device for high-throughput label-free circulating tumor cell separation. The research is unique in that dielectrophoresis will be combined with deterministic lateral displacement in a three-dimensional micro-structure for the first time, which is enabled by state-of-the-art nano three-dimensional printing technology. The research outcomes here have important implications for clinical applications including early cancer detection as well as diagnosis and prediction of cancer progression, as circulating tumor cells are increasingly recognized as predictive biomarkers in early stage cancer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Storm surge and waves can impact coastal regions from the ocean and heavy precipitation can cause river and urban flooding.  These kinds of flooding events have generally been considered independently, but it is well known that the same storms can produce multiple types of flooding.  This project will address these multiple, coincidental flooding events, known as compound flooding.  The main societal impact of the award will be in the areas of weather forecasting and risk management.  The research team will engage other federal agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers and the US Geological Survey, to relay the results of the project to the infrastructure planning communities.  This project also represents an international collaboration between scientists from the US and the UK.<br/><br/>This project addresses the topic of compound flooding, where multiple flood drivers occur concurrently or in close succession.  Compound flooding is especially impactful along coastlines, where storm surges, waves, river flooding, and direct runoff can combine to exacerbate potential flooding situations.  The research team, including personnel from the UK and US, plan to conduct a variety of analyses, including dependence analyses, state-of-the-art weather typing approaches, multivariate extreme value analysis, and advanced ensemble hydrodynamic modelling to determine where and why compound flood events occur.  The specific goals of the proposal are to: 1) Determine relevant variables that can lead to compound events along coastlines on both sides of the North Atlantic and assess the spatial footprints of the individual drivers; 2) Assess which large-scale weather types and other conditions led to the identified compound events in the past and determine if and how the frequency of compound events has changed in the past and may change in the future; 3) Quantify the likelihood of the occurrence of compound events along different stretches of coastline including relevant variables and spatial footprints; and 4) Integrate the results to quantify the extent to which compounding effects from multiple flood sources exacerbate impacts to coastal communities.<br/><br/>This is a project that is jointly funded  by the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National  Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement.

Earth?s finite amount of water means that whenever one of these reservoirs fills, the others must empty to balance it. This simple principle - conservation of mass - has powerful implications for society's ability to understand past climate and sea-level change, and potentially for predicting these into the future. To understand the impacts of past changes in water and climate, the researchers ask a simple and fundamental set of questions: First, how did the global water balance respond to the climate of the last glacial period? Second, how did that response in turn impact the climate system through evaporation from the land, runoff into the ocean, and ecological change linked with the global distribution and function of wetlands? In this project the researchers will develop a new model that links these components of the hydrological cycle, and apply this to the recent geological past when vast ice sheets covered the high latitudes and lakes filled now-dry basins. By connecting this new model with geological data, the researchers hope to understand how changes in past sea level are distributed among ice sheets and water on the continents, including groundwater, lakes, and wetlands. They will also investigate how sudden freshwater release can impact ocean circulation and global climate. In parallel with this research, they will communicate the importance of water in the environment by sharing their digitally reconstructed ancient land- and water-scapes online, developing a watershed board game for educators, and contributing their findings to scientific journals and Wikipedia.<br/><br/>Terrestrial water storage plays a crucial role in climate, ecosystems, land-atmosphere interactions, and sea level. To date, most studies of the last deglaciation focus on changes in the ice sheets, but overlook the other components of the terrestrial hydrologic system: lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater, and permafrost. As a result the magnitude and pace of change of non-glacial terrestrial water storage - and its potential impact on the climate system - remains unknown. Here the researchers propose to reconstruct the global hydrologic environment during the last deglaciation. To do so, they will: (a) compile, integrate, and synthesize proxies for terrestrial paleohydrology since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM); (b) develop a coupled model linking glacial isostatic adjustment, lakes and rivers, and groundwater; and (c) integrate data and model to quantify the time evolution of global terrestrial hydrology. This output will allow them to quantify: (1) the migration, expansion, and contraction of surface water bodies; (2) the total amount of water stored on land and its impact on sea-level records and ice-sheet reconstructions; and (3) water inputs to the ocean through evapotranspiration and submarine groundwater discharge, alongside their potential to reconcile ice-sheet reconstructions with records of sea level and past ocean circulation. In conjunction with these research activities, the researchers will deliver their paleohydrologic reconstructions as maps available on Wikimedia Commons and Flyover Country, build instructional materials on past environments, and improve Wikipedia's coverage of hydrologic and paleoclimate science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems arise in a wide variety of contexts in the physical, biological, and social sciences as well as engineering, and this project focuses on the mathematical study of such long-time behavior in a variety of models with a specific focus on those arising in plasma physics, turbulent combustion, and population dynamics.  Two major fundamental challenges in the models considered are the existence of multiple temporal and spatial scales and nonlocal interactions.  The former requires developing an understanding of how small-scale oscillations ""average out"" over long time scales; for instance, in flame propagation, a ""small"" random drift produces fluctuations of the front whose statistics are given by limiting stochastic equation.  The latter requires determining the impact of complex long-range interactions.  A typical example considered in this project is the influence of chemotaxis (which is the phenomenon in which each individual bacterium ""senses"" other bacteria and moves towards the population center) on bacterial invasions.  In both cases, the aim is to determine which features of the systems are predictable and under what conditions such predictions hold.  Various educational activities, including the training of young researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level, are planned.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop technical tools that allow to better characterize the effects of stochastic fluctuations of the environment and nonlocal interactions between individuals affects the long-time behavior of solutions to several reaction-diffusion, Hamilton-Jacobi, and kinetic equations.  The project breaks down into two major portions.  The first encompasses front propagation problems in which a moving interface separating two states emerges.  The shape and dynamics of this interface are strongly related to the fluctuations of the media and to internal interactions.  The second is the regularity and boundedness of kinetic models coming from plasma physics.  New estimates of solutions to these equations continue to emerge via the application of ideas from the parabolic theory.  The goal is to combine these ideas with a precise understanding of nonlocal effects in order to weaken current restrictions on the well-posedness theory and develop physically reasonable conditions under which blow-up is prevented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the persistence of males and females along with reproduction that involves genetic recombination, is a classic problem in biology.  The problem stems from the basic fact that males do not give birth.  Thus, an all-female lineage that reproduces by simply replicating the adult female (cloning) would be expected to produce twice as many offspring as a population with both males and females.  This mode of reproduction should lead to the very rapid spread of the clonal form in populations.  But, in spite of this reproductive advantage, clonal reproduction is rare. This paradox dates back to Charles Darwin, and dozens of hypotheses for the advantages of genetic recombination have been put forward. One of the leading hypotheses is the Red Queen, which posits that recombining offspring are favored, on average, because genetically diverse offspring would be more likely to escape rapidly evolving parasites. The goal of this project is to synthesize more than thirty years of work on the Red Queen hypothesis.  The synthesis would be published as a book targeting advanced undergraduates and graduate students in biology, would be of interest to the general public. The project also involves the training of secondary school teachers and the continued development of card games to teach high school and college students about evolution.<br/><br/>The model organism for this work is a New Zealand freshwater snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in which females that produced recombined offspring and those that only produce clonal offspring coexist. The book would synthesize long-term field observations along with shorter term experiments designed to determine the cost and benefits of producing genetically variable, cross-fertilized offspring. The book would also synthesize theoretical studies of the Red Queen hypothesis; and it would cover some of the key concepts in evolutionary biology, such as hard versus soft selection, frequency-dependent selection, bet-hedging, mutation accumulation, stable equilibria versus oscillatory dynamics, and mate choice.  The book would also lay out the fundamentals regarding the ecology and genetics of infectious disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are brighter than 100 billion stars like our Sun, but so far away that they appear very faint in our nighttime sky. We study them with large telescopes, like the ones at the Keck Observatory on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Measurements like that show that quasars are very massive black holes surrounded by hot gas that is being pulled into the black hole by the hole's enormous gravity. The gas falling into the black hole goes faster and faster the closer it gets. This produces extreme heat that makes the gas around the black hole glow brighter than an entire galaxy full of stars. The black hole surrounded by bright glowing gas is what we call a quasar. They live in the centers of all large galaxies like our Milky Way, but only at certain early times in a galaxy's life when there is a lot of gas available to fall into the black hole. Some of the gas trying to fall into the black hole is, instead, ejected at high speeds due to the intense heat and radiation. This produces a powerful wind that spreads across the galaxy. This project will study a particular group of quasars that appear to be very young and very bright, with extremely powerful winds that might alter the growth and development of the galaxies around them. Project goals are to understand how the powerful winds from quasars are created, and then study the effects those winds have on the surrounding galaxies. Another important goal is to turn the data obtained for this project into music that will be used for science education and outreach in our local communities. <br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>Quasars are distant signposts that mark important episodes in the growth and development of large galaxies. Quasars produce the light energy of a 100 billion Suns due to matter heating up as it falls into a massive black hole. They deep inside young galaxies that are, themselves, gaining mass from their surroundings and rapidly making stars. Quasars with red colors caused by dust obscuration (similar to red sunsets) are believed to identify a critical transition phase in galaxy formation between the initial dusty ""burst"" of star formation and the eventual emergence of normal blue (unobscured) quasars. Powerful outflows driven by the quasars and/or the accompanying starbursts are thought to be critically important during this transition phase, providing ""feedback"" to the surroundings that regulates the amounts of black hole accretion, disrupts star formation in the surrounding galaxy, and expels much of the host galaxy's gas and dust. This project describes a 3-year program to 1) study red quasars and quasar outflows/feedback to test the evolutionary links between quasars and galaxy formation, and 2) pursue an exciting new avenue of public outreach based on the sonification of astronomical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quarks and gluons are the most fundamental building blocks of normal matter. However, due to the nuclear strong force, they cannot be observed individually and are confined within particles like protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Under extreme temperatures and densities, a new state of matter known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) can be formed. The QGP is an excellent test bed for the theory of the strong force. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is one of two facilities world-wide capable of creating the QGP. In addition to producing the QGP, heavy ion collisions produce energetic quarks and gluons that interact with the QGP and then produce a spray of particles called a ""jet"" that can be measured with detectors. While previous RHIC experiments have shown evidence of jet energy loss, a new experiment called sPHENIX will enable precise measurements of fully reconstructed jets. sPHENIX includes a special detector, the first central hadronic calorimeter (HCal) at RHIC, which is essential for measuring the energy of these jets. In addition to jet related analyses, this award includes testing HCal components with cosmic rays before assembly and development of a calibration procedure for this novel detector.<br/><br/>Working with the sPHENIX HCal will provide opportunities for the diverse population of undergraduates at GSU to gain experience in research and hardware. The undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will be trained to work in big data analysis, network within large collaborations and develop useful hardware skills that are all important for preparing the next generation in a variety of STEM fields. Using components similar to those for the sPHENIX HCal, GSU students will work with Atlanta area middle and high school students to measure cosmic rays. Participation of the GSU Women in Physics student organization, for which the PI is the advisor, allows the middle and high school students to engage in science and work with a diverse group of scientists at a critical time when students are choosing career paths and is intended to help encourage a diverse population to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The sPHENIX hadronic calorimeter has a novel tilted plate design, which includes scintillator tiles embedded between steel plates. This award includes the development of a calibration procedure for this novel detector, which will be essential for successful measurements. Testing the scintillator tiles with cosmic rays will provide baseline calibration information and experience from the beam test prototype will be useful in developing the calibration procedure, which ultimately may include using photon tagged jets in p+p collisions to set the jet energy scale. Photon tagged jets are also important probes of the QGP. Since the photon is unmodified by the QGP, the photon's energy provides access to the initial parton energy of the opposing jet and therefore access to how much energy was lost. In parallel to sPHENIX preparations, this project will make the most precise photon tagged correlation measurements achievable from the 16 years of PHENIX data. These correlation measurements access the transport coefficient, q-hat, which measures the energy loss of partons per unit pathlength. Jet structure measurements give further insight to the fragmentation and energy loss of the partons in the medium. sPHENIX will enable new jet observables at RHIC that will advance our understanding of energy loss mechanisms in the QGP and thereby further our understanding of QCD under extreme conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic world, where atoms and electrons behave in ways that defy intuition. It also describes macroscopic phases of matter where many particles form a collective quantum state. However, quantum properties are generally obscured at high temperatures and away from a stationary equilibrium state, a situation that occurs in real systems that are in practice almost never isolated from external perturbations. On the other hand, true applications of quantum mechanics require harnessing such properties in large systems that can be manipulated away from equilibrium.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to identify situations where ""quantumness"" persists far from a stationary state at very low temperatures. The PI will identify the collective behavior of many particles away from equilibrium and will identify the degree to which their behavior is universal, i.e. independent of the individual system's particularities.<br/><br/>The proposed research will help identify new avenues to control quantum systems and to protect their quantum features far from equilibrium, a direction that could be useful for quantum memory and quantum computing applications. To engage the broader public, the PI is planning a series of workshops called ""Schroedinger's Cat is in Town!"" in partnership with Michigan-based physicists and local artists from the Michigan State University Museum Art Lab. These workshops will engage the public in an interactive setting and will also involve creating art based on physics concepts.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Recent experimental advances have opened a window to a new era of nonequilibrium quantum phenomena. They have also posed a great challenge to our descriptive capabilities as most of the familiar tools in physics are specifically designed for systems under equilibrium conditions. While nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems hold promise for new and exciting possibilities stemming from their quantum nature, they often end up exhibiting an effective classical behavior. This significantly limits the range of the quantum domain and in fact restricts it to unperturbed platforms at low temperatures. The issue is especially acute for critical behavior emerging near phase transitions: nonequilibrium quantum systems have not matched, or contributed much beyond, the grand triumph of understanding critical phenomena in classical systems.<br/><br/>This award supports an integrated research, education, and outreach program focused on the dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems far from equilibrium. The PI aims to significantly broaden the existing perspective by identifying situations where a genuinely nonequilibrium, quantum behavior emerges. This will be achieved in four settings of long- and short-time dynamics in both isolated quantum systems after a sudden change of system parameters, as well as in open quantum systems that are continuously driven. The goal is to discover novel dynamical and quantum universality classes with no counterpart in equilibrium. A specific aim of this proposal is to develop a unified framework in the different settings of isolated and open quantum systems.<br/><br/>The proposed research will help identify new avenues to control quantum systems and to protect their quantum features far from equilibrium, a direction that could be useful for applications in storaging and processing of quantum information.

One can think of a hydrogel as a three dimensional ""fishnet"" consisting of gelatin molecular chains (network) swollen by water drawn into the net.     Hydrogels have many current applications such as contact lenses and as scaffolding materials for tissue engineering.  Potential future applications may include artificial cartilage and ""muscles"" for soft robots.  A shortcoming of simple hydrogels is that they are easy to fail; this severely limits their practical use in load bearing components.   In recent years, chemists have invented hydrogels that are highly resistant to fracture.   The network of this new class of hydrogels consists of molecular chains linked to each other by different types of connectors (bonds).   These connectors can be permanent or temporary.   Temporary connectors can break and reform.   This process dissipates energy which contributes to resistance to fracture and they also allow the gel to heal.  Currently, engineers do not have the predictive tools to determine how components made of these hydrogels change shape under load and when they break.  This project will develop such predictive tools.  The end product will be a quantitative method and a computer code which allows engineers to design and analyze components made of these hydrogels.   <br/><br/>Two long standing problems in the time dependent mechanics of deformation and fracture of soft materials are: (1) three dimensional large deformation nonlinear viscoelasticity and (2) efficient integration of these three dimensional nonlinear viscoelastic equations.  A new idea to be explored by this research is that nonlinear viscoelasticity shields the crack from high stresses and thus enhances toughness.   This project will address these issues by: (a) performing experiments on a tough Polyampholyte hydrogel, (b) developing quantitative models relating nonlinear viscoelastic behavior to bond breaking and reformation kinetics, (c) developing experimental methods to discover and to quantify crack shielding and (d) developing efficient time integration schemes to solve the nonlinear viscoelastic equations.

One region where this interdependency is clear is the intermountain western United States, where cities (e.g. Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Boise, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, etc.) dot vast landscapes containing isolated rural communities. The urban systems depend on their hinterlands for drinking water supplies, energy generation, food production, and other ecosystem services.

To be concrete, this project proposes to use a wait-for graph and an interpretive cumulative distribution function (CDF) to identify and present bottlenecks related to throughput and latency respectively, which are the most widely used performance metrics.  It will further investigate how to scale these mechanisms to large and long-running systems.<br/><br/>If successful, this project has the potential for significant real-world impact, because first, performance analysis is a routine procedure in both industry and academia, and second, clarifying experimenter bias would allow our community to better evaluate a research work. This project will further provide materials to educate students in a variety of programs, including undergraduate and graduate operating systems courses in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, new projects in the Department of Analytics, and new projects at the Ohio Hackathon (targeting undergraduate and high school students).<br/><br/>All versions of data, including program source code, papers, trace data, and other documentation will be maintained in a data repository at the Ohio State University using a versioning infrastructure, with periodic back up.

In both cases, there is a pressing need for a quantitative understanding of how nanoparticles interact with biological systems. This research will generate a library of protein-nanoparticle interactions using a carefully controlled set of nanoparticles. Experiments will focus on the interaction of nanoparticles with the proteins found in the blood stream. Use of a robot to automate experiments will increase throughput and reproducibility. The research team will use this library, which will be publicly available, to determine which proteins adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles as a function of nanoparticle diameter and surface properties and then use this library for subsequent cell-nanoparticle experiments. A major limit to generating a protein-nanoparticle library has been the cost associated with protein analysis. The research team will benchmark the use of a faster, less expensive, protein separation method to reduce costs. The use of controlled nanoparticle parameters, in combination with automated sample preparation and low-cost protein analysis, will enable the first quantitative understanding of protein-nanoparticle interactions, important for environmental and industrial nanoparticle exposure, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic applications. This research also provides an ideal training platform for students to address fundamental questions of nanoscience with advances in research automation, training that will be relevant to future academic or industry jobs.<br/><br/>Nanoparticles used in any biological system proteins are exposed to proteins that adsorb on the surface of the nanoparticle forming a protein corona. Modification with neutral polymers can reduce this protein corona, but complete inhibition remains a challenge. Currently lacking is an ability to predict which proteins will adsorb on the surface of a specific nanoparticle.  Previous work in this area has been limited by the cost of proteomics, only identifying protein-nanoparticles interactions for small sets of nanoparticles, or have carried out large-scale proteomics on a diverse array of ligands that preclude the identification of trends. This research will generate a protein corona library and then use this library to select nanoparticles for protein- and cellular-level mechanistic studies. To generate sufficient nanoparticles with controlled variation of surface parameters, the research team will automate nanoparticle functionalization using a liquid handling robot. To reduce the costs associated with generating a protein corona library, the team will reduce the time required for peptide separation using capillary electrophoresis instead of liquid chromatography. The corona library will be used to select nanoparticles for mechanistic studies to understand why complement C3 and serum albumin are enriched and under-represented, respectively, in protein coronas, and the effect of these proteins on the subsequent interaction with macrophage cells. The outcomes of this research include the protein corona library, which will be publicly available, automation of nanoparticle functionalization and sample preparation, and a detailed comparison of capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography separation for proteomics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some cases, insect herbivores also alter the developmental and physiological programs of their host-plants, which cause the plants to produce more tissue for the benefit of the insect. The mechanisms by which insects cause these plant responses and the pathways by which insects evolved these remarkable abilities are largely unknown. This project will examine the evolution of these complex plant-herbivore interactions using the gall-wasp family, Cynipidae, as a model system. This family contains thousands of species that manipulate host-plants to create tumor-like structures, called galls, in which wasp larvae feed while being protected from predators and the outside environment. Galls vary tremendously in their architecture and location on the plant depending on the wasp species that initiated the gall. Researchers will generate genome-scale data to test how gall-wasps evolved the ability to make galls and how plant gall architecture has evolved over time. By examining the anatomy and physiology of these wasps, researchers will also shed light on how gall inducers are able to manipulate host-plants. The project will support the training of multiple early-career researchers, including members of underrepresented groups, and develop curricula that will improve insect biology education. Public outreach events will highlight the ecological and economic impact of insects in our society and will use the rich history of gall biology to engage diverse audiences. <br/><br/>The research team will resolve the evolutionary history of Cynipidae to determine whether gall induction evolved more than once in the family, establish whether viral or microbial symbionts are associated with galling, and determine how wasp species shifted among host-plant species over time. Researchers will reconstruct Cynipidae phylogeny using sequence data from 2,000 loci of ultra-conserved elements from more than 200 exemplar taxa, including every tribe and almost all genera. The evolution of gall induction strategies will be inferred from this tree using relevant meta-analyses, including ancestral states reconstruction, divergence time estimation, and comparative methods. Adult (venom) and larval (iliac, salivary) glands will be characterized for gross morphology, chemical composition, and transcriptomic profiles to uncover possible gall-inducing gene products, such as plant hormone mimics. Other outcomes of the research will include new diagnostic tools, expanded collections and genomic repositories, as well as a publicly-accessible database that will collate and synthesize historical gall-wasp research to accelerate description and discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer-aided simulation is a cost-friendly tool for the studies of these challenging interface problems. To approximate the governing mathematical equations of these systems, Virtual element method (VEM) is an emerging powerful tool in the scientific computing community. The objective of this research project is to develop both theoretical and practical aspects of various VEMs. Being able to reliably answer the question ""can we trust our simulation results?"" justifies the use of VEMs in simulating these complex systems. Meanwhile, this project strives to provide the public with a state-of-the-art VEM computer program that saves valuable computing resources. In addition, this research project creates opportunities to pass the torch on to graduate students to become the next generation computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>Solving elliptic partial differential equations with high-contrast diffusion coefficients play a central role in the modeling these complex systems. This project shall develop an in-depth robust a priori error analysis of VEM on elliptic interface problems. Different from the existing VEM analysis, this project devises a new novel paradigm to study the error analysis for the interface VEM, and further clarifies the dependence of the VEM convergence on the polytopal mesh geometries, justifying the VEM's applicability on interface-fitted mesh which may become extremely irregular or degenerate near the interfaces. Meanwhile, this project learns from the novelty of VEM framework to improve the analyses of traditional approaches for interface problems. The VEM's meta-formulation for elliptic problems enables us to construct immersed finite element spaces naturally in higher order and/or in 3-D.  Higher order interface VEMs, the a posteriori error estimation, and the adaptive polytopal mesh refinement are to be studied to render VEM more efficient and effective. This integrated study enables us to attack the challenging 3-D interface problems, which, in turn, broadens the scope in terms of both theory and tools for the whole numerical partial differential equation community. Last but not least, a portable and highly-vectorized VEM software library shall be made publicly available, including the semi-structured interface-fitted mesh generation, vectorized assembling, polytopal adaptivity, and fast multigrid solvers. The portability of the computer code enables the researchers to incorporate the VEM into existing software libraries dealing with interface problems, thus facilitating the interdisciplinary research in simulating those complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This viewpoint arises also in more abstract settings, such as decomposing a data set in a balanced way with linear equations to efficiently handle it, or evaluating a function in a fixed set of points to compute its integral. Note that if we introduce subjective preferences of the involved parties to our fair division problem, the inherent symmetries disappear. Again this loss of symmetry is a natural phenomenon for the class of the problems mentioned so far. This project develops methods to approach such problems, even in the absence of symmetry. Notably, the methods are topological, that is, continuous, whereas the problems have a combinatorial, or discrete, flavor. Thus this research builds bridges between different branches of mathematics, making problems in one branch amenable to the tools of another.<br/><br/>The PI will conduct research on a selection of combinatorial problems that benefit from a geometric viewpoint. Among the themes of research are intersection patterns of sets, both in a purely combinatorial setting (such as hypergraph matchings and design theory) as well as in geometric settings (such as intersections of convex sets and non-embeddability of complexes into Euclidean space), and the study of structured sets in abelian groups (such as sumsets, the structure of sets containing zero-sums, and spherical designs). These are problems, where one is interested in constructing an object or showing its non-existence, but global obstructions emerge---local solutions do not glue together to form the desired object. Geometry and topology provide a suitable framework to organize these non-local phenomena and detect such obstructions in the large.

It turns out that also many problems in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical systems.

Their applications include several areas of Federal strategic interest: materials and manufacturing, biomedical engineering and biotechnology, structural engineering and civil infrastructure, environmental engineering, and more. They are widely used by scientists and engineers in academia, industry, and national laboratories to simulate large, complex physical systems. These physical systems often obey ""conservation laws,"" which state that some quantity -- like mass, or energy, or electric charge -- can move around in space, but cannot appear or disappear spontaneously. It is desirable that simulations of these systems also obey these conservation laws, because they are so fundamental; otherwise, the simulated results may not be physically meaningful or trustworthy. However, this is not always the case with current methods. In this project, the PI will develop and analyze finite element methods that obey these conservation laws and preserve related physical properties. The success of this project would lead to new computational methods and improved understanding of current methods for a wide variety of scientific applications. Because the specific applications addressed by the proposed research are of high scientific value, this could have important ramifications for computational physics and engineering.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to investigate structure-preserving hybrid finite element methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) containing local symmetries, invariants, and conservation laws. In applications, these locally-invariant geometric structures often have important physical meaning (e.g., conservation of charge in electromagnetics), so it is desirable to devise conservative numerical methods that preserve these structures exactly rather than approximately. Hybrid methods provide a natural framework for this, since one may examine local invariants, element-by-element, in terms of numerical traces and fluxes on their boundaries. The proposed research consists of two main components. (1) Hamiltonian PDEs, which are ubiquitous in physical applications, satisfy the multisymplectic conservation law, which is closely tied to physically-important reciprocity phenomena, traveling waves, dispersion relations, and bifurcations. The PI will extend his recent joint work on multisymplectic hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for spatial discretization to time-evolution problems, using spatial HDG semidiscretization and spacetime HDG methods. (2) While the time evolution of Maxwell's equations automatically preserves a divergence constraint associated with charge conservation, this is generally not true for finite element discretizations. Preliminary results show that this can be resolved using a class of hybrid methods, where charge conservation holds in the sense of the numerical electric flux. The PI proposes to extend this by analyzing nonconforming hybrid methods for the Maxwell eigenvalue problem, as well as hybrid methods for Yang-Mills theory using finite element exterior calculus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Power management is increasingly important to the battery lifetime and thermal management of mobile systems whose computational heart, a system-on-a-chip (SoC), often integrates tens and hundreds of components and billions of transistors. Existing systems reply on device drivers for runtime PM.  A device driver is a software program that controls a particular type of hardware device attached to a computer.   This approach to PM not only leads to unoptimized, or often complete absence of runtime PM in widely used mobile systems, but also incurs high overhead by engaging the high-power central processing unit (CPU). The goal of this project is to relieve device drivers and the CPU of runtime PM by completely rethinking runtime PM of mobile SoCs. First, it will investigate a novel architecture in which a single operating system entity reasons whether a SoC component is idle without involving its device driver.  Second, the project will contribute to operating system support such that the runtime PM logic can be entirely realized on an ultra-low-power computing core available in modern mobile systems. The project will prototype and evaluate its technical innovations with Android/Linux-based testbeds and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based SoC prototyping hardware.<br/><br/>The project will leverage collaborations with industry leaders to ensure a timely transfer of technologies into industry and a broad impact on the commercial development of mobile systems and their SoCs.

Then, greenhouse experiments will be used to disentangle the role of differences in the soil microbes from differences in soil properties (and the interaction between the two) in governing plant fitness. The second component of the project will combine bioassays determining the effect of soil microbes on plant demographic parameters with existing long-term datasets to examine the demographic pathways and ecological contexts that allow microbes to influence plant population and metapopulation dynamics. This approach will use integral projection modeling to integrate microbial effects and patch-specific environmental parameters to understand the mechanistic basis for the distribution of 11 plant species across a patchy landscape. The final component will incorporate next-generation sequencing of soil microbiomes from ~700 sites into plant species distribution models to examine the relative importance of microbial and abiotic factors in determining the distributions of all ~80 members of the local plant community.

While there have been many advances in parallel software for such multicore chips over the past decade, there is still no satisfactory model for analyzing the performance of parallel algorithms.  In particular, and unlike the case for sequential algorithms, there is a gap between cost models for estimating performance of algorithms and easy to use programming models for implementing the algorithms.  This project is developing a practical approach to parallel algorithms by bringing together two fundamental but distinct theories of computing---one based on machine models and following the work that dates back to Dr. Alan Turing, and the other based on language models and following the work that dates back to Dr. Alonzo Church.  The novelty of the project is in combining these two theories, for which there is currently a large rift.  The impact of the project is in making significant steps in simplifying the design and analysis of parallel algorithms, and better understanding of the relationship between the two theories of computing. The educational component of this project involves teaching undergraduates parallel algorithms and creates ample opportunities to test the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach, along with concrete efforts to broaden participation in computing through programs at Carnegie-Mellon University.<br/><br/>The work is following an end-to-end methodology bridging Church and Turing's theories along with practice.  On the theory side, the project is developing a calculus called the ``algorithmic lambda-calculus,'' that equips Church's lambda-calculus with a cost semantics, making it possible to reason about the total work and parallel span (time) of programs, which in turn can be used to understand the performance of algorithms, at least asymptotically.  To show that this calculus is realizable, the project is theoretically establishing that the calculus is faithful to a transition semantics, which can then be efficiently realized on an abstract machine such as the Parallel-RAM.  On the practical side, the project is developing a programming language and a compiler that faithfully implements this theory.  The project is also extending the algorithmic lambda-calculus, the realizability theorems, and the implementation to support important features such as aggregate parallel data structures, interaction, and different forms of parallelism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, there has been a significant effort to detect this small molecule via instrumentation and with molecular recognition. While these efforts have led to some sensitive approaches for ethylene detection, methods for detecting ethylene in complex environments (such as inside a plant cell) do not currently exist. In this project, Professor Michel of the University of Denver is developing new small molecule probes that increase fluorescence upon reaction with ethylene. An understanding of the relationship between the structure of the probe and its signaling property in a specific environment are critical to the sensitive detection of ethylene. Fluorescent and color-producing probes have the unique ability to produce color within otherwise invisible chemical processes. This research is being developed into an integrated lecture-lab module for undergraduate organic students to provide context to underrepresented topics. Professor Michel develops outreach demonstrations at local high schools. Due to the desire to understand and control ethylene in the fruit supply chain, this research may have a broader impact on society by increasing the understanding of the molecular roles of ethylene in the ripening processes; thereby preventing premature food spoilage and reducing agricultural waste. Further, the graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are underrepresented minorities who are gaining a unique skill set due to the interdisciplinary nature of this project. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michel of the University of Denver is developing new small molecule fluorescent probes for the detection of ethylene. Due to the relatively small and unreactive nature of ethylene under the confined conditions of living systems, an organometallic-based approach is being developed, which requires a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the ligands bound to the metal center and stoichiometric reactivity with ethylene. This research determines the optimal probes for a particular application, such as the detection of ethylene in relevant biological systems including A. thaliana and E. coli. Detection of ethylene in these organisms is being investigated with probe modifications tailored to the specific goals and challenges presented by these systems.

There are many other ways they protect themselves, too. Ecologists have wondered for a long time why different species of plants adopt very different strategies of protection. Why wouldn't there be one best way? Even different individuals of the same species defend themselves differently.  Thus, a major challenge in ecology is to figure out the causes and consequences of differences in plant defense.  One idea is that plants in places where they can't grow fast, can invest more energy in defense.  In contrast, plants in places with lots of water and nutrients can grow and reproduce quickly -- life is good, so they don't need as much defense. Scientists with this project will test that idea. They will look at how different individuals of the same species may change their strategies of defense when grown in stressful areas and areas of plenty. They will test how well the defenses work by measuring how tasty the plants are to insects. Results may reveal new strategies for protection of farm crops from insect pests. The researchers will involve high school and college students in the project, training them how to do science. Also, the public will be engaged through various natural history and conservation programs.<br/><br/>This project involves reciprocally transplanting six co-occurring native grassland plant species from populations replicated within eight high- and eight low-resource environments into common gardens located in each region. Resources (rainfall) will also be manipulated in a common garden located in the low-resource region to evaluate the extent to which responses of plant growth and defense to abiotic factors are plastic. Herbivore abundance and the impacts of herbivores on plant fitness (accessed via insect-reduction experiments) will be quantified within populations containing the focal species across the two resource regions. Collectively, these experiments will evaluate how the resource environment influences: 1) growth and defense (both tolerance and resistance) evolution and plasticity within species; 2) positive growth and defense correlations across populations, and 3) insect herbivore abundance and the impacts of herbivory on plant fitness. Ultimately, the multispecies approach employed will help to reconcile the different growth-defense relationships often observed among vs. within species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellow is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists, James D. Bever and Joy K. Ward at the University of Kansas. The research presented by the Fellow has the potential to broaden our understanding of soil microbes, as a counterbalance to atmospheric CO2 enrichment, especially in prairie ecosystems. In these habitats, monarch butterflies depend on milkweed for carbon-based chemical extracts that protect them from predators and may also have implications for cancer therapy. However, little is known as to how these carbon-based chemical extracts, termed cardenolides, may be altered in response to increase in CO2 influx. These changes may have consequences on monarch survival and food-web structure. Understanding how soil microbes may help mitigate outcomes of atmospheric CO2 enrichment, could provide insight into ecosystem sustainability. The experiments being executed by the Fellow also allow for training of undergraduates, including TRIO McNair Scholars at the University of Kansas. <br/><br/>Under growth-chamber conditions, atmospheric CO2 will be manipulated for a broad range of native milkweed species, native AM-fungal species and a microbial control. Response variables, including milkweed chemical extracts, will be measured using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Examination of multi-trophic responses, including native milkweed quality, native monarch larval performance, and native AM-fungal colonization rates; will reveal how CO2 enrichment may impact plant-microbe-insect interactions. This project also affords an interdisciplinary approach for mentees seeking experience in environmental microbiology, global change biology or chemical ecology. Additionally, the Fellow can inspire mentees of similar origin, including first-generation Americans (Haitian-American), community college students, as well as minorities from the inner-city (Mattapan, Boston).

Dynamical systems (""dynamics,"" for short) is the study of motion, and in particular motion that is dictated by an unchanging set of rules, such as the Newtonian forces controlling mechanical motion.  Well-known experimental phenomena in dynamics such as chaotic trajectories combined with stable motion have been observed experimentally but are far from being fully understood from a theoretical perspective. The research will address the theoretical mechanisms behind chaotic motion in broad classes of dynamical systems, which include systems of both a physical and geometric nature.  Based on previous work of the principal investigator and her collaborators, the interplay between a numerical invariant called entropy and chaotic motion will be further understood. On the flip side, the principal investigator proposes several problems connecting entropy and related invariants with a phenomenon called rigidity.  Rigidity occurs when quantitatively small changes to the rules guiding a system force fundamental qualitative changes in the resulting dynamics. Identifying the rigid systems is a first step toward classification of certain peculiar dynamical behaviors observed in physical and geometric systems. An important aspect of the project is to further interaction between mathematical and adjacent scientific communities, such as physics.  The principal investigator has already collaborated in questions surrounding the design of particle accelerators and is currently collaborating with a physicist studying the quantum dynamics behind the emergence of black holes.  Furthermore, the principal investigator has given several public lectures on dynamics and has written in the popular press about the work of mathematicians. She proposes to expand these activities in the coming years.<br/><br/>Dynamics is the study of systems (for example, a state space for a physical process) that evolve over time according to a deterministic set of rules.  Well-studied classes of such dynamical systems include the so-called hyperbolic systems, which display chaotic, unpredictable features at every point, and KAM systems, which have stable regions of regular motion.  The partially hyperbolic systems are a more general class of dynamical systems than the hyperbolic class and include systems that combine hyperbolicity in some directions with KAM behavior in other directions.  Partially hyperbolic systems occur widely in dynamical systems arising in physics; for example, planetary motion usually contains partially hyperbolic sub-dynamics, and the effective construction of particle accelerators (used in biological imaging, as well as theoretical physics) requires a detailed understanding of both KAM and partially hyperbolic dynamics. The principal investigator has a well-developed research plan of over 15 years studying partially hyperbolic systems and is poised to raise the theory of these systems to a new level of generality and applicability.  The impacts of this research will be seen in future applications to systems of a concrete origin, in biology, physics and engineering.  The principal investigator is currently collaborating with the particle accelerator group at Fermilab to explore some of these potential applications. The research supported by this award is guided by the far-reaching goal of developing a general theory of partially hyperbolic systems along the lines of the hyperbolic theory developed in the past 40 years.  In particular the principal investigator proposes to study: ergodic properties of conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; actions of large collections of diffeomorphisms and embeddings on manifolds; and rigidity phenomena in actions of groups.  A highlight of the proposed research is to investigate the interaction between hyperbolicity and KAM phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In short, solar energy is delivering on its promise of over 60 years as a source of low cost, clean and literally infinitely renewable energy. However, basing all solar solutions on this single materials system is still far from an optimal solution. To be impactful, new solutions must have the objective of making solar power generation a ubiquitous presence, ultimately filling all of our ever-expanding energy needs. Recently there have been dramatic increases in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) that have led to the demonstration of >15% solar power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in cells containing new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and unusual combinations of liquid and solution-processed organic and metallic materials that leverage our increased understanding of charge and exciton transport in films with heterogeneous phases at the nanometer scale. The primary impact of the research will be to understand and improve OPVs to ultimately provide ultralow cost solar power in situations where established, mature solar technologies are less effective, such as in solar power generating windows and building-integrated photovoltaics, and generation at very low light levels to scavenge waste illumination power. The project will support the education of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students in experimental and material design and synthesis, spectroscopic measurement, data-taking and analysis, and scientific communication. The PIs will seek to host a Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) at the University of Michigan in 2021. They will also develop strong ties to local minority serving institutions to give seminars and short lectures discussing state of the art OPV design and spectroscopic measurements.<br/><br/>The project will combine extensive expertise in OPV design and characterization with state-of-the-art and emerging multidimensional coherent spectroscopies (MDCS) to understand the energy loss mechanisms that currently limit single junction OPV device efficiencies. The research aims to improve our  fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing charge and excited state transport and sources of energy loss in NFA-based OPVs. This will be facilitated by the development and use of new spectroscopic and visualization tools that can precisely quantify, on femtosecond - second time scales across the UV and into the infrared, the dynamics of photogenerated charge transfer across heterogeneous interfaces and transport away from their points of origin. The principles derived from these fundamental studies will provide molecular design rules to guide the improvement of NFA-based OPVs towards their thermodynamically limited efficiencies of ~25%.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The origins of inequality in ancient societies is a central concern in anthropological archaeology with significant implications for wider understanding of inequality in today's world.   Previous research has documented conditions under which persistent institutionalized inequalities are likely to develop.  These include the presence of defensible subsistence resources and the possibility for inter-generational transmission of wealth, access to wealth, and rights to wealth.  Debate continues regarding the historical processes that give rise to material inequality with some reseachers asserting inequality to be an inevitable outcome of inherent human striving for personal economic and reproductive success under conditions of resource abundance versus others who argue that inequality is an unintended byproduct of competitive conditions during periods of resource shortfall.  Archaeology is poised to offer significant contributions to these discussions given the ability to reconstruct social evolutionary process over lengthy time spans.

The artificial layered compounds (ALC) consist of 4 to 7 elements tailored atomic layer by atomic layer thus forming nanoscale chemical compounds that are not available in nature or by other known synthesis methods. They correspond to a new archetype of ferromagnetic materials, which can be engineered to possess novel tunable electronic and magnetic functionalities desired for future quantum information technologies. The research will be focused on exploring the synthesis and characterization of the ALC, investigating the atomic scale structures, and probing the electronic and magnetic properties. The objectives are to realize the ALC with the desired properties and functionalities, elucidate the nature and interplay between structures and properties, and develop means to control and fine-tune these properties through atomic scale synthesis. The potential impact is significant, because the work can establish a pathway for realizing and controlling the electronic and magnetic effects in a new class of materials. The work will not only explore novel materials that can be readily integrated into today's silicon-based technologies, but also can lead to general understanding of the fundamental processes in these complex artificial materials. Education is another key objective of the work. Students will be trained in a wide range of interdisciplinary cutting-edge activities from synthesis to characterization, while the individuals will specialize in several state-of-the-art techniques. These areas are of critical importance scientifically and technologically, especially for future advanced technologies, and in order to maintain the leadership role of the US in these areas, investments in human resources and expertise are critically needed. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The project is to investigate novel MBE synthesis and characterization of ultra-short-period (USP) superlattices (SLs) consisting of half-metallic and semiconducting Heusler compounds on Si/Ge substrates. USP (defined as one to two primitive-cell size of the constituent compounds) corresponds to a new archetype of ferromagnetic SLs. Such an archetype enables non-equilibrium engineering of band structures and interfacial states but has not been explored experimentally. The aim is to realize more robust and tunable ferromagnetic half-metals (HMs) accompanied by a large and tunable uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). This combination of functionalities and tunability is not present in any currently known materials but is extremely desirable for future quantum information technologies. The research will be focused on exploring the MBE synthesis and characterization, investigating the structural and chemical order, and probing the electronic states, spin polarization, and magnetism. The objectives are to realize robust and tunable ferromagnetic HMs in SLs with at least one non-HM constituent, and elucidate the nature of the minority spin gap and related phenomena, realize PMA in the all Heusler SLs, and elucidate the nature and interplay between structure, magnetism, and interfacial states, and develop means to control and fine-tune spin-dependent states and magnetic anisotropy. The potential impact of the work is significant, because it can establish a pathway for realizing and controlling spin polarized effects and magnetism in Si-compatible epitaxial systems. The work will not only explore novel spin polarized materials that can be readily integrated onto Si-based platform, but also can lead to general understanding of fundamental processes in these complex artificial materials. Education is another key objective of the work. Students will be trained in a wide range of interdisciplinary activities from synthesis to characterization, while the individuals will specialize in several advanced techniques.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research aims to increase understanding of the role of mitochondria (the organelle responsible for a majority of the cell's energy) in mediating animal's stress responses to changing environments and mode of reproduction. Some animals reproduce by making clones of themselves while others reproduce by mating with other individuals. The conditions under which an animal switches from making clones of itself to mating as a form of reproduction has been linked to environmental stress. Excessive environmental stress can damage an animal's cells and DNA. In an evolutionary context, mating is a means to repair DNA damage as well as to create new genes that will allow for adaptation to the environment. This work will study how the mitochondria are involved in this process. In addition to the work proposed to study mitochondria, the fellow has developed the Science Training and Education Program: Increasing The participation of Under-represented Populations (STEP IT UP) to promote and provide equitable access to a career in biological science. STEP IT UP focuses on first generation and racial minority students who may be denied research opportunities because of their grades or test scores alone. The fellow will recruit students through STEP IT UP to increase representation of underrepresented groups in biology.<br/><br/>This project will investigate mitochondrial characteristics of the sea-starlet anemone, Nematostella vectensis, which is facultatively mating organism and has AOX. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is typically depicted as having two entry points and one exit for electrons. However, many facultative animals have a second exit, called the alternative oxidase (AOX). This work proposes that AOX protects cells from free radical damage during environmental stress and that through this protection, AOX allows for the clonal mode of reproduction under a wider breadth of environmental conditions. AOX maintains mitochondrial function under cellular stress conditions while keeping free radicals below levels that cause damage to DNA. Chemical inhibition of AOX and genetic knockout lineages will be created to test how environmental stress, free radicals, and AOX interact to determine mode of reproduction. The fellow will conduct stress experiments using lineages with and without AOX, then measure the point at which gametogenesis occurs. If AOX plays a role in mediating the switch to a mating form of reproduction, AOX knockout lineages should produce more free radicals and switch reproduction mode at a lower stress threshold than wild type lineages. AOX may play a role in other evolutionary processes such as DNA mutation rates, local adaptation, and speciation. STEP IT UP participants from under-represented groups in Texas will receive training in bioinformatics, molecular biology, and evolutionary biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sediment transport predictions are also used to help restore rivers for numerous aquatic species. Despite its importance, sediment transport is notoriously difficult to predict, and this project will investigate how changes in river bed structure (e.g. rock arrangement) influences sediment transport. Such information will then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. Through a collaboration with artists, sculptures will be temporarily placed in rivers to serve as 1) flow obstructions (e.g. boulders and wood) that provide habitat for a range of fish species, and 2) public outreach installations through signs posted near the sculptures with links to websites containing information and videos about the science of this project. <br/><br/>Errors in sediment transport predictions can be partly explained by the common assumption that the onset of sediment motion always occurs at the same flow magnitude in a given river. Large temporal changes in the onset of sediment motion can occur because of variations in the channel bed structure. The goals of this proposal are to better understand these temporal changes in bed structure and to use this understanding to accurately predict the onset of sediment motion.  Laboratory experiments and a mechanistic theory are used to identify and quantify the channel bed parameters that control variations in the onset of sediment motion.

While there has been increasing attention to exploring biocompatible and biodegradable materials for implantable monitors and disposable epidermal sensors, the substrates are often associated with poor biodegradability, high surface roughness, lack of conformability, and expensive chemical synthesis approaches. In this project, various zinc sensors on the nature-derived galactomannan substrate will be fabricated, characterized, and benchmarked. The resulting disposable electronics can be programmed to dissolve in water, and further produce environmentally benign end-products, which can be used for alkaline soil amendments. Considering the numerous human health benefits such as reducing blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of the water-soluble galactomannan, the results from this study will also enable the future development of biomedical implants. Additionally, the research will be tightly coupled with a comprehensive educational program that will expose undergraduate and underrepresented students to interdisciplinary technologies through early engagement and research training on the design and fabrication of fully water-soluble sensors. <br/><br/>Significant efforts have been devoted to reducing the bending stiffness of epidermal devices to improve the contact quality at the device-skin interface and to yield high-quality sensing data. As the bending stiffness of the device is primarily affected by the modulus and thickness of each device layer, successful demonstrations include the use of low-modulus substrate or exploration of thin device structures. However, the materials are limited in the former, and low-cost fabrication is challenging in the latter. Additionally, non-water-soluble properties of both classes create electronic waste streams, posing environmental concerns. An innovative, fully water-soluble bioelectronic device is proposed in which zinc sensors are fabricated on the galactomannan substrate through a low-cost fabrication process. The objective of this project is to carry out a feasibility study that water-soluble bioelectronics on a skin-conforming galactomannan film can form a conformal contact with the hierarchically textured skin surface and reduce the contact impedance. Two research tasks are proposed to accomplish the feasibility study: (1) fabricating capacitive zinc electrodes and temperature sensors on the skin-conforming galactomannan films, and (2) characterizing water-soluble zinc sensors to benchmark their performance, particularly against motion artifacts. By following arbitrary skin deformations without mechanical failure, the new class of fully disposable, high-performance, and low-cost electronic devices can significantly improve the contact quality at the device-skin interface and reduce the susceptibility to motion artifacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This assumption implies an instantaneous dynamic balance between changes in the drivers at the ocean surface, and ocean flow throughout the ocean (so-called steady-state equilibrium solutions). Numerical models show that the deep ocean adjustment to changes at the surface are not instantaneous, and can take many millennia, suggesting that the steady-state equilibrium approach required for theoretical studies can miss ocean responses occurring at decadal to millennial time-scales. This could have a significant impact on understanding ocean overturning circulation, and affect our ability to make accurate climate predictions. A suite of models will be developed that accounts for the time required for the ocean to respond to changes in wind forcing over these long, climate relevant time-scales. These models will be used to gain deeper insights into each of the most essential mechanisms that control changes in the ocean overturning circulation, and their combined effects. The suite  will be disseminated online as open source software, and will provide researchers and students with an interactive computing experience to help them build an intuitive understanding of ocean dynamics. At the same time, it will foster the development of modern computational skills to students, something increasingly important in both research and industry. The project will train two graduate students as well as two undergraduate interns from underrepresented minorities. In addition, the project will engage with high-school students and introduce them to ocean and climate science - helping to entrain the next generation of scientists into this field.<br/> <br/>This project will develop a theoretical understanding of the nonequilibrium ocean response to changes in climate on time-scales from decades to millennia. It aims at closing the gap between observations and numerical modelling studies which demonstrate transient responses to be different than those obtained using equilibrium solutions. The proposed research focuses on two specific problems that have received wide attention in the literature, but the expectation is that the developed theoretical framework will eventually be applicable to a much wider range of questions about the ocean's role in past and future climate change. The first question addresses the time-scale dependent response of the ocean state and circulation to changes in the wind stress over the Southern Ocean. The second question addresses the ocean's time-dependent response to global warming, with applications to both anthropogenic climate change as well as glacial-interglacial climate transitions. The investigation will use a hierarchy of models of varying complexity to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the deep ocean's response to changes in the surface boundary conditions on time-scales from decades to millennia. A particular focus will be on the development of a simple model suite for the overturning circulation, which will be incorporated both in the research and educational component of this proposal.  The model suite will be set up in Python for use on a laptop computer and will allow deeper insight into the most essential mechanisms that control changes in the ocean overturning circulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate students, increasingly including members of underrepresented groups through Williams's need-blind admissions policy, have been intimately connected with the eclipse expeditions and the associated data reduction and analysis; this project enables the active involvement and training of students to continue. Specifically, this proposal is to perform high resolution optical observations, rapid imaging of the corona, and radio and spectroscopic measurements. The project will include comparisons with other space and ground based observations as well as comparisons with state of the art computer models. <br/><br/>This particular project is to take advantage of the data from the 2017 total solar eclipse and to observe the 2019 and 2020 total eclipses. The focus of the project is on observing the white-light corona and working with highly processed images that bring out detail and extreme contrast. This will allow improved measurements of dynamics of coronal plumes and other coronal features, especially coronal mass ejections. Additionally, filtergrams and spectra of the green-line (Fe XIV) and red-line (Fe X) coronas will be used to examine the contrast of regions of different temperatures.

They are also bellwethers for change in the landscape. However, a question of fundamental importance for national interest is how river systems respond to major environmental changes. Predicting how changes in environmental conditions affect river processes, such as flooding and erosion, is critical for water resource management. This project uses knowledge of the past as a key to better inform the present through examining ~35 million year old sediments from an ancient river network in western Nebraska and South Dakota to quantify how changes in precipitation, vegetation and temperature in the past caused changes in river discharge and flood magnitude. These data, integrated with hydraulic models, will improve our ability to predict how rivers flood, sediment is transported and catchments evolve. Results of this work will have far reaching implications for understanding, modeling and planning for changes to river systems in the future. Three key broader impacts of this study include: 1) support of graduate and undergraduate students to develop interdisciplinary expertise; 2) sharing of data, methods and results as teaching data-sets on open-access platforms; 3) science outreach modules for children to explore 3-dimensional rock outcrops and animations from computational models. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to reconstruct the coevolution of paleoriver and ecosystems dynamics with environmental change in western North America during the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), perhaps the largest climate state change of the last 65 million years.

To achieve the project goals a team of geochemists, sedimentologists and hydraulic engineers will develop an integrated approach to understanding how rivers respond to environmental change. Success in this cross-disciplinary approach could provide a paradigm shift in utilizing modern and ancient terrestrial geologic archives to quantify environmental perturbations that manifest in the hydraulics, morphodynamics and regional ecosystem responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the necessity for structures tailored to the target application, fundamental challenges remain in preparing nanoporous materials at the same level of precision achieved in small-molecule design. A relatively new class of materials, called covalent organic frameworks, uses rigid molecular building-blocks that self-assemble into predictable, crystalline porous architectures. Planar starting molecules form two-dimensional (2D) polymer sheets that stack to give lightweight materials with uniform, nanometer-sized pores and high surface areas. While there is broad control over the individual sheet structure, there has been little advancement in controlling the stacking between layers and the corresponding material stability. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, aims to bridge a gap in the knowledge of covalent framework growth by controlling the interlayer structure between the 2D sheets. Trapping framework building-blocks in charged, cage-like host molecules disrupts the default interlayer stacking, allowing for the formation of modular jacketed covalent frameworks. With this award, the principle investigators and their groups study fundamental growth mechanisms for this new type of covalent organic frameworks, which expands the knowledge required to grow better next-generation materials. These new materials, both ionic and porous, are expected to accelerate advancements in separations, conductivity in electronic devices, and catalysis. This research is undertaken with a diverse group of undergraduates and masters students at Bucknell University, preparing them for future careers in the STEM fields, as well as providing opportunities to engage with the local community.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, explores a supramolecular approach for noncovalent functionalization of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs). In the past decade, COFs have shown that controllable crystalline organic structures are readily available through self-assembly of rigid monomers via reversible linkage chemistries. Despite their potential, 2D COFs are limited by their dependence on simple interlayer sheet stacking, which prevents manipulation in the z-dimension and inhibits access to interconnected pore networks. Introducing host-guest complexation between positively charged cage molecules and planar COF monomers facilitates the design of jacketed covalent organic frameworks (J-COFs). This platform of monomer encapsulation introduces control over both material structure and functionalization through counterion selection. In this project, the synthesis and growth mechanism of J-COFs are characterized across known COF linkage chemistries, such as boronate ester, imine, and hydrazone systems. Novel solid-state properties deriving from structural incorporation of the cage species are contrasted with standard 2D COFs. This project provides undergraduate and masters students greater exposure to materials chemistry concepts, including both research opportunities as well as direct engagement with local schools and the Lewisburg Children's Museum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This energy learning is the foundation for informed decision-making about sustainable and just use of energy resources. Energy issues are not only issues of science and technology, but must be integrated with civics, history, economics, sociology, psychology, and politics to understand and solve modern energy problems. Placing the scientific concept of energy in this social context presents an opportunity to advance science education as equitable and culturally responsive.    <br/><br/>This project will create a model for secondary science teacher professional development that integrates science concepts with equity education. This model promotes a key epistemological issue: that science concepts are not culture-free or socially neutral ideas, but rather are concepts created and sustained by people in specific times and places for the purposes of (1) addressing specific social needs and (2) empowering people or groups of people. The two major components of the project are (1) the professional development  experience, including both an intensive in-person summer workshop and an online professional learning community, and (2)an energy and equity portal, including an instructional materials library, an action research exchange, and a community forum for teacher discussions. The portal will provide technical resources to support the PLC, including support for sharing instructional materials and reporting on action research. The research plan includes exploratory, development and application phases. The researchers will identify teacher learning in the first iteration of PD, collect and analyze the instructional artifacts to inform how teacher engage with, participate in, and build an understanding energy as a historically and politically situated science concept. A team of scholar-videographers will observe, taking real-time field notes and making daily memos. The research team will use the instructional artifacts, video recordings, field notes, and memos as a basis for analysis through the next academic year. The result will be a nationally significant community of teacher-leaders and library of research-tested instructional materials that are responsive to students' scientific ideas, relevant to socio-political concerns about energy sustainability, respectful of students' cultures, and open to all students no matter their cultural background. Teachers participating in the project will learn to explain how scientific concepts of energy reflect culturally specific values, analyze socio-politically relevant energy scenarios, learn the historic and present-day inequities in the energy industry and in science participation, and be supported in preparing instruction for secondary students that is culturally responsive and relevant to their students' communities.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

While numerous fundamental physical property investigations and device demonstrations have been performed, there is still a significant knowledge gap in understanding how relevant processing and operation conditions such as structural confinement (encapsulation), high temperature and large current flows affect their structure and performance. Such conditions are commonly encountered during high performance device operation in modern microelectronics. Understanding these properties is therefore critical for understanding the alloying and doping, heterojunction and contact formation, as well as electrical and thermal failure. This project helps understand the fundamental thermodynamic processes and transformations that these materials undergo under extreme physical confinement and temperatures by direct visualization and spectroscopic analysis with an electron beam inside an electron microscope. These experiments are then coupled with nanoscale optical imaging techniques to correlate the structural transformations with optical and electronic property changes. These investigations advance our fundamental knowledge, and help frame design rules for synthesis, processing and device operation considerations.

A combination of near-field optical spectroscopy and in-situ transmission electron microscopy methods, combined with unique sample preparation on pre-patterned substrates are used to investigate the impact of structural confinement, current and temperature. The samples are prepared via mechanical exfoliaton and stacking, as well as via chemical vapor deposition growth. The work exploits the ability to layer atomically-thin layers of these chalcogenides and their vertical heterostructures and then encapsulate them in inert and refractory layers such as graphite or boron nitride. In addition, the ability to laterally stitch and grow in-plane heterostructures via chemical vapor deposition further permits investigation of in-plane diffusion and segregation upon passage of current or upon heating to elevated temperatures both with and without encapsulation. To investigate the structural evolution, high-frame rate image acquisition is used in-situ to produce quantitative data from electron micrograph images. Since the structural evolutions and in-homogeneities are expected to be on a sub-visible light wavelength scale, nanoscale, tip-enhanced optical photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy is used to correlate them with in-situ electron microscopy data. These experiments allow quantitative understanding of how 2D chalcogenides and their heterostructures evolve under physical confinement, high current density and high temperatures, all relevant for high-performance device operation. These experiments allow further assessment of the mechanisms of diffusion and phase transformations processes at these extreme conditions and their impact on optoelectronic performance which provides insight into strategies to engineer both materials and devices for robust and high performance operation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among non-volatile memory technologies, resistive random access memory based on metal oxide films as resistive switching layers has the potential for high-speed, low operation voltage, low power consumption, and good endurance properties that enable the highest performance at the lowest cost. However, metal oxide resistive random access memory also faces some critical challenges such as the unpredictable forming process. Another challenge is the variable resistive states from one film to another and from one point to another across each film. The collaborative project between the US team (Univ. at Buffalo and Purdue) and the UK team (Univ. of Cambridge) will develop a highly innovative, scalable, and advanced materials technology to overcome the current technical limitations of emerging resistive memory. The materials platform is HfO2, a widely used material in the semiconductor industry. Unlike previous work on this material, the current project will precisely engineer HfO2 microstructures in new ways to create highly controlled switching properties. The broader technological impacts are built on established industry collaborations. The research program is well integrated with education and outreach programs at all three campuses, including: 1) training young researchers with multidisciplinary research skills in an international research environment; 2) implementing resistive memory concepts in materials science and engineering curricula through teaching; 3) disseminating research findings to broader audiences through outreach programs.<br/><br/>While commonly-used metal/metal oxide/metal structures for resistive random access memory have conduction filaments that are nucleated randomly, the design in this project incorporates engineered vertical interfaces in either vertically aligned nanocomposite or fine-grained columnar structures to guide the conduction channels. These pre-defined interfaces enable the formation of precise and non-random vertical conducting paths with high densities for high performance resistive random access memory, without the need for a high voltage forming process. This project advances knowledge by combining well-integrated capabilities to synthesize, characterize, design, and fabricate resistive random access memory devices with targeted properties and performance. Specifically, it will translate the ideal engineered materials systems which has been already demonstrated by this team in epitaxial nanocomposites to simple binary oxides such as HfO2 on Si. These films will be initially grown by pulsed laser deposition. The knowledge learned from the films grown by pulsed laser deposition will be then implemented to industrial tools of sputtering and atomic layer deposition to achieve nanoengineered HfO2-based films with ~few nm sized columnar-grains. Finally, individual memristors and crossbar array structures will be fabricated, and the key parameters of the devices characterized. Furthermore, a set of unique characterization tools will be used to reveal the interplay between the device performance and the materials properties. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a forming-free, highly uniform, high density, low power, high on/off ratio, superior endurance resistive memory through the formation of controlled oxygen vacancy concentration and perfect conducting channels in resistive switching metal oxide layers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is mediated by proteins know as Release Factors, which promote release of newly synthesized polypeptide product from the ribosome. Release must be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of truncated or extended polypeptides that can be non-functional or even toxic to the cell. The goals of the current project are to elucidate the molecular mechanism implemented by the Release Factors during the fundamental biological process of termination of protein synthesis. This project will have a broad impact on the advancement of our understanding of biology at the molecular level.  Ultimately,  the mechanistic details of the ribosomal machinery to be determined can reveal new avenues for the development of antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosome.  In addition, the project will train both undergraduate and graduate students in powerful techniques in structural biology and introduce high school students to research at the forefront of structural and molecular biology. <br/><br/>All Release Factors (RF) share a universally conserved tripeptide sequence motif Gly-Gly-Gln (GGQ) that is critical for eliciting hydrolytic activity at the active site of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center. Despite a number of previous biochemical and structural studies, the exact molecular mechanism of how Release Factors promote hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA at the peptidyl transfer center  remains elusive. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed project is to uncover this yet undefined catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and answer the long-standing fundamental questions in the field:  how do release factors promote hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA in the ribosome and what is the contribution of the universally conserved GGQ tripeptide motif to this process? As part of this work, multiple crystal structures of pre-termination 70S-RF complexes will be determined.

Understanding specific interactions between carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding proteins has been a challenging task due to the lack of versatile probes.  Organic color centers created on nanomaterial hosts with precise optical and carbohydrate functionalities are uniquely suited to profile protein-carbohydrate recognition, which can lead to clarifying functions of both molecules and their underlying molecular mechanism and discovering therapeutic and diagnostic mechanism as well.  This project will promote the progress in science by advancing fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships of engineered organic color centers with biological functionalities and establishing the probing behavior of carbohydrate-functionalized color centers for specific biological targets in either physiological and pathological pathways.  In addition to advancing an emerging frontier across nanotechnology, chemistry, glycoscience, and engineering, this work will positively impact the well-being of society.  First, this work will contribute to the development of the next-generation multicolor fluorescent probes with precise functionalities for biomedical research and applications.  Second, this project will provide exciting opportunities to students of all backgrounds through promoting engaged learning via hands-on research in an evolving interdisciplinary field of nanomaterial science and technology and glycosciences.  It will further support the advancement of a broadly inclusive, next-generation science and engineering workforce, particularly in bio-nanotechnology.<br/><br/>This project will focus on probing specific interactions between carbohydrates and proteins by engineered organic color centers with the goal of achieving new nanomaterial tools to detect targeted molecular interactions in biological processes with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity.  The proposed color centers will be created through covalently functionalizing the sidewall of semiconducting, pure-chirality single-wall carbon nanotubes via oriented immobilization of glycopolymers that closely mimic the natural glycan structures and functions.  There are many advantages for the proposed color centers.  First, chirality-defined carbon nanotube hosts have defined structures and properties and color centers created on nanotubes further tune light in the near-infrared regime that has attenuated autofluorescence and deep tissue penetration, providing the ideal condition for high contrast fluorescence detection in complicated biological samples.  Second, pure-chirality carbon nanotubes promote advances in ultra-low dose, high efficiency nanomedicines.  Third, biomimetic, precision synthesized glycopolymers mimic the three-dimensional display of carbohydrates on the cell surfaces, thus warrant enhanced sensitivity and selectivity for proteins.  Particularly, the proposed work will involve i) synthesizing organic color centers using galactose-containing glycopolymers with different carbohydrate ligand densities, ii) determining how the galactose pendent groups of glycopolymers mediate the specific interaction of color centers with asialoglycoprotein receptor of human hepatoma cells, and iii) assessing the basal toxicity and functionality of organic color centers for selectively identifying human hepatoma cells utilizing both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell cultures.  Here, microarray three-dimensional bioprinting of cell cultures provides in vivo-like microenvironments to better asses the toxicity and selectivity of nanomaterials-based color centers, which could be used as biocompatible, cancer cell-targeting multicolor fluorescent probes.  Optical properties of engineered organic color centers and their specific interactions with proteins and human liver cancer cells will be characterized primarily by optical spectroscopy of color centers, high-content imaging assays, and near-infrared fluorescence imaging.  The combinatorial diversity of nanotube structure and glycopolymer configuration offers vast potential for chemical innovation and biochemical sensing and imaging advancement.  If successful, this work will provide a transformative approach to study the carbohydrate recognition in biology that is essential to uncover molecular mechanisms of many biological processes.  This work will also open up possibilities to create a new class of multicolor fluorescent probes with distinct properties that are previously never achieved for many applications, such as biosensing and bioimaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work is relevant to the economy of United States, the largest producer of chemical products globally. Chemical producers seek renewable starting materials.  They also seek to use abundant resources when possible.  Safety in a chemical process is a third consideration. These goals motivate research on chemical reactions that are environmentally friendly. Professor Abu-Omar's project uses cheap and abundant elements such as manganese and iron along with plant-based groups to form the new catalysts that in turn, speed up the desired reactions.  Detailed analyses of the rates of these chemical reactions give insights into how the catalyst works on an atomic level. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Abu-Omar is actively engaged in an outreach program involving community college (CC) students, who are largely from underrepresented groups, in laboratory research. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Mahdi Abu-Omar of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is designing and synthesizing catalysts based on first row transition metals, specifically manganese and iron.  These catalysts are further designed using lignin-based ligands (LBL). The synthesis of LBL is high yielding, atom economical, and satisfies many of the Principles of Green Chemistry. The design of LBL provides a motif that is highly suited for coordination chemistry but yet resistant to oxidative degradation. Iron- and manganese-LBL complexes are then employed to generate chlorine dioxide on-demand from chlorite in aqueous solution under ambient temperature and at neutral pH. A significant improvement in chlorine dioxide production is to avoid oxygen atom transfer (OAT) from the catalyst to chlorite to make chlorate, which is a persistent pollutant. Under investigation is the oxidation of phenanthrene and phenols (aromatic compounds) by in situ generated chlorine dioxide. In a unique approach, two catalytic cycles are coupled in tandem to achieve oxidations with dioxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is termed intramolecular (within the molecule) proton transfer and is a fundamental step in natural photosynthesis, as well as some energy conversion processes like hydrogen fuel generation from light energy.  Some important proton transfer processes occur extremely quickly, for example in less than two hundred femtoseconds (one quadrillionth of a second).  The rapidity of this process makes it difficult to measure, and to answer such questions as, ""how does the speed of intramolecular proton transfer depend on the structure of the molecule?"". To overcome this challenge, Professor Khalil is designing experimental tools that utilize a wide range of light wavelengths, from the infrared spectrum (long wavelengths that we feel as ""heat"") to X-rays (very short wavelengths).  These tools provide detailed information about the motions of electrons and atoms within molecules.  This research provides new information to develop more efficient molecules for converting light into chemical energy.  The effort also creates new femtosecond technologies and trains graduate students in cutting-edge optical techniques. Professor Khalil conducts an outreach program that includes a hands-on optics module for middle school girls from STEM-disadvantaged backgrounds.  This program is part of the ""Girls on Science"" program conducted through the University of Washington's Burke Museum.   <br/><br/>The first objective of this research program is to map the relationship between electronic excitation and vibrational motion in a series of intramolecular hydrogen-bonded complexes with different hydrogen bond strengths.  The second objective is to understand how a molecule shakes off excess energy after absorbing a photon (this happens in DNA complexes) as a function of the distance and angle between the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor.  The first two objectives are accomplished using advanced laser techniques developed in the Professor Khalil's laboratory.  The final goal is to map the electron distribution at the proton donor and acceptor sites with element specific soft X-ray spectroscopy.  The X-ray experiments are conducted at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA).  The broader impacts include an increased understanding of light-induced electron-proton transfer processes, which are important reactions in several natural and artificial energy conversion processes that may lead to the development of new molecules, materials and devices for alternative energy production.

For example, miniature robotic vehicles with flapping wings could be deployed to identify leaks in dense networks of pipes, to survey air quality, or even to artificially pollinate crops. Flapping wings could also be used to harvest energy and thus power a sensor network for specific applications. However, engineering tools are not sufficiently evolved to utilize flexible flapping wings for these emerging technologies. Methods currently used to predict the physics of flapping wings are inefficient, often requiring long time to estimate the performance of just a single flapping wing system. As such, they cannot be used for real-time control applications where the system must adapt rapidly to dynamic environmental conditions. The primary goal of this award is therefore to develop efficient and rapid experimental methods to predict the physics governing flapping flexible wings. Such methods will advance the design for flapping wing technologies. This award will support American Indian students recruited through Montana State University's EMPower program. It will also promote science, technology, engineering and math fields through public outreach activities including Montana State Family Science Day and National Biomechanics Day.  <br/><br/>This project specifically aims to realize a reduced-order fluid-structure interaction model of flapping wings.  Conventional fluid-structure interaction models rely on coupled finite element and computational fluid dynamics solvers, both which require considerable computational resources.  Existing low-order approaches are typically restricted to rigid wings and cannot account for the aerodynamic forces that result from elastic structural deformation.  The model developed through this work will deliver solution accuracy near that of high-fidelity solvers with the computational efficiency achieved by low-order methods.  This model will be applied to study both artificial wings as well as real insect wings and will be realized by accomplishing the following objectives.  First, wings will be geometrically, structurally, and aerodynamically characterized via a combination of micro-computed-tomography scans, computational fluid dynamics, experimental modal analysis, and model updating routines.  Second, the fluid-structure interaction framework will be derived using a novel deformable blade element momentum approach.  Deformed wing aerodynamics are accounted for e&#64259;ciently through a predetermined look-up table of coe&#64259;cients and dynamic correction factors that will be incorporated into the quasi-steady model as necessary. This low-order model will initially be benchmarked against direct high-fidelity computational simulation. Third, the model will be validated experimentally. A linkage mechanism will be used to generate flapping kinematics.  Wing strain, aerodynamic forces and torques will be measured and compared to theoretic predictions. The expected outcome of this project is a robust fluid-structure interaction framework capable of supporting real-time control as well as parametric design of flapping, flexible wing technologies.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by CBET-Fluid Dynamics, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and BIO-IOS programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Primary investigators (PIs) will develop a mathematical theory to understand the properties of such materials better, especially how to classify them and how to quantify their robustness to defects.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The fellow is investigating the environmental causes of recent decreases in animal body size. Across species and the globe, animal body size has decreased suggesting a response to some major environmental change occurring over the past 50-100 years.  This research clarifies what environmental factor is driving this decrease in body size by untangling the effects of two common factors known to affect animal body size, temperature and resource abundance. Additionally, while most studies have not considered if species have been responding genetically to climate change, this study sheds light on whether temperature or resource abundance is causing populations to evolve. Uncovering what pressures organisms are responding to and how they are responding is fundamental to our understanding of how organisms react to rapid environmental change and will affect conservation efforts.<br/><br/>The fellow is combining museum specimens of the native bee Ceratina calcarata from the past hundred years with climate and land use data to reconstruct how bee populations have responded to environmental change.  Since close populations have experienced similar temperature but different land use regimes, a proxy for local resource abundance, the fellow has the opportunity to uncouple the effect of temperature and resource abundance on body size. The fellow is tracking the temporal changes in body size among these populations to see if size correlates with the average yearly temperature or the local resource abundance. The fellow is also using comparative genomics of historical and recent populations to determine if temporal and spatial changes in gene frequencies at areas of the genome identified as being under selection correlate predictably with temperature or resource abundance, indicative of adaptive evolution. The fellow is being trained in molecular genetics and genomic methods, which will expand the fellow's understanding of evolutionary genomics and complement the fellow's background in evolutionary ecology and behavioral ecology.

Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This research project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which all other reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean Axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project will employ methods from non-Archimedean analysis and geometry in order to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics and geometry.

The connections between urban systems and their hinterlands is shaped by engineered, natural, and cyberinfrastructure systems along with social, political, and legal systems. This workshop will explore the connections between urban systems and the hinterlands to advance basic theory and applied knowledge of SUS-hinterland systems. The workshop will focus on the intermountain western U.S. with an emphasis on the host city of Albuquerque, New Mexico as a case study.the workshop will draw from broad transdisciplinary and cross-sector expertise to advance basic and applied questions and concepts on interconnected SUS-hinterland systems. <br/><br/>The workshop aims to bridge the gap between resilience theory and practice to advance knowledge and ultimately improve community resilience. To do so, the workshop will integrate local/applied systems expertise with international experts on resilience principles and practice. The host institution, the University of New Mexico, is a Hispanic Serving Institution and the workshop will involve students in all aspects of the workshop with an emphasis on students from underrepresented backgrounds. The workshop organizers will draw upon strong collaborations with the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute and Central New Mexico Community College to broaden engagement in the workshop. Further, the organizers will host students and faculty from Universidad de Sonora and Instituto Tecnologico de Hermosillo (Mexico) for the workshop and follow-on activities. The results will be disseminated through a white- paper, conference presentations, and via the NSF-supported research collaborative network on headwater systems throughout the Americas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UTEP is partnering with the El Paso Independent School District (EPISD), a high-need district with a majority of its population classified as Hispanic and at-risk. The partnership will establish an innovative and transformative teacher preparation program, integrating Noyce Scholars into school sites currently implementing project-based learning (PBL) with support from the New Tech Network (NTN), a national, non-profit network for comprehensive pedagogical and cultural change in public school settings. Specifically, the partnership will establish professional development school sites where pre-service STEM teachers learn theory and practice alongside university- and school-based faculty to innovatively prepare and graduate knowledgeable STEM teachers, who understand how learning theories inform meaningful and valuable instructional practices.<br/><br/>The Noyce@UTEP program goals are to: (1) recruit, certify, and retain Noyce Scholars, who are science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) undergraduate majors; (2) design and refine coursework and field-based teaching experiences to prepare Noyce Scholars to be effective teachers; and (3) create and disseminate knowledge on how best to prepare STEM teachers. Thirty-six (36) Noyce Scholars are expected to graduate with a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and secondary STEM teaching certification and be fully prepared to teach in high-need school districts. Science and Education faculty will co-design a senior-level required course for STEM majors with a secondary education minor, which will expose students to (1) novel methods for teaching students STEM concepts using PBL; (2) sheltered English instruction; and (3) special education in immersion programs. Other required education courses will integrate field experiences at school sites where PBL is implemented. Two of these courses will be held on an NTN high school campus where Noyce Scholars will meaningfully interact with in-service teachers and university faculty while being immersed in authentic PBL teaching and learning experiences. This will contribute to the formation of a community of practice, an integral component of the program. A research investigation will generate knowledge to understand the effect of social networks and support structures in preparing Noyce Scholars to teach in high-need schools with a predominantly Hispanic student population. Knowledge of best practices in preparing effective STEM teachers will be disseminated across various venues to include school administrator meetings and annual conferences, such as the New Tech Network Conference; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; National Science Teachers Association; American Educational Research Association; Conference for the Advancement of Science Teaching (CAST), sponsored by the Science Teachers Association of Texas; Conference for the Advancement of Mathematics Teaching; and TODOS (Mathematics for All: Excellence and Equity in Mathematics). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced and exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, some proteins contain nickel centers that react with carbon dioxide, which has very strong bonds. Catalysts based on nickel are widely used in energy-related chemistry. The research project led by Professor Joseph P. Sadighi at the Georgia Institute of Technology builds on these themes of strong bonds and energy-relevance. The project focuses on pairs of nickel atoms. The nickel atoms are linked in pairs using bridging atoms or bridging groups. The linkers that are explored in this work include hydrogen, nonmetallic elements, or another metal. The project examines bridging centers that are weakly bonded to each nickel center. These unusually weak bonds should make the complexes sufficiently stable to be isolated, yet unstable enough to be highly reactive. A deeper understanding of these compounds is providing insights into the design of catalysts for breaking strong bonds. The graduate and undergraduate researchers who carry out this research are introduced to concepts of bonding and reactivity, and to an array of synthetic and spectroscopic techniques. The group also participates in a Georgia Tech program to recruit high school students from demographics underrepresented in science.  The students are introduced to research through a summer and then through the academic year. This training prepares students to contribute to the future of science in the United States as teachers, or as researchers in academic, industrial, or government laboratories. The PI has extensive contacts with currently serving or recently transitioned veterans, and provides advice and encouragement to those returning to full-time study.<br/><br/>Nickel has been the subject of remarkable recent advances in metal-element bonding, and in bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions that enable catalysis. This research presents architectures derived from the interaction of two nickel(0) centers with a Lewis acid to form a bridging ligand. When the Lewis acid is a proton, this interaction creates a rare linear hydride bridge; The [Ni---H---Ni]+ core is held together by a three-center, four-electron bond, analogous to that in the bifluoride ion. One aim is the synthesis of a series of related hydride-bridged dinickel complexes, enabling an assessment of the hydridic character of the bridging hydrogen, and a detailed study of the complex's reactivity toward the C-CN bonds of nitriles. Another aim explores the formation of bridges derived from Lewis-acidic main group species such as carbocations, boranes, alanes, or organometallic fragments. Finally, the insertion of copper(I) or gold(I) cations between the nickel centers would afford heterometallic systems with a single net bond across three metal centers. The hypothesis underpinning these aims is that the [Ni---E---Ni] ensembles are sufficiently stable for isolation or characterization, yet display reactivity distinct from that of mononickel complexes [Ni-E], nickel alone, or the bridging element alone. Students who work on this project learn concepts of bonding and chemical synthesis. They acquire technical skills in the preparation of air-sensitive complexes.  They are trained in analysis using modern instrumentation. These researchers include graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. The program identifies underrepresented minority students interested in scientific research.  This training prepares students for technical careers in education, research, and industry. In another form of outreach, Professor Sadighi advises fellow veterans on their return to full-time study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project attacks this question using a combination of mathematical modeling and high-resolution, closed loop experiments using the prey attack and predator evasion behaviors of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a model for studying how animals generate flexible, robust behavioral sequences. In particular, the investigators will test the emerging hypothesis that these robust, higher-level behavioral responses are achieved through a mechanism called behavioral gain control. Research will explore how behavioral gain control is involved in initiating behavioral sequences at the right time, balancing multiple competing objectives, coordinating control along multiple behavioral dimensions (e.g., acceleration, turning), and maintaining performance across changing environmental conditions.

Recently, a research team from the particle astrophysics community teamed with lightning researchers to obtain new observations of gamma rays using the Telescope Array Surface Detector (TASD) in Utah, which is a 700 square kilometer cosmic ray observatory.  This award will continue these investigations into the generation of TGFs.  The main societal impact from this award will be through the increased understanding of TGFs, which may provide additional information on lightning, a well-known natural hazard.

Now that this phenomenon has been discovered, the research team plans to address specific questions about the mechanisms responsible for gamma ray production and characterization of the types of lightning events in which TGFs occur.  New observations will be conducted with the addition of a high-speed broadband VHF interferometer and fast electric field change sensor.

Research will explore how behavioral gain control is involved in initiating behavioral sequences at the right time, balancing multiple competing objectives, coordinating control along multiple behavioral dimensions (e.g., acceleration, turning), and maintaining performance across changing environmental conditions. This work has the potential to shed new light on how complex behaviors are generated in the context of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This project aims at further understanding how adult behavior is shaped through events that occur during brain development. These studies will include new and interesting techniques that will manipulate early brain activity in mice. These NSF funds are also being used to improve networking among underrepresented students through development of an open access website which archives the achievements and research interests of scientists from underrepresented groups. As a Native American herself, the fellow will visit several tribal colleges to attract Native American students into biology. Work throughout the project will engage underrepresented students in numerous aspects of biology and science in general.<br/><br/>New bioluminescent optogenetics technology will be used to unravel the dynamic interactions of subtypes of neurons underlying the wiring blueprint assembled during distinct time windows in the developing brain. Bioluminescent optogenetics utilizes light emitted from a luciferase, triggered in the presence of a small molecule substrate, to activate a tethered light-sensing ion channel, for rapid non-invasive manipulation of cell excitability. Using this tool, the project will test the hypothesis that altering neural activity during early postnatal development in genetically determined populations in the immature cortex modifies synaptogenesis and circuit assembly, and consequently affects circuit connectivity and behavior in the adult organism. Specifically, the Fellow will utilize electrophysiological recordings in brain slices and in live animals to: 1) characterize the functional changes resulting from induced developmental hyperactivity throughout development and in the adult, 2) define the role of layer-specific subtypes of pyramidal neurons in establishing neural circuit trajectories, and 3) determine whether modulation of pyramidal activity during distinct periods of postnatal development will have differential impacts. The project includes wide-ranging training activities for the Fellow, encompassing comprehensive training in scientific skills and concepts, research communication, and development of professional skills. Furthermore, the Fellow is taking on mentoring, teaching and outreach activities towards students from underrepresented groups, particularly Native Americans, in order to promote their recruitment and participation in biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite being widely used in applications, many fundamental issues in the rigorous mathematical analysis of these interactions remain challenging. The presence of boundaries, especially free boundaries, makes the underlying partial differential equations modeling the phenomena highly nonlinear and nonlocal. This project will further the mathematical understanding of equations in which fluids interact with either rigid boundaries, free boundaries, or both. The problems studied in this project are motivated by physics (drop formation and fluid jets), economics (optimal transport), and engineering (reservoir engineering). The analytical understanding gained in this work will increase our understanding of the basic physical phenomena and mathematical models used in practice.

To this end, large-scale simulations will be applied to study how the ribosome can accurately and efficiently synthesize proteins. The production of proteins is essential for nearly all biological functions, making the ribosome one of the most important biological machines. While modern experiments can resolve static configurations of the ribosome, detailed simulations will allow the research community to understand how molecular structure enables specific biological function. This can reveal strategies for controlling cellular dynamics, as well as provide a ""rule book"" that can aid in the design of novel molecular-scale machines. This project will involve a range of activities that will provide introductory science seminars for high school students, valuable training experiences for undergraduate and graduate student researcher and workshops for experimental researchers.<br/><br/>Theoretical models will be developed and applied to identify the detailed role of localized, ""diffuse"" ions during ribosome function. Characterizing several critical substeps of the elongation cycle (tRNA accommodation, hybrid-state formation, translocation and domain rotations) will elucidate how the ionic environment shapes the energy landscape of the ribosome. This will help uncover the modes by which ions can enable conformationally-complex biological dynamics. With the high negative charge density of RNA, the dynamics of ribonucleoprotein assemblies rely critically on a locally diffuse ionic environment, which can lead to attraction between negatively charged RNA molecules. Accordingly, to fully characterize the energetics of large-scale biological assemblies, one must properly describe the statistical properties of the ionic environment. To address this challenge, simplified energetic models will be developed that employ all-atom resolution, as well as explicitly represented monovalent and divalent ions. Calibration of the energetic parameters will be established through comparison with experiments and explicit-solvent simulations of prototypical systems. These simplified models will then enable the simulation of large-scale (20-100 Angstroms) conformational transitions in the ribosome. This will implicate the influence of fluctuations/changes in local ionic distributions.

The discovery of the mechanisms of quark confinement and hadron mass generation  are central goals of fundamental research in particle and nuclear physics. Experimentally, small droplets of QGP, at record temperatures exceeding 2 trillion Kelvin, can be re-created in the laboratory by colliding atomic nuclei at high energies, at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider.

They are also bellwethers for change in the landscape. However, a question of fundamental importance for national interest is how river systems respond to major environmental changes. Predicting how changes in environmental conditions affect river processes, such as flooding and erosion, is critical for water resource management. This project uses knowledge of the past as a key to better inform the present through examining ~35 million year old sediments from an ancient river network in western Nebraska and South Dakota to quantify how changes in precipitation, vegetation and temperature in the past caused changes in river discharge and flood magnitude. These data, integrated with hydraulic models, will improve our ability to predict how rivers flood, sediment is transported and catchments evolve. Results of this work will have far reaching implications for understanding, modeling and planning for changes to river systems in the future. Three key broader impacts of this study include: 1) support of graduate and undergraduate students to develop interdisciplinary expertise; 2) sharing of data, methods and results as teaching data-sets on open-access platforms; 3) science outreach modules for children to explore 3-dimensional rock outcrops and animations from computational models. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to reconstruct the coevolution of paleoriver and ecosystems dynamics with environmental change in western North America during the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), perhaps the largest climate state change of the last 65 million years. This will be accomplished by integrating geochemical records of paleoclimate, sedimentologic indicators of river transport and deposition, and hydraulic-geomorphic models. To achieve the project goals a team of geochemists, sedimentologists and hydraulic engineers will develop an integrated approach to understanding how rivers respond to environmental change. Success in this cross-disciplinary approach could provide a paradigm shift in utilizing modern and ancient terrestrial geologic archives to quantify environmental perturbations that manifest in the hydraulics, morphodynamics and regional ecosystem responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A flexible and easy-to-manufacture pressure sensor could function as an artificial skin for people and objects and could lead to cheap and convenient solutions for wearable computer interfaces, touch enabled spaces, and biomedical movement diagnostics.  Such a device with a wireless interface will allow for ease-of-use in sensor interfaces. With the help of an unconventional sensor mapping method called resistive tomography, it is possible to create such a platform using only a single piece of easy-to-manufacture pressure-sensitive material to map pressures.  Device fabrication for such a flexible sensor is trivial in comparison to standard sensor arrays, with the complexity shifted to the signal processing needed to interpret the pressure pattern.  Multiple measurements using various combinations of contacts can create the full pressure map.  It is expected that the technology that is developed from this effort will lead to new kinds of flexible sensors for wearable touch-pad like interfaces and biomedical movement diagnostics.<br/><br/>Most of today's two dimensional (2D) touch sensors and strain sensors require an indexed array of individual sensors in order to gather spatial information, requiring significant complexity in the fabrication stage, while impairing durability and broader applicability.  This work proposes a new means of gathering 2D spatial data combining touch sensing and strain mapping that uses a trivial fabricated composite membrane to serve as the spatial pressure sensor, with the complexity shifted from fabrication to the computational domain through a tomographic mapping algorithm.  This research will develop new tomographic algorithms based on a Zernike moment analysis to convert resistive four-point measurements at the periphery of a strain-sensitive membrane into a 2D map of the local pressures applied throughout the area of the membrane.  The membrane will be made of a nanotube-silicone conducting composite rubber developed for this purpose.  An energy-efficient measurement architecture and wireless interface to the membrane will allow this strain-sensor map to be easily employed in-the-field for various mechanical, medical, engineering, and personal-user applications.  The low cost of fabrication will lend itself to ubiquitous touch sensors and novel modes of interaction for wearable and Internet-of-Everything applications. The trivial fabrication method of the sensor component and the conformability of the sensor around any shape make for a mass-producible, easily implemented, and highly versatile strain sensor and flexible touchpad. The exact algorithms to be investigated here can be applied on a much broader class of systems, expanding the utility of tomographic methods in sensing. The conducting elastomer sensor material will be developed to optimize the tomography application envisioned here. The ideas generated in the course of this proposal are expected to generate new intellectual property in the area of sensors, such as flexible, wearable touchpads for computer interfaces, likely to spawn new industry products. The conformal ability to shape such a sensor will lead to broader applications in the health industry for rehabilitation, such as a tomographic sock to sense bending and mechanical strain at the elbow, knee, or torso for health monitoring.  Durable, long-lasting, zero-maintenance haptic skin for prosthetic limbs and robotics can be produced at extremely low cost with the technology proposed here.

Engineered cyanobacteria can produce a variety of compounds, but the productivities are too low to be commercially appealing. Also, current large-scale photosynthetic production schemes rely on natural sunlight for energy, thereby limiting production to daylight hours. The proposed production system is designed to overcome these limitations. It has been shown previously that improvement of RuBisCO, the CO2 fixation enzyme, is very challenging. Thus, this project will develop an alternative strategy to improve carbon fixation by increasing intracellular levels of the substrate for RuBisCO and directing carbon flux towards chemical production. The strategies developed will also serve as tools for probing and understanding phototrophic behavior and metabolism.

Achieving both single molecule detection and structural information in a single experiment is a long-sought-after, but very challenging goal.   Professor Tokmakoff's strategy involves the use of both the fluorescence and vibrational properties of molecules.  In fluorescence, a molecule exposed to visible or ultraviolet light re-emits light of a specific wavelength range (color).  This emission can be very strong, even enough for a single molecule to be detected.  However, the emitted light does not tell us very much about the structure of the molecule.    On the other hand, molecules vibrate with frequencies that correspond to infrared light (""IR""), what we feel as heat, and also exploit in night vision goggles.  Observing how molecules absorb IR light can tell us a lot about their structure, but one needs a high concentration of molecules to obtain sufficient signal.   Tokmakoff uses laser pulses of visible and infrared light, carefully sequenced in such a way the intense fluorescence emission contains the information normally provided in an IR experiment, hence the name Fluorescence-Encoded Infrared (FEIR) spectroscopy.  The research is focusing the FEIR technique on simple reactions like acid-dissociation, where a molecule loses a proton (positively charged hydrogen atom), and bimolecular complex formation, where two molecules stick to each other and undergo subtle structural changes.  FEIR represents an entirely new approach to understanding chemical reactions, and has far -reaching implications not only in chemistry, but materials science and biophysics.  The graduate students engaged in this project are experiencing a cross-disciplinary setting that includes design and construction of advanced instrumentation, training in optics and spectroscopy, methods in molecular biology, and molecular modeling and computer simulation. For broad distribution of course materials, Professor Tokmakoff has also made online instructional resources accessible by others in the field. <br/><br/>The method used in this project, fluorescence-encoded infrared (FEIR) spectroscopy, combines structural  specificity and SM sensitivity by encoding the absorption of IR light onto a visible fluorescence signal. The Tokmakoff group has demonstrated the principles and capabilities of FEIR, using ensemble measurements of ultrafast Fourier-transform and multidimensional spectroscopy, and developed the experimental capability for measuring FEIR spectra and femtosecond transients at 10-100 nanomolar concentrations, approaching the sensitivity regime of individual molecules. The objective of this project is to develop the capabilities for performing an FEIR analog of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments, in which the vibrational spectrum is used to track the time-evolving state of molecules for studies of chemical kinetics and dynamics. The Tokmakoff group will apply this technique to the kinetics of proton transfer and bimolecular association/dissociation equilibria, and study how FEIR spectra sense the environment of the fluorescent probe.

A donut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences, and can be used to model many interesting phenomena. The main goal of this project is to study the mathematical properties of three-manifolds. The PI plans to investigate some central questions in a branch of mathematics, known as low dimensional topology. These questions are concerned with how three-manifolds change under certain maps as well as operations called surgeries. The major tool that the PI uses is a topological structure called Heegaard splitting, which is a decomposition of a complicated three-manifold into simpler pieces along a two-dimensional surface. This research targets some of the fundamental questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory. It also has a potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.<br/> <br/>In this project, the PI will study the topology of three-manifolds. The project has three major parts. The first part is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. The Berge Conjecture can be divided into two halves: the first half is to prove the Berge Conjecture for knots with tunnel number one, and the second half is to show that if a nontrivial knot in the three-sphere admits a lens-space Dehn surgery, then the knot must have tunnel number one. The PI and his collaborators have carried out an in-depth study on the first half. The same approach may lead to a proof of the second half of the Berge Conjecture. The second part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The PI will investigate this conjecture using special type of surgeries. The objective of the last part of the research is to study several fundamental questions in three-manifold topology concerning Heegaard splittings and curve complex. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Being connected with challenging mathematical problems, this research area has proved to be very useful for applications in other fields such as statistics, information theory, computer science, machine learning. One of the objectives of the project is to clarify the role of growing dimension as a unifying source in high-dimensional models and, in particular, its influence on the entire evolution in time as opposed to local rules.

Engel of the University of Chicago is developing novel laser spectroscopies to measure how molecules react with different handedness of light. Some molecules, much like our hands, are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. These molecules are called chiral molecules and they interact with light differently depending on the twist of polarization (direction) of the light field. This project is expanding chemists' understanding of handedness, from static structure to dynamic motions. It is looking at how rates of reaction differ due to corkscrew-like motions of electrons during chemical transformations. The timescales of the motions involved are femtoseconds (millionths of a billionth of a second). The signals containing the chiral information are many times weaker than typical signals measured with traditional spectroscopy. This project is creating instrumentation to measure these signals with the necessary sensitivity. By extending chemists' understanding of chirality (handedness), this project is enabling novel control of chemical reactions, testing existing theories for the electronic structure of molecules, and opening new avenues for engineering quantum materials.  The graduate and undergraduate students in the Engel laboratory are engaged not only in the science of chiral molecular systems, but in the development of chiral 2D spectroscopy.  Their education and training experience is therefore quite unique.  In addition, the Engel team has an active outreach collaboration with the Chicago-based Girls4Science program and with the Museum of Science and Industry. <br/><br/>Combining ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy and circular dichroism has long been a dream of spectroscopists. But signal strengths orders of magnitude weaker than the achiral background frustrate attempts to create a complete map correlating chiral response and dynamics. The project exploits GRadient Assisted Photon Echo Spectroscopy (GRAPES) developed and patented in the Engel Group to realize chiral 2D spectroscopy. Using GRAPES with the polarization sequences LXXX and RXXX, the Engel Group is investigating how the cross peak dynamics in the two dimensional spectra depend critically on the handedness of light. Chiral rate constants can be observed, but this dynamics only appears when sufficient bandwidth in pulse 1 is present to excite the adjacent chromophores.  That is, a chiral interaction (likely magnetic) with the delocalized excited state of adjacent molecules is causing these chiral dynamics. More generally, this spectroscopy directly monitors collapse of delocalized electronics states, differential chiral dynamics, changes in absolute configuration, strength of coupling to asymmetric environments, and differential system-bath coupling amongst enantiomers. The broader impacts of this work include instrument designs that make these experiments more reliable and more accessible to other laboratories and to industry. The project is creating tools that validate time-dependent electronic structure theories, observe intervalley dynamics in 2D materials, establish new paradigms for light-matter interactions involving B-fields, demonstrate chiral reaction dynamics, and probe design principles of photosynthetic light harvesting. In addition to their immersion into the science and instrumentation of chiral 2D spectroscopy, students in the Engel group are being mentored in the ?business of science,"" from the practical maintenance of laboratory infrastructure, to identifying and securing sources of research funding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the deformations can sometimes be visible to the naked eye, the actual deformation processes take place at very small length scales, which necessitates the use of electron microscopes operated at high magnification. This research will develop a new experimental technique to measure these deformations with high accuracy. Such detailed measurements will contribute to our understanding of how materials deform, and, ultimately, this will impact how metals and alloys can be used safely in structural applications throughout society. All techniques developed in this program will be made available to the community through publications and in the form of open source code.  The PI will also explore the possibility of generating free college-level text books via a crowd-sourcing approach; this ""OpenChapters"" project will combine individual chapters written by multiple authors into customizable on-demand text books that will be freely available to college students as well as to society at large.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Modern engineering materials often have a complex multi-phase microstructure that makes it difficult to accurately predict how they will behave under the influence of an applied stress.  Many aspects of the deformation behavior of a material are still poorly understood. The extraction of lattice strains from deformed polycrystalline samples is a difficult undertaking that requires renewed attention due to the availability of new detector systems, in particular for electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD), the tool of choice for the proposed program. The PI and his group will employ a physics-based model for the prediction of EBSD patterns and incorporate a new capability to include the deformation tensor in the pattern generation algorithm.  In combination with a recently developed indexing algorithm, a new approach will be developed to determine the deformation tensor components by matching complete simulated EBSD patterns against their experimental versions, with an anticipated strain resolution of better than 0.0001 over large sample areas. This program has the potential to advance our understanding of micro- and nano-scale mechanisms of deformation in modern engineering materials as well as in lower symmetry geological samples. The combination of sensitive EBSD detectors with a modified indexing scheme will lay the foundation for the routine determination of strain fields by full-pattern matching of EBSD data. The algorithms will be made available to the community in peer-reviewed publications and as open source code. On the educational side, the OpenChapters project will address the rapidly rising cost of text books by creating an open source mechanism for the generation of free text books by a crowd-sourcing approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the bending stiffness of the device is primarily affected by the modulus and thickness of each device layer, successful demonstrations include the use of low-modulus substrate or exploration of thin device structures.  However, the materials are limited in the former, and low-cost fabrication is challenging in the latter.  Additionally, non-water-soluble properties of both classes create electronic waste streams, posing environmental concerns.  An innovative, fully water-soluble bioelectronic device is proposed in which zinc sensors are fabricated on the galactomannan substrate through a low-cost fabrication process.

This infalling matter is heated to high temperatures, causing it to radiate.  Black hole accretion is a very complicated process: different black holes can have very different brightness, or luminosity, and the luminosity of an individual black hole usually varies considerably with time.  A research group at the College of Charleston will study black hole accretion using numerical computer simulations.  They will study three different accretion regimes, in distinctly different luminosity ranges, using cutting-edge simulations, and working with collaborators to compare their results directly with observations of the corresponding luminosity states. The goal is to solve some long-standing puzzles and attach physical explanations to observational phenomena.  The expectation is that at least six undergraduate students will be involved in the project, gaining an exceptional opportunity to be exposed to forefront research in computational astrophysics. Additionally, the principal investigator will continue to disseminate his research results in a number of diverse forums, including engagements with the local arts community, presentations in local schools, YouTube videos, educational iPad apps, and Astronomy on Tap presentations.<br/><br/>Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in understanding black hole accretion through numerical simulations. The addition of radiative cooling and radiation transport to such simulations over the past decade has made it possible to begin to make tighter connections and comparisons with observations.

Beginning at moderate luminosities, they will leverage the recent addition of multi-group radiation transport to their general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code to directly model the intermediate spectral states of X-ray binaries, including both the soft and hard photon contributions.  At slightly higher luminosities, 10-20% of the Eddington limit, they plan to tackle the long-standing puzzle as to why disks in this range appear so stable in nature.  Working from the hypothesis that strong magnetic fields may stabilize such disks, they plan to test multiple magnetic field configurations with the expectation that some may lead to high magnetization and stability.  Lastly, they will extend their simulations beyond the Eddington limit to consider ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Li studies the characteristic properties of molecules, solids and materials in the presence of magnetic fields.  When atoms bond to form molecules and solids their electrons rearrange and, because the moving electrons are charged particles, their motion generates magnetic fields.  Consequently, such molecular systems possess both electrical (due to the electron's charge) and magnetic properties.  These systems are studied using experiments that observe changes when light is directed on the molecule in the presence of a magnetic field.  The results of this experiment are complicated due to many contributing factors.  A specific goal of Dr. Li's research is to use computational methods known as real-time time-dependent density functional theory to help to interpret the experimental results. Understanding these experiments can advance new technologies relevant to sustainable energy, catalysis, quantum computing, and other applications that benefit society. New computational advances are distributed to the community.  These new tools  also provide advanced interdisciplinary education and training in the areas of inorganic, theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry.

The goal of these studies is to provide a basic understanding of the processes that underlie the use of molecular sieves as filters to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In some of these materials, cations (atoms that have lost electrons) act as selective trapdoors, allowing some, but not all, gases to diffuse through. Computer simulations allow gaining microscopic insight into this interesting behavior. These studies offer a singular opportunity to gain fundamental understanding that can assess and guide the design and identification of materials useful in a variety of industrial processes. At Carleton College, a predominantly undergraduate institution, Professor Kohen actively engages undergraduate students in chemistry research.  The students involved in this research study chemistry through the lens of molecular simulations, which provides them with a powerful tool to give new meaning to familiar concepts, as well as training that allows them to become proficient with complicated computations, an important benefit given the ever-increasing needs of our technological society.<br/><br/>Zeolites are an attractive option for carbon dioxide capture in many industrial processes due to their variety and stability. However, some of their fundamental behaviors are not understood, which limits the ability to rationally design new materials or to improve existing ones.  The shortage of experimental techniques that allow for the direct observation of cation motion, combined with the deficiency of appropriate computational models, has significantly limited understanding of cation motion at an atom by atom level.  This understanding is not only of fundamental interest, but these motions can also be intimately related to behaviors that give zeolites useful properties in many practical applications. This project is an in-depth computational study of the motions of cations within zeolites. It aims to gain detailed microscopic understanding by a careful combination of well-established molecular dynamics simulation tools (where all atoms are treated as interacting objects) with recently developed ab initio molecular dynamics techniques (were atoms as treated as protons and electrons interacting with each other). Recent developments in computational techniques enable a systematic study of the dynamics of the cations and how they relate to zeolite geometry and chemical environment. This project characterizes and then compares cation dynamics within different zeolite families. These families are chosen to capitalize on existing experimental data and aim to contribute to fundamental understanding needed to develop critical applications. In addition to the research itself and its potential applications of our findings, a key component in the proposed activities is the training of undergraduates as active researchers that focus on fundamental understanding of behavior within thought-provoking and promising materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The question of identifying the processes occurring beneath volcanoes is of crucial significance, as such knowledge is necessary to better predict destructive eruptions. An important aspect of petrology and geochemistry is to develop new tools that allow researchers to assess how volcanic magma chambers work and evolve. Unfortunately, applications of these tools give contrasting answers that lead to contradictory models in the literature for the storage and eruption capacity of volcanic reservoirs. This project seeks to reconcile the community by providing a common ground where proponents of different models and tools can meet and learn, Only an open-minded, reconciled approach would allow the identification of trends among different volcanoes and improve our understanding of volcanic systems that pose a threat to human life and infrastructure. This project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, and supports a graduate student.<br/><br/>In the past couple of years, two models have emerged for the evolution of silicic magma systems: Cold Storage, based on geospeedometry applications, and Warm Storage, mostly based on thermal models and zircon geochronology/geochemistry studies. Both models have critical implications on the mechanisms of volcanic eruptions, and are highly debated within the petrology community. A lot of efforts are currently allotted in the literature to discuss the merits of the various tools used in both cold and warm storage models; however, none of those tools have been applied together on the same volcanic systems. Therefore, it is unclear if the different storage conditions documented so far in the literature are linked to the analytical methods used, or reflect a more fundamental problem, that physical mechanisms in volcanic systems are too variable for the establishment of a unified model. In this project, we propose to apply analytical methods used in the past to bolster the arguments for both cold and warm storage together on the same volcanic systems and address the most fundamental question, do all volcanoes of similar size and tectonic context work the similarly. We propose to apply Sr diffusion in plagioclase (cold storage tool) together with zircon geochronology/geochemistry (warm storage tool) on three different arc volcanoes that were previously used to bolster either the cold or warm storage argument, the St. Lucia Soufriere Volcanic Center, Mt. Hood (Cascade Mountain Range) and the Okataina Caldera (Taupo Volcanic Arc, New Zealand). Our work will concentrate on both lavas and cogenetic plutonic enclaves from the three case studies. By combining results from all set of tools, samples and eruptive events, we will draw a more comprehensive thermal history for these three volcanoes, identify common features in volcanic reservoirs of similar size and setting and test the cold and warm storage tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This rate of improvement is described by Moore's Law, and has started to falter for a variety of reasons. One new paradigm that may permit continued rapid growth is quantum computing. Quantum computing exploits the laws of quantum mechanics and may solve certain problems that are essentially intractable with conventional computers. The key fundamental unit in a quantum computer is the so called quantum bit (or qubit), in analogy to the classical binary bit. This research aims to understand electron spins in low-dimensional materials and develop a new type of qubit based on these electron spins. A close collaboration between the two universities in this project helps promote partnership between the institutions. This research activity provides interdisciplinary training for the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved in this project in the areas of material science, quantum optics, and nanophotonics. It also serves as an exciting opportunity for the training of our next-generation workforce in quantum information science.  <br/><br/>The spin of a single electron is a natural candidate for qubits due to its capability to store and process quantum information. A key challenge in operating an electron spin as a functional qubit is to turn on and off its coupling to the external environment with full control. By establishing a spin-photon interface in the qubit materials, it is possible to efficiently manipulate and readout the spin states using optical techniques. This approach has been successfully implemented in studying several types of naturally occurring defect qubits in bulk materials. To move beyond spin qubits in bulk materials and allow design and control of the qubit systems on the atomic scale, the research team adopts a bottom-up approach to develop molecular spin qubits integrated in low dimensional materials. The full synthetic control of the molecular qubits enables effective tuning of their electronic structures. Molecular design and composition control also allow addressing physical processes that drive spin decoherence. Combining first-principle theory calculations and experimental studies, this research aims to develop a new type of molecular spin qubits that interface optical photons. The material platform established in this research advances understanding of chemistry-enabled qubits and their application in quantum devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chen of the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University is developing new synthetic routes for the construction of industrially-important stereoregular polymeric materials.  Stereochemistry is an essential aspect of chemistry that generally focuses on compounds in which carbon atoms are attached to four different groups.  The specific arrangement of the groups on a carbon gives rise to mirror images that cannot be superimposed; These mirror images are called chiral molecules and they occur in pairs.  [Notably, human hands are also chiral because the left hand is a mirror image of the right hand, but one cannot turn or move one of the hands to look exactly the same as the other.] Chirality is property that dictates biological, thermal and mechanical properties of compounds or materials.  In the case of polymers, which are large molecules made by linking a large number of carbons together, the number of chiral possibilities can be very large.  For example, in a relatively small polymer consisting of only 30 carbon atoms, the maximum number of unique chiral configurations is estimated at a billion.  This research develops sophisticated methodologies that control and fine tune the number of chiral outcomes during the preparation of polymers, yielding a completely new and previously unexplored class of plastic materials.  The activities associated with this award increase broadening participation and enable training of undergraduate and graduate students in the industrially-important field of polymer chemistry.<br/><br/>In this work, a next generation Lewis pair polymerization (LLP) system is developed that can control the stereochemical outcomes and topologies of the resulting polymers, thereby enabling facile access to advanced polymeric materials with different tacticities or stereomicrostructures and cyclic topological structures.  LLP methodology relies on an interacting or frustrated Lewis pair (LP) and exploits the synergy and cooperativity between the Lewis acidic and basic sites of LPs to effect cooperative monomer activation as well as chain initiation, propagation, termination and transfer events.  The research includes synthetic, catalytic and mechanistic approaches, coupled with synergistic theoretical and computational methods.  Investigated monomers include industrially-important polar vinyl monomers and crotonic esters.  The latter monomers provide access to unique ditactic polymers which are currently unobtainable by other synthetic methods.  Additionally, topological and stereochemical control in the LPP of acrylic monomers enables selective synthesis of cyclic acrylic polymers in chiral helical or achiral forms.  The research in this work is highly innovative and transformative with the potential to significantly impact not only the field of polymer chemistry, but also synthetic organic chemistry and catalysis in general.  Through carefully designed and planned activities, the research team provides tangible solutions to the control of tacticity, which has been traditionally one of the main weaknesses in modern synthetic polymer chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To advance these and other applications, it is important to be able to design and make materials in ways that allow precise control over the features that define their properties. In this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the PI and his group chemically manipulate nanoscale particles of metal sulfides and related compounds to produce new materials in a rational and controllable way. To do this, metal cations in the sulfide materials are replaced with other metal cations under mild reaction conditions to change the composition without significantly changing the arrangements of the atoms. New compounds can be produced when all of the metal cations in a particle are replaced, which provides an approach for rationally targeting a material that cannot be made by established methods. By replacing only a fraction of the metal cations, the particles that are formed contain both the original material and a new material, joined together through an interface. By performing this partial replacement reaction multiple times on the same particle, complex particles are produced that have many different materials and interfaces. The PI and his group are studying these complete and partial cation exchange reactions to better understand the factors that contribute to the formation of targeted products so that researchers can more efficiently design and make new materials that are predicted to be useful, but that cannot be made easily using current knowledge. The PI and his group use these reactions in undergraduate laboratories to introduce students to new ways of thinking about designing and making materials and also partner with faculty and students from local colleges through a regional undergraduate research network.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, provides new capabilities for the design and synthesis of metal chalcogenide nanoparticles using cation exchange reactions. In these reactions, cations in a colloidal metal chalcogenide nanoparticle are replaced by cations from solution while maintaining the anion framework. Crystal structure can therefore be preserved, and cation exchange reactions can be used to rationally target metastable phases (through complete cation exchange) and complex heterostructured nanoparticles (through sequential partial cation exchange). The PI and his group study cation exchange reactions of metal chalcogenide nanoparticles to understand how they proceed and can be controlled, to diversify the scope and complexity of accessible systems, and to access new materials with desired structures and properties. This is important for advancing the broad application space of metal chalcogenide nanomaterials. In this project, studies of model systems provide insights into how the crystal structure of a precursor nanoparticle can be retained in the product after complete cation exchange, revealing guidelines for rationally targeting metastable phases. Complementary studies of sequential partial cation exchange reactions uncover useful design rules for rationally synthesizing a library of heterostructured nanoparticles containing many interfaces and materials. Striped nanorod superlattices synthesized using these cation exchange reactions serve as a nanomodulated platform for studying low-temperature diffusion and crystallization. Integration of a nanocrystal cation exchange project into an undergraduate chemistry laboratory is introducing students to modern aspects of solid-state, nanomaterials, and inorganic reaction chemistry.

A crucial idea in this area, first developed in the 1970s by Shelah, is the notion of a dividing line. A dividing line can be thought of as a structural dichotomy within a certain class of mathematical objects.  Many of the most important dividing lines correspond to local combinatorial properties which have significant implications for global structure.  In the infinite setting, model theorists have had great success using dividing lines to classify examples and generalize their behavior. However, extensions into the finite setting have been limited, largely due to the failure there of crucial infinitary tools.  On the other hand, extremal and arithmetic combinatorics are fields which focus on the finite setting, but which study many of the same themes as model theory, such as local versus global structure and the interplay of structure and randomness.  These fields have developed finitary questions and tools which are new to model theory, but which have have deep connections to model theoretic ideas.  The goal of this project is to extend the study of model theoretic dividing lines in the finite setting by solving finitary problems from extremal and additive combinatorics which address these shared themes.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on finding local model theoretic conditions which have robust implications for bounds and growth rates in theorems from additive and extremal combinatorics.

For instance, what kinds of sets are most ""tame'', as measured through improved bounds in structural decomposition theorems?

The negatively charged excited electron and the positive charge left behind (hole) attract each other and form a bound pair known as an exciton. These excited pairs are capable of transporting energy in materials and play an important role in natural processes such as photosynthesis as well as organic devices such as photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. Understanding the transport of excitons adds a new dimensionality to not only bolster the performance of the current excitonic devices but also introduce a platform for next-generation optoexcitonic devices. The current work studies the energy transport and its relation to the separation between the bound electron and hole pair that form the exciton. Above and beyond addressing fundamental and technological challenges, this research at the frontiers of optoelectronic and quantum materials provides an ideal venue for truly interdisciplinary education at all levels. In addition to PhD training, the results of the research findings are being incorporated into the curriculum of graduate and undergraduate courses as well as used for training of undergraduate students. The knowledge gained from this research has a potential to push forward the frontiers of research, innovations and educating the next generation of scientists and engineers for a better future. <br/><br/>Technical description: Exciton transport in two-dimensional semiconductors has recently received significant attention due to the prospects of achieving room-temperature-stable excitonic devices. These van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors support stable room temperature excitons due to reduced dielectric screening that results in high binding energies and small Bohr radii. However, since these excitons remain delocalized over a few lattice spacings, qualitative as well as quantitative understanding of the transport behavior has been difficult. This is reflected from the fact that classifying the excitons as Wannier-Mott or Frenkel excitons is not trivial in these materials. Understanding the transport is crucial for the development of the material system as a device platform as it determines the architecture of the devices. To meet this challenge, the research team undertake a joint experimental and computational research effort using diffusion imaging microscope, ultrafast pump-probe and nonlinear optical techniques, photoluminescence spectroscopy and first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to conduct a systematic study of excitonic energy transport properties that can provide insight on the excitonic states. The team investigates excitonic energy transport in varying Lead Iodide layers that are sandwiched between hexagonal Boron Nitride. This material system enables two independent knobs (i) thickness of Lead Iodide (ii) thickness of Boron Nitride, to control the dielectric screening of the excitons and hence the amount of delocalization. Such atomic level control over the excitonic states as well as dielectric screening provides an opportunity to study the relationship between localized and delocalized excitonic energy transport in the same material system. In doing so, it could potentially enable control over band-like or hopping-like energy-transport mechanisms. Control over transport behavior is potentially transformative as it will change the rules on how charge and/or excited states are exploited for various devices such as photovoltaics, light generation, transistors, etc. Through this work, the research team attempts to gain control over the energy flow between and within nanoscale system that will enhance progress in quantum-information science, energy harvesting, metrology, and light sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference will bring together researchers in the mathematical and biological sciences to share their latest research findings on the use of mathematical modeling and analysis to study problems arising in population biology and the life sciences, with emphasis on the fast-growing and challenging area of models in molecular and synthetic biology. The participants will range from internationally recognized established researchers to early career researchers and students (postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate). The conference will include five plenary lectures given by selected researchers and approximately eighty invited or contributed talks by others, including early career participants. This conference will provide an opportunity for participants to establish new connections and energize established collaborations. Twenty students and early-career participants will be with an emphasis on women and members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The broad theme of the conference is the formulation, validation, analysis and simulation of mathematical models for gaining insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological populations. Specific topics include: fundamentals of molecular biology, mathematical immunology, genetic-epidemiology models, stoichiometric population models, mathematical oncology, mathematics of gene editing, and dynamics of multi-host-vector-pathogen systems. Mathematical modelling and analysis, coupled with novel mathematical and statistical techniques in data analytics, play a central role in providing realistic insight into the dynamics of real-life phenomena arising in the life sciences in general and molecular and synthetic biology in particular.  In addition to allowing for the design and implementation of effective strategies for ensuring the persistence or extinction of some species (such as using gene editing to control the population abundance of malaria mosquitoes), molecular approaches potentially promote the development of new therapies for effectively combatting many human ailments, creating a need for population models which account for molecular techniques. For this effort to be effective, modelers and biologists need to build new collaborations, and a goal of the conference is to promote such interdisciplinary connections. The meeting will include participants whose research involves model derivation, mathematical and computational analysis of models and interfacing models with data and observations. The plenary speakers will be encouraged to reach a broad audience, surveying the current state of research in their field of study and suggesting new directions.

This central subject in mathematics has seen contributions made by many well-known mathematicians including Fermat, Euler, and Gauss. Modern study of Diophantine equations in the early 20th century started with the theory of quadratic forms by Hilbert, followed by the remarkable discovery of the local-to-global principle of Hasse and Minkowski. Weil carried the idea of Hasse-Minkowski further,  incorporating the idea of Riemann zeta function, to define what is now called Hasse-Weil zeta function, which is built up on the numbers of solutions of polynomial equations in the much simpler setting of modular arithmetic.  Can one recover to a certain extent the integral or rational solutions from the Hasse-Weil zeta function (and hence from the solutions in modular arithmetic)? In the 1960s, based on computational experiment, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectured that, for a class of polynomial equations (corresponding to elliptic curves), the vanishing of the Hasse-Weil zeta function at the center of its symmetry reveals the existence of infinitely many solutions. This research project aims to deepen the understanding of Diophantine equations in the direction pioneered by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (B-SD) conjecture.<br/><br/>The  project is to study rational algebraic cycles (a natural high dimensional generalization of the concept of rational solutions to Diophantine equations) and their connection to the special values of L-functions over both functional fields and number fields. The theorems of Gross-Zagier and of Kolyvagin proved the B-SD conjecture when the analytic rank of the Hasse-Weil L-function of an elliptic curve is at most one. One of the PI?s goals is to establish the same type of results in certain high dimensional cases: the case of the  Gan-Gross-Prasad cycles from the product of unitary Shimura varieties, and the new case arising from a symmetric pair of reductive groups. This would establish new cases of conjectures of Beilinson, Bloch, and Kato. Another goal of the project is to study special cycles on the moduli space of Shtukas, which is likely to shed light on the B-SD conjecture over function fields.  The methods in the project are from the theory of automorphic L-functions and of relative trace formula, algebro-geometric technique for cycles and moduli spaces, and techniques from harmonic analysis and representation theory of reductive groups over local fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since each of these devices has its own individual Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA) communications output, this has also resulted in an explosion of data for renewable energy system operators. The data from a SCADA system can have enormous value for renewable energy system owners, operators, and the greater community. Therefore, the Center for Renewable Energy Advanced Technological Education (CREATE), in collaboration with industry and academic partners, aims to advance the use of SCADA technology for the energy sector.  SCADA technology is of crucial importance to the electric industry to manage the extraordinary growth in renewable energy installations, while also ensuring the security and resilience of our nation's electric grid.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to advance renewable energy education by enabling faculty leaders to integrate SCADA into existing energy technician educational programs. SCADA systems are core technology for the operation of many key industrial processes, including oil and gas refining, food and beverage production, water treatment, and electric power production. SCADA systems allow engineering technicians to control systems in real time, and log data for monitoring of system performance. SCADA data analytics allow for system optimization, preventive maintenance scheduling, and for rapid detection and correction of faults and alarms to prevent or minimize system downtime.  This project will result in the creation of an educational open source SCADA system that will be deployed and shared among participating colleges and universities nationwide. Technician education in SCADA technology will be advanced through a series of professional development workshops for college and university faculty, and SCADA instructional activities will be integrated into existing courses and curricula for undergraduate energy technician education programs. The project will have enormous impact on the renewable energy sector, ultimately benefitting society by providing more reliable and lower cost energy to consumers, while creating a more resilient energy grid and reducing the environmental impact of America's energy sector.

Position and momentum coordinates are recorded in a higher dimensional space and the equations connecting position and momentum are kept track of in a geometric structure on the space. Powerful techniques were developed in the 1980s and 1990s to study these symplectic geometric spaces, but many fundamental questions remain unsolved. For example, we do not yet understand all of the surfaces that can be found inside these spaces. This project will explore such fundamental questions and develop new techniques for understanding symplectic spaces and for extracting their properties. The PI will share these new techniques with diverse groups of young mathematicians to bring the entering generation of students into cutting edge research. Activities included in this project will provide training in effective communication for students, to promote global collaborations, to engage the public in mathematics, and to ensure our scientific progress can effectively build off of work done by our predecessors and peers.<br/><br/>There are three main scientific goals of this project. The first is to make progress on the longstanding symplectic isotopy problem, studying symplectic surfaces in the complex projective plane. The new approach proposed is to reduce to singular surfaces, which allow one to obtain large degrees without large genus and thus avoid the technical roadblock that stalled progress in the early 2000s. The second goal is to utilize Lefschetz fibrations to study questions arising in algebraic geometry and singularity theory from the symplectic topological perspective. Lefschetz fibrations have been an effective tool to construct and calculate invariants of symplectic manifolds, and the PI plans to apply this effective tool to open conjectures and new lines of research related to complex algebraic geometry. The third goal is to develop the emerging technique of arboreal skeleta to study Weinstein manifolds through topological methods utilizing a simple collection of singularity types.

These properties of thermal expansion and thermal softening are similar in steels (which are mostly iron), and are important for the engineering of machines, infrastructure, or devices of any size. Perhaps surprisingly, in 2019 it is not known how to calculate the thermal expansion of iron (or its thermal softening). Some of the parts of the story, and some relations between them, are known in principle. For example, atoms vibrate more vigorously with increasing temperature, and small details about atom vibrations make a big difference in how iron expands and softens. A big challenge for iron, however, is that its magnetism also changes with temperature. The vibrations of iron atoms are affected by the change in magnetism, and proper calculations of these effects are only emerging today. This project will complete this story by experiments. It will measure the vibrations of iron atoms, obtaining the full spectrum of their vibrational frequencies. Measurements will be performed at temperatures from -258 C to +800 C, simultaneously at pressures varying from 1 atmosphere to 90,000 atmospheres. Obtaining high temperatures and high pressures simultaneously and precisely is the technical challenge. It will be undertaken with diamond anvil pressure cells. The vibrational spectra of very small samples (less than 0.1 mm in size) in the pressure cells will be measured with synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. The PI expects to learn how the change in magnetism with temperature and pressure alters the thermal expansion of iron. Other materials such as Invar may be studied in a similar way if time permits. Some of the concepts about atom vibrations, and how they influence the thermodynamics of materials, are appropriate for video content. Some public video instruction is already available. It will be organized, and new content added, to make it useful for teaching. A high school intern will be mentored during the summer, and the PI will also help support Girls Who Code to teach computer programming to underrepresented students in Pasadena middle schools.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This experimental project on bcc (alpha) iron will obtain thermodynamic quantities underlying the equation of state V(T,P) by measuring the entropy of vibrations at different combinations of P (pressure), T (temperature), and V (volume) in the sample. Diamond anvil cells are required to obtain the pressures, and the sample in the pressure cell must be heated or cooled.  The main effort will be inelastic nuclear resonant x-ray scattering (NRIXS) of 57Fe, with samples at simultaneous pressure and temperature.  NRIXS can determine the phonon density of states and hence the vibrational entropy. Simultaneous measurements of nuclear forward scattering will show  changes in the magnetism, and diffraction will give the specific volume.  Thermodynamic relationships can  give the thermal expansion, beta, and the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus, dB/dT, but now the individual contributions from vibrations, magnetism and electrons can be identified separately, and usefully compared to the total entropy known from calorimetry. Both beta and dB/dT are interesting for iron because they should be altered by interactions between atom vibrations and magnetism. Support from ab initio theory is proposed through a collaboration.  The PI now teaches his course on phase transitions in materials using a flipped classroom pedagogy. As part of this work, he will curate and develop video content to convey essential concepts in entropy, free energy and phase transformations in materials for distribution on public video platforms such as YouTube. A high school intern will be mentored during the summer. The PI will also support Girls Who Code to teach computer programming to underrepresented students in Pasadena middle schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One class of problems addresses the evolution of random surfaces according to the KPZ equation, named after its discoverers, Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang. Random surfaces have attracted a lot of recent attention in probability theory, and there are many unanswered questions. This project will aim to answer some of these questions. A second class of problems involves extending and developing a theory of lower bounds on fluctuations of random variables. Understanding fluctuations of random variables is one of the basic goals of probability theory, but there are many important problems where existing methods do not give desirable results. The PI aims to make some progress in this area by providing a new set of tools. Finally, a third class of problems centers around understanding ultrametric spaces that arise in the study of models from statistical mechanics. The strategy of working on problems in varied areas of probability theory at the same time has the potential of uncovering new connections.<br/><br/>The problems concerning the KPZ evolution are mainly about producing a solution of the equation in 2D. This would be an important breakthrough because the task of constructing any solution for the 2D KPZ equation has remained intractable so far. The results about fluctuation lower bounds would give the optimal conditions under which the current best lower bounds can be proved for planar growth models.  Previously, such lower bounds required restrictive conditions. The proposed method of solution is based on a novel coupling, which may be of independent interest. The research on ultrametricity will shed light on the hierarchical organization of states in spin glass models, especially for models with full replica symmetry breaking. It will also introduce a novel connection between the study of these models and tools from graph theory such as Szemeredi's regularity lemma.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to study the usability and user psychological comfort of an ankle exoskeleton during its interactions with its user. The device will be programmed to provide dynamic support as people walk and change walking speeds. The long term goals are to develop technology that infers and anticipates its user's intent, and to use that information to adapt the exoskeleton's behavior to maximize the user's trust in the exoskeletal system and the human-exoskeletal ""fluency"", defined as the synchronized meshing of actions within the human-technology team.  Human-exoskeleton fluency results from the co-adaptation between the human and exoskeleton, driven by the motor strategies selected by the human when using the system and by the updates in the control policy based on the human. The goal of this project is to examine how uncertainty in the timing and presence of assistive force actuations impacts human-exoskeleton fluency and human trust in the exoskeletal system. This research will be impactful both for military applications, where high rates of musculoskeletal overuse injury threaten military readiness, and for industrial applications, where muscle strains, sprains, and tears cause about one third of the reported cases of lost work days.  By integrating models of user intent, human trust, and human-exoskeleton fluency with the Dephy Bionic Boot, this project will advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health by exploring fundamental relationships human behavior, motor control, and machine manipulation within the context of exoskeletal gait assistance.  The project supports K-5, undergraduate and graduate education through outreach, curriculum development, and mentorship.<br/><br/>As a first step towards developing an anticipatory assistive exoskeleton controller that co-adapts with its human user, the specific objective of the proposed research is to test the hypotheses that human trust and human-exoskeleton fluency are affected by (1) assistive force transition timing and (2) early, late, or missed actuations within the gait cycle.  This project has three aims. The first seeks to evaluate the effect of variations in assistive force transition timing on human-exoskeleton fluency.  The second evaluates how uncertainty in the timing and presence of assistive force actuations impacts human performance and system trust. The third  aim develops a co-adaptive controller that seeks to continuously increase fluency in real-time. The research team uses the commercially available Dephy Bionic Boot with custom control algorithms to permit hypothesis evaluation. The study will be performed within a CAREN virtual reality environment on a split-belt, instrumented treadmill that permits self-pacing. Subjects will perform speed changing tasks while also performing dual tasks and responding to questions designed to probe situation awareness.

Among non-volatile memory technologies, resistive random access memory based on metal oxide films as resistive switching layers has the potential for high-speed, low operation voltage, low power consumption, and good endurance properties that enable the highest performance at the lowest cost. However, metal oxide resistive random access memory also faces some critical challenges such as the unpredictable forming process. Another challenge is the variable resistive states from one film to another and from one point to another across each film. The collaborative project between the US team (Univ. at Buffalo and Purdue) and the UK team (Univ. of Cambridge) will develop a highly innovative, scalable, and advanced materials technology to overcome the current technical limitations of emerging resistive memory. The materials platform is HfO2, a widely used material in the semiconductor industry. Unlike previous work on this material, the current project will precisely engineer HfO2 microstructures in new ways to create highly controlled switching properties. The broader technological impacts are built on established industry collaborations. The research program is well integrated with education and outreach programs at all three campuses, including: 1) training young researchers with multidisciplinary research skills in an international research environment; 2) implementing resistive memory concepts in materials science and engineering curricula through teaching; 3) disseminating research findings to broader audiences through outreach programs.<br/><br/>While commonly-used metal/metal oxide/metal structures for resistive random access memory have conduction filaments that are nucleated randomly, the design in this project incorporates engineered vertical interfaces in either vertically aligned nanocomposite or fine-grained columnar structures to guide the conduction channels. These pre-defined interfaces enable the formation of precise and non-random vertical conducting paths with high densities for high performance resistive random access memory, without the need for a high voltage forming process. This project advances knowledge by combining well-integrated capabilities to synthesize, characterize, design, and fabricate resistive random access memory devices with targeted properties and performance. Specifically, it will translate the ideal engineered materials systems which has been already demonstrated by this team in epitaxial nanocomposites to simple binary oxides such as HfO2 on Si. These films will be initially grown by pulsed laser deposition. The knowledge learned from the films grown by pulsed laser deposition will be then implemented to industrial tools of sputtering and atomic layer deposition to achieve nanoengineered HfO2-based films with ~few nm sized columnar-grains. Finally, individual memristors and crossbar array structures will be fabricated, and the key parameters of the devices characterized. Furthermore, a set of unique characterization tools will be used to reveal the interplay between the device performance and the materials properties. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a forming-free, highly uniform, high density, low power, high on/off ratio, superior endurance resistive memory through the formation of controlled oxygen vacancy concentration and perfect conducting channels in resistive switching metal oxide layers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ergodic theory studies abstractly what kinds of randomness are possible in such a process, where two processes are regarded as equivalent if either can be obtained by a suitable encoding of the other.  However, many random phenomena of great importance in modern coding theory, statistics, and data science do not arise in the linear fashion that is dictated by the arrow of time in a stationary process.  Rather, they are structured according to a large underlying network, which may itself be highly disordered.  The current project seeks to adapt methods of ergodic theory to this new setting or understand why they fail and then develop replacements.  For models of randomness governed by underlying disordered networks, some of the main issues to be investigated include: (i) whether the broad statistical features scale in a simple way with the size of the network; (ii) whether the random behavior that is visible at a particular node of the network can be estimated easily from the parameters of the model; (iii) how one can determine effectively whether a given model of network randomness can be re-encoded in some simpler form, such as pure independent noise at each node.  All of these issues arise in the theoretical underpinnings of modern research in computer and data science and could serve as a guide towards new discoveries in those fields.  The pursuit of these questions requires background knowledge from diverse parts of probability and pure mathematics, and so the current project includes plans to develop educational materials and train graduate students in a novel but valuable mix of those disciplines.<br/><br/>The project has two more specific aims. The first is the further development of the methods in the principal investigator's recent proof of the weak Pinsker theorem in ergodic theory. This theorem asserts that any stationary ergodic process may be re-encoded, in the sense of measure-theoretic isomorphism, into a nearly deterministic component and a purely random component.  The methods from the proof apply to the joint distribution of a stationary sequence of random variables, deriving a structural description from some basic information-theoretic parameters of a joint distribution.  Such implications are still in their infancy, and the proposed project would explore a range of related parameters and their consequences. The second aim concerns the broad and important class of joint distributions in combinatorics and statistical physics that are constructed over locally tree-like graphs. These models provide examples of measure-preserving actions of free groups, and conversely methods from free-group ergodic theory help to describe their asymptotic behavior. The physics literature predicts novel and consequential phenomena such as shattering and condensation, but only a few special cases have been established rigorously. The project will explore these phenomena using notions and methods from ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the Fu group is developing ultrasensitive imaging tools to probe the storage, release, and recycling of neurotransmitters.  Better understanding of these dynamics is essential to understanding neuronal function in the brain. Professor Fu's approach uses powerful imaging techniques that rely on the unique spectra of neurotransmitters to quantitatively map their distribution in model neurons. The project aligns well with the BRAIN initiative by providing missing chemical information on neurotransmission. The ultimate goal is to gain insight into the roles of various neurotransmitters in modulating brain activities in fundamental processes such as learning and memory. The Fu group is leveraging their expertise in spectroscopy and microscopy to develop demonstrations and teaching laboratory experiments targeting students across all ages, especially underrepresented minority students in local high schools and community colleges, with the goal of enhancing their physical science skills and interests for future careers in science and engineering. These activities are designed to demystify ""blackbox"" research spectrometers by using 3D printing and off-the-shelf consumer products to build cheap spectrometers for classroom use. The impact of these new instruments and labs will be amplified by online dissemination to resource-limited colleges and high schools through a dedicated website and YouTube instructional videos.<br/><br/>Existing tools for studying small molecule neurotransmitters (e.g. amperometry and cyclic voltammetry) are often limited to detection of extracellular molecules and lack the capability of quantifying spatially resolved vesicular neurotransmitter content. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is an emerging pulsed-laser chemical imaging technique that efficiently excites intrinsic molecular vibrations.  To enable use of SRS for noninvasive monitoring of the distribution and dynamics of various neurotransmitters, the Fu group is developing new SRS imaging techniques based on a combination of ultrafast laser engineering, pulse shaping, Fourier-transform detection, and new microscopy instrumentation to improve the sensitivity of SRS microscopy by 50-fold. This improvement will enable measurement of neurotransmitter content of single vesicles and multiplex detection of different neurotransmitters in neuronal cells. Following validation by electrochemical measurements, the approach will provide the first nonperturbative measurements of neurotransmitter distribution, release percentage, and recycling time in model neuronal cells. The educational plan of this CAREER proposal focuses on developing low-cost, modular instruments and designing science labs to fill unmet needs in (1) educating undergraduate students on fundamentals of instrument science and technology, and (2) enhancing academic preparation of underrepresented minority (URM) high school students for STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interplay between computational exploration and chemical synthesis allows for the design and synthesis of colloidal quantum emitters that can serve as building blocks in nano-electronic devices in a rational and scalable fashion. Current lead halide perovskite nanocrystals suffer from two main shortcomings with respect to coherent single photon emission, namely instability of the lattice and competitive dephasing. The team synthesizes and investigates new ligands and inorganic shells to suppress the dynamic twinning within the crystal and to rigidify the lattice to diminish phononic coupling, aiming to increase photon coherence times. Optimizations in composition and geometry are explored to yield faster lifetimes and improved photon purity. Construction of colloidal nano-assemblies are used to decrease lifetimes, paving the way for the development of a family of emitters with transform limited emission.

Molecular ions are molecules that are either missing electrons (and therefore are positively charged) or have extra electrons (making them negatively charged).  Neutral free-radical molecules are not charged, but have electrons that are unpaired.  The charge on a molecule and whether or not it has unpaired electrons greatly influences the chemical reactivity of the molecule. The Lewandowski laboratory has developed laser cooling and ion trapping instruments that can precisely control the speed and energy with which the ions and radicals collide.

After a reaction experiment has taken place, all of the ions in the trap, including all product ions, are ejected into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for mass-to-charge identification. By varying the reaction time, the reaction rate is determined. The experimental data are interpreted with the help of high-level theoretical calculations of the potential energy surface.

These differences in evolutionary history can come from having inherited small changes in their gene sequences, or because they don't share all the same genes across their genomes. Determining why genomes within a species vary, and what the consequences of this variability are is important in understanding microbial diversity on Earth. It will help us better understand what knowing the species a microbe belongs to can tell us about how it will evolve or respond to environmental conditions. This fundamental biological question has practical implications for questions about the role of microbes in agriculture and public health. This research will also provide an important platform for training undergraduates, graduate students, and the postdoctoral scholars. Through its integrated educational plan, it will help provide interdisciplinary training in analyzing large-scale genomic data, a much-needed skill set. This will be done by involving students in the research, though hands-on undergraduate courses, and through teacher training and a microbial art exhibit.<br/><br/>Species delineations and the mechanisms of speciation have been notoriously challenging to study in microbes owing to pervasive horizontal gene flow, within-species variation, and cryptic ecological niches that structure microbial populations. This research will test the hypothesis that different components of the bacterial genome diversify through distinct mechanisms, which can facilitate ecological adaptation across different time scales. Using Streptomyces as a model system, this research will use genomic sequences from  more than 1,500 free-living and host-associated Streptomyces isolates from disparate environments, and integrate data on three facets of genomic heterogeneity: distribution of genetic variants, rate of gene content changes and signals of selection and neutrality. Completion of the project will reveal the extent to which a single genome carries genes with distinct ecologies and modes of evolution, and how this genomic heterogeneity contributes to success and survival in specific environments. Output from the proposed project will advance our knowledge of the origins, extent and impacts of genomic heterogeneity on microbial evolution, divergence and adaptation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continuous flow chemistry is a process in which reactants are mixed together into tubes allowing a chemical reaction to occur under precisely controlled conditions where numerous reaction conditions can be adjusted. This method is of increasing importance in the chemical industry where it is used in multi-step processes leading to the efficient production of pharmaceuticals and other value-added chemicals. With the careful experimental control offered by this technology, the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reaction time result in new relationships between chemical structure and reactivity that are not observable in traditional ""one-pot"" chemistry synthesis. Students involved in this research are investigating complex chemical reactions providing them the opportunity to express their own creative design of making natural products. The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a major tool for predicting chemical reactivity gives further insight into the nature of chemical bonds and their inherent reactivity. This research provides a fertile learning platform for both doctoral and masters graduate students to launch scientific careers that benefit society through gainful employment in academic, entrepreneurial, and industrial settings in advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research focuses on transferring successful batch chemistries to continuous flow reactions to increase selectivity, chemical diversity, and productivity with improved safety metrics. Importantly, microscale segmented flow techniques provide rapid assessment of product formation and enable continuous flow optimization as a basis for future automation. The ability to differentiate between seemingly equivalent hydroxyl groups in order to achieve specific functionalization is a major challenge for chemical synthesis development. Typically, several protection and deprotection steps are required, which increases production time and decreases step economy. In addition, many of the procedures require synthetic expertise, which limits accessibility to scientists outside the chemical synthesis arena.

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to the conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ""reciprocity law."") Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study the conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ""the Langlands program."" A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new reciprocity laws.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program. At the heart of the Langlands program is a conjectured reciprocity law relating automorphic representations to p-adic Galois representations. The precise description of the manner in which automorphic forms and Galois representations are supposed to correspond involves local reciprocity laws, that is, reciprocity laws that relate the behavior of the automorphic representation at a prime q to the behavior of the Galois representation at that same prime. These local laws are most subtle when q is taken to be the same prime p that governs the coefficients of the Galois representation; indeed, in this case such a local reciprocity law would constitute a p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and its existence remains conjectural other than in the abelian case, and the case of GL_2(Q_p). Together with various collaborators, the principal investigator aims to investigate this hoped-for but mysterious p-adic local reciprocity law in various ways. The PI's study of moduli stacks of p-adic Galois representations will provide new geometric insight into p-adic local Langlands and related problems such as the Breuil--Mezard conjecture.  The PI's proposed trace formula for p-adically completed cohomology should yield new insight into local-global compatibility in the p-adic context.  The PI's research on growth of cohomology will increase the range of applicability of stable trace formula, one of the most powerful tools available for studying reciprocity laws associated to automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With NSF funding, the School for Advanced Research (SAR), an advanced research center for anthropology and allied disciplines located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, will implement three years of research team seminars in cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and archaeology. Eligible research teams will have a primary focus on a question of anthropological importance that is timely and addresses a specific need. Seminars will be selected by an expert panel of SAR staff and external scholars through an annual competition. For each seminar, NSF funding will cover domestic and international travel, lodging, meals, and other related costs for up to 10 participants (6 U.S. and 4 international scholars) to meet in the SAR Seminar House for three days. Funding will also support a portion of SAR staff salaries to administer the project and advertising of the research team opportunity. Organizers of the research team seminars are expected to develop a meeting schedule in advance and provide SAR with a report after the seminar concludes that describes activities and results, including plans for new research, publications in peer-reviewed journals and edited volumes, and conference presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The necessity to test performance inside cells limits the possible pathways to those that are not toxic to the host cell. Unfortunately, the performance of cell-free systems has proven to be erratic, exhibiting poor reliability. This project will establish a reliable, reproducible, cell-free platform. The design-build-test cycle could be shortened dramatically if it could be accomplished in a cell-free environment.

As a collaboration with Imperial College London, this project will also promote research exchanges, providing US students with international research experiences. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to standardize cell-free systems from  engineered E. coli and other organisms.  Such systems will be used to explore the boundaries of cell-free prototyping and enable more detailed understanding of key mechanisms.

The long term vision is to establish cell-free systems as a platform for implementation of synthetic biological circuits, pathways, and systems, where modular and complex biomolecular systems can be engineered in a systematic fashion.  This project seeks to overcome some of the current limitations of cell-free systems through a combination of experimental characterization and computational modeling.  If successful, this project will expand the utility of cell-free systems to a broader class of circuits and pathways.  The specific objectives of the project are (1) the development of well-understood cell-free reaction systems suitable for prototyping circuits and pathways for a variety of cells; (2) characterization and modeling of complex synthetic biology components and core mechanisms using cell-free extracts; and (3) development of new biochemical indicator modules for monitoring and characterizing circuit performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet in order to test Einstein's great theory, it is essential to know what it actually predicts for real measurements.  This project continues a program of research to provide concrete links between the abstract beauty and complex mathematics of Einstein's theory and the real world where measurements are made by physicists and astronomers.   These links are established by finding approximate, yet accurate solutions of the equations in forms that are practical and usable.    The outcomes of this research will be used by data experts at the gravitational-wave observatories to perform better tests of general relativity using newly detected signals, and will be used by astronomers to probe how general relativity affects complex systems such as stars orbiting supermassive black holes, or three-body systems involving bodies ranging from black holes to exoplanets.   Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will contribute to the ability of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the LIGO-Virgo network to test general relativity, by computing the equations of motion for binary star systems, along with the emitted gravitational waveforms, as predicted by an important alternative theory, known as Einstein-Aether gravity, to high accuracy in the so-called post-Newtonian approximation.  It will provide accurate waveforms predicted by this theory in a format that can be adapted to LIGO-Virgo data analysis methods.   Another important question that will be addressed is whether the evolution of binary orbits with general relativistic effects included leaves any residual orbital ellipticity in the final stages, leading to observable modulations of the gravitational signals emitted. The project also extends recent work of the PI on incorporating the effects of Einstein's theory into the dynamics of three-body systems, such as a star-exoplanet system in the presence of a third body, or a binary-black-hole system in a galactic core with a supermassive black hole at its center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This theory suggests that many other types of composite particles, known as hadrons, should exist in Nature as unstable resonances. As such, this project will make possible a study of the properties of excited hadronic resonances as predicted by QCD, using large-scale computing resources.  Understanding such resonances will help us gain insight into the key physical mechanisms at work inside hadrons and nuclei.  The proposed research lends support to current experiments, such as the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab).  Scattering involving one particular hadron known as a Delta baryon will be another focus.  Detailed determinations of how the Delta baryon interacts with other particles will be crucial for experiments studying neutrinos, an important elementary particle that permeates  the universe.  The PI will mentor a graduate student engaged in this research, and the graduate student will also receive training in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources.  <br/><br/>The physics of excited hadrons and hadron-hadron interactions will be studied using Monte Carlo estimates of path integrals involving quark and gluon fields on a space-time lattice.

Leung and Mark D. Marshall of Amherst College use high speed, state-of-the-art methods to measure the microwave radiation given off by complexes formed between two individual molecules rotating together in space.  The patterns of the specific frequencies emitted is analyzed to determine the detailed shape of the complex.  The research gives fundamental information into how the two molecules are arranged with respect to each other along with precise distances and angles. This information, in turn, indicates the nature of the forces that molecules exert upon each other.  Such forces have important consequences for many chemical and biological systems, but are difficult to separate from the larger effects of the much stronger chemical bonds.  This project seeks to provide a greater understanding of intermolecular interactions.  The research also use these interactions to differentiate between mirror image molecules that have identical physical properties but different biological effects.  The undergraduate students engaged in this research receive valuable hands-on experience with state-of-the art microwave spectrometers, sophisticated data analysis, and modern quantum chemistry program packages. Additionally, they learn how to formulate questions and design the research methods. <br/><br/>This project uses both cavity-enhanced and chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy to obtain the rotational spectrum of gas-phase bimolecular heterodimers.  A macroscopic, coherent polarization is induced in the free-jet, gaseous sample via a pulse of microwave radiation, which the rotating dimers re-emit at characteristic frequencies in a free-induction decay (FID).  The FID is digitized and Fourier transformed to reveal the frequency spectrum that is analyzed to provide molecular structures.  The investigation of protic acid-haloethylene complexes tests hypotheses regarding the interplay of electrostatic and dispersion interactions with steric requirements that result in novel and unexpected structures.  Through the characterization of non-covalently bonded heterodimers formed between a chiral analyte and a small tag molecule of known chirality, which converts enantiomers of the analyte into spectroscopically-distinguishable diastereomers, the project contributes to the development of a new, improved method of chiral analysis with applications across chemistry and particularly to the pharmaceutical industry.  Called chiral tagging, the technique promises to have broad impact by providing the absolute stereochemistry of the analyte and, in a background-free manner, the enantiomeric excess of a sample.

Earth?s finite amount of water means that whenever one of these reservoirs fills, the others must empty to balance it. This simple principle - conservation of mass - has powerful implications for society's ability to understand past climate and sea-level change, and potentially for predicting these into the future. To understand the impacts of past changes in water and climate, the researchers ask a simple and fundamental set of questions: First, how did the global water balance respond to the climate of the last glacial period? Second, how did that response in turn impact the climate system through evaporation from the land, runoff into the ocean, and ecological change linked with the global distribution and function of wetlands? In this project the researchers will develop a new model that links these components of the hydrological cycle, and apply this to the recent geological past when vast ice sheets covered the high latitudes and lakes filled now-dry basins. By connecting this new model with geological data, the researchers hope to understand how changes in past sea level are distributed among ice sheets and water on the continents, including groundwater, lakes, and wetlands. They will also investigate how sudden freshwater release can impact ocean circulation and global climate. In parallel with this research, they will communicate the importance of water in the environment by sharing their digitally reconstructed ancient land- and water-scapes online, developing a watershed board game for educators, and contributing their findings to scientific journals and Wikipedia.<br/><br/>Terrestrial water storage plays a crucial role in climate, ecosystems, land-atmosphere interactions, and sea level. To date, most studies of the last deglaciation focus on changes in the ice sheets, but overlook the other components of the terrestrial hydrologic system: lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater, and permafrost. As a result the magnitude and pace of change of non-glacial terrestrial water storage - and its potential impact on the climate system - remains unknown. Here the researchers propose to reconstruct the global hydrologic environment during the last deglaciation. To do so, they will: (a) compile, integrate, and synthesize proxies for terrestrial paleohydrology since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM); (b) develop a coupled model linking glacial isostatic adjustment, lakes and rivers, and groundwater; and (c) integrate data and model to quantify the time evolution of global terrestrial hydrology. This output will allow them to quantify: (1) the migration, expansion, and contraction of surface water bodies; (2) the total amount of water stored on land and its impact on sea-level records and ice-sheet reconstructions; and (3) water inputs to the ocean through evapotranspiration and submarine groundwater discharge, alongside their potential to reconcile ice-sheet reconstructions with records of sea level and past ocean circulation. In conjunction with these research activities, the researchers will deliver their paleohydrologic reconstructions as maps available on Wikimedia Commons and Flyover Country, build instructional materials on past environments, and improve Wikipedia's coverage of hydrologic and paleoclimate science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, cellular processes, fluctuations in stock prices, weather patterns, movement of microscopic particles exhibit different types of random behaviors. Furthermore, randomness is a vital ingredient in most modern algorithms that are popular in data-science.  Hence, it is of fundamental importance that various types of randomness are properly characterized for detailed understanding of system properties. Mathematical models incorporating such randomness are typically expressed in terms of stochastic equations, which often have complex dynamics.  An important component of mathematical studies of these equations includes computer simulations of their temporal evolution, which are necessary for understanding their behavioral patterns over time. Accurate statistical estimation of some key parameters of these stochastic equations from observed data is also crucial, as it leads to the ""most appropriate mathematical model"" underlying these data points. This in turn leads to better predictive power of such models. The research supported by this award will undertake proper mathematical analyses of various numerical schemes that are used for these purposes. More specifically, research in this direction will involve precise calculations of probabilities of getting accurate results from these schemes and will describe conditions under which these probabilities are very high. There is a critical need for such theoretical results, since they will inevitably lead to design of faster and more efficient algorithms, which in turn will be beneficial to society. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will help them to gain valuable analytical and computational skills. The results of the project will be published in well-known scientific journals and will also be presented at domestic and international conferences. <br/> <br/>The research will focus on the limiting behaviors of complex stochastic systems discretized by properly scaled step sizes. Discretization is at the heart of various numerical schemes, but its effect on the desired convergence properties is not always clearly understood. For example, it is well known that approximating stationary distribution of an ergodic stochastic differential equation (SDE) by time averages of sample paths obtained from an Euler-Maruyama type discretization scheme (using fixed step-size) could be problematic. In particular, such an estimator will have a bias, which may or may not be quantifiable. These are infinite-time horizon problems, and there is a deficit of proper asymptotic results in this direction even for regular Ito-diffusions. Exploring proper scaling techniques to get desired convergence along with convergence rates for such discretization-based schemes is the central goal of this project. Stochastic models that will be considered covers switching jump-diffusion models, multiscale systems and systems of interacting SDEs with possible jumps. The last class is particularly important for understanding particle-based methods for approximating nonlinear integro-differential equations including Boltzmann-type equations. These equations are connected to appropriate systems of interacting SDEs with jumps through McKean-Vlasov type limits. The stochastic equations of interest will also include Langevin SDEs, which model dynamics of molecular systems in presence of particle interaction potential, damping and random forces, and which also play a pivotal role in certain Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.  The research puts special emphasis on large deviation asymptotics of error probabilities, which, importantly, because of presence of both upper and lower bounds, give the optimal exponential decay rate. <br/> <br/>This project is jointly funded by Probability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This diversity of cells and responses occurs when different parts of the genome are transcribed by RNA Polymerases (Pols). Understanding the function of various Pols might help us engineer organisms in beneficial ways, and will therefore have impacts on medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation. This project is focused on new Pol subunits discovered in the grass family, which includes key crops such as rice, wheat, and corn. This project will test the function of these novel Pol proteins and create genetic and biochemical tools for subsequent investigations. Additionally, this project will train a graduate student in cutting-edge biological approaches such as genome editing and analysis of high throughput sequencing data.

Grasses have additional duplications of Pol IV and Pol V subunits. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these duplicates have neofunctionalized with respect to both function and holoenzyme assembly. The goal of this project is to genetically and biochemically test whether the duplicate (paralogous) Pol subunits have diverged in function and evolved into a sixth RNA Polymerase in grasses.

One beautiful example of such fractals is the Apollonian gasket which is constructed by a theorem proven by the ancient Greek geometer Apollonius.

Recent data from 2018 suggest that only one-third of teachers teaching science in NYS are prepared to teach their subject area, and in NYC, 31 percent of Earth science teachers are not certified to teach in their subject area. The current shortage of science teachers prevents many schools from offering any Earth science courses, severely limiting students' opportunities to prepare for the NYS Regents Examination in Earth science, accumulate credits required to graduate, or prepare for higher education opportunities or careers in this field. The AMNH Master of Arts in Teaching program prepares and supports teachers in high-need schools and, through this project, will support two cohorts of 15 Fellows each over the six-year grant period. Fellows will be supported through matriculation of the master's degree program and through induction as they enter their four years of teaching in high-need schools. The project will also generate improved understanding about high-leverage culturally responsive teaching practices and their impact in diverse high-need settings. <br/><br/>In partnership with four NYC- and Yonkers-based schools (Midwood High School, Bronx Early College Academy, Hunters Point Community Middle School, in NYC, and Roosevelt High School, in Yonkers), the project will recruit a total of 30 Earth science post-baccalaureate candidates to prepare them as highly-qualified and diverse Earth science teachers. The project aims to advance research and practice in the field of STEM teacher preparation and retention by helping to examine and develop program practice in three areas: 1) identifying effective strategies for recruiting a diverse body of candidates for STEM teaching; 2) providing a deeper articulation of what strong preparation for science teaching looks like, including, specifically, what culturally responsive teaching looks like in STEM classrooms; and 3) situating the learning of high-leverage science teaching practices in coursework. Program results will be shared broadly through professional publications, conferences, study groups, and online contexts as well as informal networks of research colleagues. The project's two cohorts of teachers have the potential to have a positive impact on learning and outcomes for approximately 3,000 students annually (assuming 100 students per teacher) in high-need schools, with the majority likely to be working in NYC, one of the largest and most diverse school districts in the country. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some plants can extend their roots substantially below the surface to take advantage of ground water, giving them a moisture reservoir that persists through dry seasons and droughts.  When plants tap into this reservoir they transpire moisture through their leaves, providing a source of moisture to the atmosphere at a time when the air may be at its driest. The extent to which this transpired groundwater influences meteorological conditions such as precipitation, cloudiness, and atmospheric stability is not known, nor is its dependence on region, season, and other factors.<br/><br/>The transpiration of groundwater involves a complex set of biological and physical processes which are difficult to observe and simulate. But the PIs have developed a scheme in which the bulk effect of these processes can be approximated using two observationally-motivated assumptions. First, the extent to which plants extend their roots to tap groundwater depends on their position relative to the local topography.  In dry or seasonally dry climates plants on a hilltop are typically too high above the water table to effectively access groundwater, so we can assume that they rely exclusively on near-surface soil moisture.  At the valley floor the water table can be so close to the surface that plant roots have to be shallow to avoid excessive salinity and waterlogging, so they also rely exclusively on near-surface moisture.  Thus maximum groundwater uptake occurs at mid-hillslope locations, and groundwater usage depends on the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND). The PIs have developed a ""giant hillslope"" method to quantify this dependence in terms of a five-bin representation of small-scale HAND topography.<br/><br/>Second, roots respond dynamically to the vertical profile of soil water.  The PIs argue that root dynamics can be simply represented by assuming that roots actively extend to reach available groundwater, taking up water from whatever level offers the greatest moisture access for the least effort. This assumption is formalized using a scheme in which the transport of moisture through roots is analogous to the movement of electric current in a circuit: the roots act as ""wires"", through which a ""current"" of moisture flows from a specific soil layer to the plant leaves, driven by the ""voltage"" difference (i.e. water potential difference) between plant leaves and the soil layer tapped by the roots. The flow of moisture from a soil layer to the surface is then given by the ratio of the layer-to-leaves voltage drop to the resistance of the wire, in exact analogy to Ohm's law (electric current equals voltage divided by resistance).<br/><br/>The PIs implement their root-groundwater scheme in the Noah land-surface model, which is coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to form a coupled land-atmosphere model.  The model is then used to test the impact of groundwater transpiration on the continental-scale hydrological cycle.  Among the scientific questions to be addressed is the extent to which groundwater transpiration promotes precipitation, both by making a substantial contribution to the moisture available for precipitation, and by reducing atmospheric stability.<br/><br/>The research has societal value due to the importance of the hydrological cycle for water resources. The work is of particular value for building bridges between the research communities concerned with the separate but closely connected fields of land surface hydrology, continental-scale hydroclimate, and plant ecology.  The implementation of the new scheme in the WRF model will make it available for operational use, as WRF is widely used for weather forecasting.  The PIs also conduct educational and outreach activities in K-12 schools, and the project supports two graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, quantification of risk of extreme outcomes is of central concern in many problems in finance, economics, environmental science, geophysics, and engineering. The mathematical framework for studying such problems is given by the theory of large deviations which is concerned with the characterization of decay rate of probabilities of deviations of a system with uncertainties from its nominal expected behavior. In the last twenty years a new approach to the study of large deviations problems, that brings to bear techniques from the theory of stochastic control, has become prominent. The goal of this research is to develop a systematic framework based on stochastic control ideas for an important and challenging class of large deviation problems that arise in the study of interacting particle systems. Interacting particle systems considered here are motivated by phenomena in Natural Sciences. Some examples include models for chemotaxis of biological particles, reaction-diffusion systems arising from ecological models, and crystal growth models from chemistry. In addition to developing the mathematical machinery for providing asymptotic bounds on decay rate of rare event probabilities, this work will develop accelerated Monte-Carlo methods for estimating probabilities of interest using methods of importance sampling that are inspired by a large deviation analysis of the underlying systems.<br/><br/><br/>This project will study four different families of particle systems: (A) Weakly interacting diffusions with a small common noise; (B) Microscopic particle models for Patlak-Keller-Segel equations; (C) Brownian particle systems for reaction-diffusion equations; (D) Locally interacting jump-diffusions. Under topic (A), the focus will be on large deviation asymptotics as the number of particles becomes large and the intensity of the common noise becomes small. The goal is to characterize different forms of large deviation behavior as the two parameters approach limits at different relative rates. Patlak-Keller-Segal equations in topic (B) are nonlinear non-local PDE that model active chemotaxis of biological particles. Interacting diffusive particle systems that are fully coupled with the evolution of the underlying chemical field have been used to give a mesoscopic description of the phenomenon. Goal of the proposed research here is to study large deviation problems aimed at understanding the long time behavior of such particle systems. In particular, this work will study invariant measure asymptotics and metastability behavior near a rest point. Under topic (C), large deviations behavior of particle systems of reaction-diffusion type will be studied. Of particular interest are annihilating Brownian particles approximating reaction diffusion equations with a polynomial reaction term in which the interaction becomes singular in the limit. Finally topic (D) is concerned with locally interacting particle systems on discrete lattices with a suitable temporal and spatial scaling. Such systems arise, for example, as crystal growth models in chemistry. The goal is to develop stochastic control methods for studying large deviation properties of such systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team is taking advantage of high throughput robotics and ""ligand libraries"" to test large numbers of new catalysts rapidly and safely. Due to the strong collaboration with industry, this project results in excellent work experience for the next generation of scientists. Coworkers on this project include those from historically underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Catalysis with first row transition metals, particularly iron and cobalt, as alternatives to precious metals is attractive. In addition to the potential cost and environmental benefits, these metals have often been shown to exhibit superior performance in terms of activity, selectivity, solvent profile as well as their unique abilities to produce new transformations. This research, conducted in collaboration with the chemical company Merck, focuses on understanding the mechanisms of first row transition metals in catalysis relevant to drug synthesis. Specific reactions of interest include methods for the stereoselective preparation of versatile polyboron compounds, asymmetric chain-running reactions to set remote stereocenters, and alcohol activation reactivity.

Surprisingly, there is still a limited understanding of why these tissues are able to survive so remarkably well for many decades in young individuals as well as why the tissue is more likely to degenerate in older individuals or those exposed to abnormal joint activities (e.g., athletes, those with physically intensive occupations). This project investigates the existence of an intriguing molecular mechanism that may account for the ability of musculoskeletal tissues to protect themselves, even when faced with the challenging mechanical environment of intense physiologic joint activity. The project will examine the ability of mechanical joint activity to activate, or turn on, a powerful signaling molecule called transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) that resides inside all musculoskeletal tissues in a latent (inactive) form. This TGF-b activation, in turn, signals cells to generate more tissue proteins, leading to a critical, need-based repair response. This mechanism may explain the resilience of musculoskeletal tissues in young individuals as well as the degeneration that comes with aging or excessive activity. This project expands upon the PI?s track record of promoting research training for under-represented students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Further, the research will be incorporated into education outreach modules that promote the field of mechanobiology to under-represented K-12 student groups. <br/><br/>The TGF-b-mediated mechanobiological repair mechanism will be examined in an in vitro model, consisting of the long-term mechanical stimulation of explanted tissues of bovine articular cartilage.

The in vitro model will then be expanded to utilize human articular cartilage explants of varying age ranges to assess the potential efficacy loss of this mechanism with aging.

To realize that potential, however, methods for assuring the safe operation of those systems are needed. This project addresses this pressing need. Consider the increasing presence of self-driving capabilities in automobiles.  They issue warnings when the car drifts outside of the lane and can initiate corrective steering actions.  To do this, they employ a neural network to analyze images from a forward-facing camera to detect, for example, the lines that demark lane boundaries.  A flaw in this neural network might, for instance, initiate a steering action in the wrong direction and thereby lead to vehicle damage or passenger injury.  This project develops techniques for assuring that machine learning produces neural networks that come with guarantees about their behavior.  Those guarantees can, in turn, be relied upon when determining that the overall system will operate safely.  <br/><br/>To achieve verifiably safe machine learning, this project leverages the growing body of work on symbolic verification algorithms for neural networks.  These algorithms are cost-prohibitive when applied to existing neural networks. The approach taken in this project searches for and automatically generates an alternative neural network architecture that allows for an appropriate balance between the accuracy of the network and the tractability of verification.  Once it finds such an architecture, it employs an iterative counterexample guided refinement approach to training the architecture which results in neural networks that meet essential safety guarantees.

A more sustainable energy economy may be achievable with photocatalysts that can produce hydrogen fuel from water, using sunlight as the only energy input. Hydrogen is regarded as a ""green"" fuel because it releases its stored energy by re-forming water. A problem of known photocatalysts is that their energy conversion efficiency is low, that is, they absorb a lot of energy from sunlight but only some of this energy is converted to a usable fuel.  This project studies the use of ""ferroelectric"" light absorbers to increase the energy conversion efficiency. The new ferroelectric light absorbing materials are studied using microscopic, optical, electrical, and chemical methods. The research is conducted by a postdoctoral associate and by graduate students. All team members are trained in the preparation of the materials and in the application of modern instruments and techniques for their characterization. New internship positions for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups are also created. Chemistry shows at local schools and on campus motivate children to study the natural sciences, tackling important societal problems like clean energy. Experimental demonstrations are distributed as online materials to educate the public about sustainable fuel research.<br/><br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Osterloh of the University of California, Davis, is studying ferroelectric effects in a set of photocatalyst materials derived from the perovskites M:ATiO3.

These materials are relevant to the development of third generation photovoltaic devices and photocatalysts for the production of sustainable energy. The compounds are synthesized with solid state and hydrothermal methods from abundant elements, and they are characterized with electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV/vis spectroscopy. Site-selective modification with water oxidation and reduction co-catalysts is applied to fabricate ferroelectric photocatalysts for the overall water splitting reaction. A combination of dielectric polarization experiments, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, photocatalytic, and electrochemical measurements is used to determine the extent to which ferroelectric dipoles can enhance photochemical energy to fuel conversion with these materials. Additionally, the project trains graduate, postgraduate and undergraduate students in the preparation of inorganic materials and advanced methods for characterizing their morphology, structure and photochemistry.

This energy learning is the foundation for informed decision-making about sustainable and just use of energy resources. Energy issues are not only issues of science and technology, but must be integrated with civics, history, economics, sociology, psychology, and politics to understand and solve modern energy problems. Placing the scientific concept of energy in this social context presents an opportunity to advance science education as equitable and culturally responsive.    <br/><br/>This project will create a model for secondary science teacher professional development that integrates science concepts with equity education. This model promotes a key epistemological issue: that science concepts are not culture-free or socially neutral ideas, but rather are concepts created and sustained by people in specific times and places for the purposes of (1) addressing specific social needs and (2) empowering people or groups of people. The two major components of the project are (1) the professional development  experience, including both an intensive in-person summer workshop and an online professional learning community, and (2)an energy and equity portal, including an instructional materials library, an action research exchange, and a community forum for teacher discussions. The portal will provide technical resources to support the PLC, including support for sharing instructional materials and reporting on action research. The research plan includes exploratory, development and application phases. The researchers will identify teacher learning in the first iteration of PD, collect and analyze the instructional artifacts to inform how teacher engage with, participate in, and build an understanding energy as a historically and politically situated science concept. A team of scholar-videographers will observe, taking real-time field notes and making daily memos. The research team will use the instructional artifacts, video recordings, field notes, and memos as a basis for analysis through the next academic year. The result will be a nationally significant community of teacher-leaders and library of research-tested instructional materials that are responsive to students' scientific ideas, relevant to socio-political concerns about energy sustainability, respectful of students' cultures, and open to all students no matter their cultural background. Teachers participating in the project will learn to explain how scientific concepts of energy reflect culturally specific values, analyze socio-politically relevant energy scenarios, learn the historic and present-day inequities in the energy industry and in science participation, and be supported in preparing instruction for secondary students that is culturally responsive and relevant to their students' communities.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

Each such moduli space can be thought of as a universe of all possible shapes that a surface can take.

The first part of this project aims to obtain classification results for these orbits. Such classification results would provide a table of possible behaviors, and would give deep information about the surfaces themselves. This information could be used in more concrete mathematical and physical applications involving dynamics and polygonal shapes. The second part of this project aims to give insight into the mapping class group, which encodes all ways of wrapping a surface onto itself, as well as four dimensional shapes called surface bundles. Aspects of this research provide an ideal training ground for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and connect to the principal investigator's ongoing efforts to further popularize Maryam Mirzakhani's inspiring work in this area. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI proposes to engage in research at the intersection of Teichmueller theory and dynamics, in two related programs. The first program concerns GL+(2,R) orbit closures of quadratic and Abelian differentials, also known as (half) translation surfaces. The principal investigator proposes to classify orbit closures that have large rank, by employing recent theorems concerning cylinder deformations and degenerations developed by the principal investigator and his coauthors, as well as the seminal results of Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi. In the second program, the principal investigator proposes to investigate convex cocompact surface subgroups of the mapping class group, employing dynamical and geometric results concerning the Teichmueller geodesic flow.

The second project and third projects study the structures of large financial systems that are interacting in a centralized (mean-field) and non-centralized (network) manner, respectively. The results will provide tools for the measurement and management of systemic risk, particularly default contagion for large scale interbank lending markets, both for individual investors and for regulators. The award will also result in the involvement and training of graduate students and dissemination through journal publications and conferences. <br/><br/>The first project will develop efficient Monte-Carlo methods  for high-dimensional PDEs and path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). These schemes are expected to be efficient when the dimension of the equations is allowed to be in the hundreds or higher, hence essentially breaking the notorious ""curse of dimensionality"" that has been baffling the numerical analysts and computer scientists for decades. The second project explore various theoretical issues as well as several practical problems in stochastic game/control theory and quantitative finance under the general framework of master equations and their variations. This project will utilize several recently developed technical tools, including the time consistency principle and the dynamic utility approach. The third project on dynamic systemic risk investigates a complex network in which the contagion effect among banks are described in a time-consistent, and non-centralized manner. By considering the state space of probability measures, the dynamical movements of networks can be described by measure-valued SDEs, while the systemic risk is characterized by certain master equations. All projects in the proposed research have direct or indirect connections to applied fields, especially to stochastic finance/actuarial sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This concept is also thought to be at the core of how metabolism functions in life. A team of genes/enzymes are organized by directions from a transcription factor to function as a cohesive unit. Understanding how biological modules function is essential for all efforts to either engineer or improve organisms for nearly any purpose. However, this concept has not actually been tested. This project uses genome engineering approaches to cause individual genes to lose their ability to function as a gene and test how the module functions. This effort trains graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to integrate synthetic biology engineering with genomics and computational data analysis. The project provides direct research experience to first-generation and transfer undergraduate researchers to broaden the future pool of researchers.<br/><br/>This project tests a foundational assumption of biology, that the members of a network are coordinately regulated to optimize the trait being produced by the network and to maximize efficiency. However, it is not clear that all of the genes in a holoenzyme or metabolic pathway need to be coordinated or that there is some threshold at which genes can be dropped from a regulatory module without functional consequence. This project uses genome engineering to directly test this theory by manipulating promoters to remove genes and pathways from specific regulons. The effect of these manipulations is measured with a wide array of phenotyping platforms to test consequences at all levels of a trait from transcript to metabolite to whole organism. These results allow a direct empirical test of how module membership at the holoenzyme, pathway or super-pathway level influences those modules' function. The project directly measures how many members of a regulon must be coordinated to create the proper trait response. These results contribute to the development of new theories and concepts to improve the understanding of how organisms function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop an efficient 'writing' method by discovering novel properties in magnetic materials. It is well-known that when an electrical current passes through a magnetic thin film, a voltage develops at two sides of the magnetic film transverse to the electrical current.  This so-called anomalous Hall effect is broadly used in magnetic field sensors.  By asking the question of what happens at the top and bottom surfaces of the magnetic films, it was discovered that the magnetization directions, like the direction from south Pole to north pole of a refrigerator magnet, of the magnetic film are tilted out of the film plane at both surfaces.  The principle behind this effect will be investigated and the effect will be used to develop a much more efficient and less energy consuming 'write' process for next generation memory chips.  Research based education and outreach are also an integral part of this project.  Leveraging newly established state-of-the-art Nanofabrication Facility at University of Delaware, several experiment modules will be developed in order to teach about magnetic device fabrication.   This project is not only interesting in  scientific and technical developments, but also will have long lasting impacts on work force training for maintaining the United States' technological edge in the global economy.    <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can convert a charge current into a spin current, enabling electrical control of magnetization.  A quintessential example of SOC-induced transport in a ferromagnetic conductor (FM) is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), in which an electric current perpendicular to the magnetization generates a transverse spin current and charge accumulations on the surface. Applying similar considerations to the configuration of a current parallel to the magnetization, SOC should also give rise to a transverse spin current with spins orthogonal to both the magnetization and spin current.  The transverse spins precess rapidly about the magnetization direction and exert torque on the magnetization as they dephase, in analogy with the spin transfer torque.  This transverse spin Hall effect (TSHE), named to distinguish from the SHE in a heavy metal, is experimentally confirmed and it leads to anomalous spin-orbit torque (ASOT) on the top and bottom surfaces of a FM.  This project aims to understand (1) the mechanisms for ASOT, (2) the TSHE-induced spin orbit torque (SOT) behavior on a ferrimagnet (FiM) with perpendicular anisotropy (PMA), particularly at the angular moment compensation temperature at which the spin dynamics are governed by the antiferromagnetic coupling, and (3) the spin dynamics induced by ASOT in a single FM and SOT in a PMA FiM.  This proposal is built on recent experimental breakthroughs in revealing ASOT behaviors in a single FM as well as a MOKE-based SOT characterization technique that was upgraded with time-resolved and temperature capability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  This study examines how the diet of an animal can help it survive attacks from other animals.  The Fellow studies the fall webworm, a caterpillar that eats the leaves of different trees.  Fall webworms are attacked by parasitic insects that lay their eggs inside the caterpillar and use it as a host.  The caterpillar's immune system can help defend against these parasitic insects, but the strength of the immune system can be affected by the caterpillar's diet.  The Fellow uses experiments and field surveys in Colorado to understand whether different trees increase the immunity of the fall webworm against wasp attacks.  The survival of insects, like many animals, is dependent on the plants in their habitat.  As changes in climate transform many plant communities, insects are likely to be affected too. This study will increase understanding of how plant-insect interactions might change if major climatic events drastically modify plant communities.  In addition, the Fellow works closely with youth from underrepresented minority students from urban areas in Denver.  Students will participate in wildlife surveys, which increase awareness of wildlife. The fellow will also promote opportunities for mentorship and guidance by creating an online network of biologists from minority backgrounds who will advise high school students. <br/><br/>For widely distributed animals, the relative importance of diet and natural enemies can vary depending on location and composition of ecological communities.  The Fellow will use genomics to identify and quantify the diversity of parasitic insects attacking fall webworm across its range in Colorado. Next, the Fellow will use lab experiments to measure the relationship between diet and the nutrient quality of fall webworms.  Finally, the Fellow will manipulate the caterpillar's diet to examine how different tree species impact the caterpillar's ability to launch immune defenses against parasitic insects.  This research includes two approaches to increase interactions with nature among underrepresented minority students in urban public schools. First, the Fellow will use an experiential learning model to create interactive out-of-school learning opportunities for middle school students. Second, the Fellow will build an online network of professional biologists who agree to be mentors for high school students with interests in biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Swift advances in the field of spintronics - an emergent discipline that aims to take advantage of the intrinsic spin of electron in addition to its electric charge for computing and data storage - present new challenges for mathematical modeling, analysis and simulations of these materials, which need to keep pace with the progress in material design. The aim of this project is to provide efficient theoretical treatments of the next generation of magnetic materials within the general micromagnetic modeling framework down to nanoscale. Its focus on magnetic skyrmions and other coherent structures is strongly motivated by the ongoing development of new spintronic hardware for neuromorphic computing inspired by biological neural networks and particularly suited for deep learning.  The nonlinear, nonlocal and multiscale nature of the problems make it into a formidable problem of the 21st century applied mathematics. Nevertheless, both the need to develop new mathematical and computational tools to tackle the genuine complexity of these systems and their potential to revolutionize computer technologies make these fundamental challenges very exciting. <br/><br/>The investigator undertakes a combination of modeling, analytical, asymptotic and computational studies of layered ferromagnetic materials of current interest to spintronic applications. Due to the increased dominance of interfacial effects at nanoscale, the three-dimensional micromagnetic modeling framework must incorporate new types of boundary terms. This new physics often results in surprising effects near the material boundaries and gives rise to novel types of edge magnetization structures such as edge-curling walls, edge vortices and chiral bobbers. The investigator plans to formulate micromagnetic models of ferromagnetic films that exhibit interfacial magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, derive the reduced two-dimensional models appropriate for thin films and develop efficient computational tools to simulate current and stochastically driven systems. Next, within the obtained class of the reduced models, the investigator plans to undertake a study of several types of coherent structures supported by these materials, such as magnetic skyrmions in extended and patterned ultrathin films, spin textures in nanowires, and various edge structures. The questions of existence and asymptotic properties of these coherent structures give rise to challenging problems of energy-driven pattern formation and calculus of variations. A key component of the project is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians into this highly interdisciplinary area of research. As part of this process, the investigator develops courses in applied sciences and takes part in interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs. It is hoped that the project will also help foster better interactions between applied mathematicians and experimentalists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is focused on investigating the structure and dynamics of polymer catenanes. Mechanically-interlocked macromolecules (MIMs) such as DNA and protein catenanes are macromolecular assemblies that can be thought of as being held together by a kind of ""mechanical bond"" formed from interlocking rings rather than usual direct chemical bonds. This novel structure is expected to exhibit unique properties, particularly in comparison with those of linear chain-like molecules, classic polymers. Limitations in synthesis approaches have delayed research on MIMs. Since the 1950's improved synthesis methods were sought to substantially increase the yield of MIMs. Recent advances in synthetic methods, particularly ""template-directed"" synthesis, have substantially improved yields for MIMs and led to the 2016 Nobel prize in Chemistry.

If viable unmodified circulating tumor cells can be separated from whole blood, then subsequent clinical analysis of these cells can lead to personalized cancer treatment. However, due to the extreme rarity of circulating tumor cells, a successful separation technology must meet the performance metrics of high-throughput, high-sensitivity, high-purity, and high-viability simultaneously to be useful - a goal that has never been achieved. To tackle these performance metrics, this project utilizes a novel threefold method called Three-Dimensional Deterministic Dielectrophoresis. Currently, the combined effects of three-dimensional geometry, deterministic lateral displacement and dielectrophoresis in a cell separation process represent a gap in research. Through this research, comprehensive understanding of the interplay between fluid mechanics, cell deformation, dielectrophoretic forces, and deterministic lateral displacement structures will be gained, which will lead to much improved sensitivity, purity, and cell viability at high-throughput - all requirements to be met at the same time. Additionally, the project will have a significant impact on a large number of underrepresented students in technical fields at both University of Illinois at Chicago (a federally designated Minority Serving Institution) and Washington State University Vancouver (a Research in Undergraduate Institutions eligible institution and the only four-year research university in southwest Washington). <br/><br/>The Three-Dimensional Deterministic Dielectrophoresis method brings a transformative impact by creating meaningful and valuable links between previously unconnected ideas and domain knowledge - namely deterministic lateral displacement, dielectrophoresis, and three-dimensional printing - potentially disrupting and outperforming all existing alternatives. However, in order to make the method truly useful for medical practice, fundamental knowledge about the separation process must be gained. This breaks down into three research objectives: 1) Study cell transport, cell-obstacle collision dynamics, and cell dielectrophoresis in periodic obstacle arrays using predictive models with experimental validations; 2) Fabricate Three-Dimensional Deterministic Dielectrophoresis devices and characterize how different obstacle shapes, geometries, obstacle array patterns, dielectrophoresis field parameters, carrier fluids and flow rates influence the cell separation performance; 3) Characterize circulating tumor cell separation performance for lung tumor cells against the four performance metrics above. This proposed research is significant because the multiphysics numerical models will elucidate scientific mechanisms of the complex separation principles of this method, which will guide experimental realization of a microfluidic device for high-throughput label-free circulating tumor cell separation. The research is unique in that dielectrophoresis will be combined with deterministic lateral displacement in a three-dimensional micro-structure for the first time, which is enabled by state-of-the-art nano three-dimensional printing technology. The research outcomes here have important implications for clinical applications including early cancer detection as well as diagnosis and prediction of cancer progression, as circulating tumor cells are increasingly recognized as predictive biomarkers in early stage cancer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an example, the developed computational methods will include an algorithm for rapidly finding the best possible simple approximation of a given function of many variables from just a few function evaluations.  If, e.g., the function one cares about is the probability of having an extreme rain event in Florida in two weeks as a function of current ocean temperatures, wind speeds, atmospheric pressures, etc. then such a method could help to provide a generic framework for quickly building up simple models to help predict such extreme rain events based on a reduced number of costly weather observations and climate simulations.  A second example of the numerical methods to be developed as part of this project include provably accurate methods for producing correct pictures of, e.g., microscopic material features from realistic ptychographic imaging data.  Such methods can help guarantee that the images one can obtain using well-planned ptychographic scans of microscopic object features (that are too small to see with the naked eye) actually look like the true object one scanned as opposed to, e.g., a distorted, fake, or even disguised version of the true object which just so happens to produce similar scan results.  <br/><br/><br/>More generally, this project will develop fast computational methods, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, for several problems that involve learning extremely large and high dimensional signals from severely underdetermined measurements. The developed numerical methods will include: (i) improved and generalized sublinear-time Sparse Fourier Transform (SFT) algorithms capable of rapidly approximating any function of many variables that exhibits sparsity in any given bounded orthonormal product basis, (ii) FFT-time and provably accurate lifted phase retrieval algorithms for approximately recovering compactly supported functions (up to a global phase factor) from their spectrogram measurements as well as new and even faster SFT-based compressive phase retrieval methods which run in only sublinear-time, and (iii) the development of new, fast, low-memory, and highly-parallel distributed density estimation algorithms for large multimodal datasets and tensors. A common difficulty in developing all three sets of algorithms for the problems above stems from the shear size of the memory and/or processing power required by their standard solution approaches, which limits both their applicability as well as one's ability to obtain fully determined sets of signal measurements for their use in many settings. In all three cases, new and computationally tractable algorithms will be developed that take advantage of hidden simplifying structure in each application above (e.g., generalized Fourier sparsity in the first case, intrinsically low rank data in the second case, and intrinsic low-dimensional geometric structure in the third) thereby providing numerical approaches capable of solving several types of large problems whose numerical solution currently lies beyond our collective capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematics behind origami, however, is not yet fully understood. In particular, some origami models can be folded and unfolded in such a way that we could make the crease lines be hinges and the paper between them stiff like sheet metal. Such models are called rigidly flexible origami and have applications that span the physical and biological sciences, ranging from unfolding solar sails to collapsible heart stents. This project will add mathematical tools that allow industrial applications to employ cutting-edge research, from large-scale architectural structures to nano-scale robotics driven by origami mechanics. The tools from this project will help design self-foldable structures. Currently self-folding designs in engineering, architecture, and the biological sciences involve building physical models in a trial-and-error approach, wasting time and resources. The self-folding research provided by this project will allow designers to avoid pitfalls and tighten the design-to-realization process significantly. In addition to the research component, the PI shall organize a diverse range of educational activities including in-service teacher training and education, undergraduate mentoring and preparation for graduate school; high-school and undergraduate classes on the mathematics of folding; for the public, general-audience articles, lectures, and exhibitions. This will increase interest in STEM fields through the fun, hands-on nature of origami while simultaneously disseminating project results.<br/><br/>The methods of this project involve a blend of practical experimentation with theory. Programmed self-foldability of structures will be achieved by trimming away undesired paths from the configuration space of all possible rigid foldings. One approach is to transform a given rigid folding of a crease pattern into a kinematically equivalent rigid folding with fewer degrees of freedom. The PI has proposed such a transform and will develop others. Key to all of this, however, is gaining a better understanding of rigid origami configuration spaces, which are algebraically complicated and not well understood. The project seeks to understand, and exploit, local-to-global behavior that is present in many known examples of rigid origami. In these examples approximating the configuration space near the origin (the unfolded state) leads to exact equations for the global configuration space. Formulating rigid origami configuration spaces in this way will add insight into the general field of flexible polyhedral surfaces, as well as provide the data needed to prove the feasibility of origami crease pattern transforms and design reliably self-foldable origami mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On a complex surface defined by algebraic equations, a cusp-like sharp point in an otherwise smooth region is called an isolated singularity. In nature, singularities occur when sudden changes or catastrophic events happen, thus the study of singularities from various viewpoints is important to all branches of science. In geometry, an object known as the link of singularity encircles the sharp point on the surface; this object resembles a sphere in the absence of a sharp point but typically has a complicated shape encoding properties of the singularity.  The PI will study the properties of such shapes and the additional structures they support. A particular focus will be on collections of planes called contact structures that arise in physics. Plamenevskaya's research will contribute to several areas of mathematics: low-dimensional topology, symplectic and contact topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.  Her other activities related to the project will make significant contributions to undergraduate education and graduate and postdoctoral training. Plamenevskaya is working to increase awareness of current research in topology among undergraduate students, as well as contribute to participation of women in mathematics. She co-organizes research seminars, conferences, and workshops for a diverse audience, from graduate students to distinguished researchers. <br/> <br/>Specifically, the PI will work with the canonical contact structure induced by the complex tangencies on the link of singularity. A particular goal of the project is to understand the relation between Stein fillings/cobordisms of such contact structures and smoothings/deformations of the surface singularity, and to address a variety of questions concerning the interplay of the singularity theory and symplectic and contact topology. The PI's previous work (with Ghiggini and Golla) shows that rational surface singularities with reduced fundametal cycle, whose deformation theory is well-understood, correspond precisely to the class of planar contact structures, whose fillings can be studied via surface diffeomorphisms. This opens the door to extending certain results from algebraic geometry to symplectic topology as well as to applications of symplectic topology to singularity theory.  Plamenevskaya will pursue these questions using a range of tools, including low-dimensional constructions such as open book decompositions and symplectic caps, complex and symplectic line arrangements, and certain Floer-homological and combinatorial invariants. She intends to discover further connections between the aforementioned constructions and ideas, which may additionally lead to new results on mapping class groups and combinatorics of line arrangements. Plamenevskaya will also study a number of related questions, such as certain constructions in lattice cohomology (a combinatorial theory introduced by Nemethi for links of singularities) and their relation to Heegaard Floer homology.

In many cases, imitation can rely on visual observations of an expert's actions, as when a child learns to use a spoon. Imitation with the voice, used when learning to produce the sounds of an unfamiliar language or when learning to sing a song, poses a different problem because one cannot see many of the movements that are involved. Indeed, many people find vocal imitation difficult. However, because the mechanisms underlying this ability are poorly understood, instructors have few resources with which to help such individuals.  The research program focuses on vocal imitation of pitch, a feature that is central to both music and speech production. The hypothesis guiding these experiments is that formation of a mental image of the to-be-achieved goal mediates and stimulates neural associations between auditory and motor networks that allow the actual production to be accurate. By contrast, a less skilled speaker or singer will not have formed as strong auditory-motor associations.<br/><br/>Three studies will examine participants imitating pitch patterns associated with song or speech. Spoken pitch samples will be based on English, where pitch is mostly used to convey emphasis, and Mandarin, where pitch is associated with word meanings. Participants in this research will include singers and non-singers, as well as individuals who speak Mandarin and those who do not. Planned studies will 1) assess basic cognitive processes (mental imagery, working memory, and perception) that contribute to imitation accuracy; 2) use electromyography to address whether auditory mental images are associated with sub-vocal muscle movements; and 3) explore the role that specific learning experience has on individuals' capacity to imitate. Results from these studies will be used to improve instruction for learning to speak a tone language and for singing. More effective instructional techniques could enhance the capacity and experience of those learning to speak and sing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Verification is a promising new technology for eliminating bugs from software. But verification is also very expensive--it may cost 10 times the amount of regular software development, making verification way too expensive to fully apply to all software. The project's novelties are based on making verification gradual, so that it can be applied to just part of a software system, not all of it.  The project's impacts are based on allowing engineers to focus verification efforts on the most important parts of applications, and on eliminating the bugs that cause the biggest problems.  This could eliminate the most severe bugs from software apps with a relatively small increase in cost. The project will also enhance the teaching of verification by providing students with a smoother path to learning the topic, and will take specific steps towards broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in computing. <br/><br/>The project's technical approach builds on recent work on abstracting gradual typing: a principled approach that that applies ideas from abstract interpretation to systematically adapt a static type system into one that allows static and dynamic types to be mixed. We proposed to adapt this approach to make verification gradual. In the gradual verification setting, developers can choose to specify possibly partial pre- and post-condition specifications for the critical functions in a program, while leaving other functions and properties unspecified.  The gradual verifier will use abstract interpretation to statically identify inconsistencies between specifications and code, but without triggering false warnings due to specifications that are missing or incomplete. It will also insert the minimum run-time checks that are necessary in order to enforce any properties that the static verifier cannot assure. The approach is being validated through a combination of formative qualitative studies, formalization and proof, prototype implementation and performance evaluation, and summative user studies and case studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simple algebraic transformations already  exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns may be revealed through the rigorous study of  moduli spaces, their compactifications and their stratifications  by dynamical invariants.  This project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and computational methods.  Its methods have already led to the discover of new and unexpected algebraic regimes, through a combination of theoretical tools that narrow the domain of search, and experimental methods such as the simulation of bouncing molecules in idealized chambers.<br/>A central issue in science, from biology to mathematics, is the study and classification of the wide variations that can take place in a single recognized species.   The moduli spaces  constructed by Ahlfors, Bers and Mumford in the 1960s, give this kind of classification for compact Riemann surfaces with a fixed genus g and number of marked points n. Today the study of moduli spaces is the meeting ground for disciplines ranging from arithmetic geometry to string theory. In dimension three, Riemann surfaces are replaced by hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This project aims to expand the frontiers of our understanding of both moduli spaces and hyerbolic 3-manifolds from the perspective of dynamical systems, unified by the action of SL2(R) in both regimes. It draws on methods ranging from complex analysis to low--dimensional topology and renormalization. The concerted study of specific examples, assisted by computer visualization and algebraic manipulation, also plays  a central role of in this research.<br/><br/><br/>The PI and his coworkers have recently discovered new totally geodesic curves and surfaces in the moduli spaces for (g,n) = (4,0), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,1). Their methods also reproduce most previously known examples of these rare and beautiful objects.  A central goal of this project is to put forth a unified construction of all known examples, and investigate the prospects for obtaining a complete classification. The project will also address problems concerning totally geodesic planes in open hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the complexity of closed loops on surfaces, the arithmetic underlying billiards in polygons, moduli spaces of rational maps, and connection between twisted 1-forms and 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. The training of graduate students to become active and independent researchers forms a central part of this project. The field of complex dynamics and moduli spaces is one where concrete  problems and examples abound, and yet some of the deepest insights and methods of modern mathematics can be brought to bear.

A year after the initial discovery, a group of researchers demonstrated that the high electric fields produced by a laser pulse converted the light passing through a quartz crystal from one color to another (red to green) via a nonlinear optical (NLO) process called second-harmonic generation. Since then, NLO materials like quartz have played a key role in advancing frontiers in laser science. NLO activity and other exciting properties are allowed in materials where inversion symmetry in broken, which are known as noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids. Through this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, Prof. Poeppelmeier's group at Northwestern University advances the understanding how chemistry can be used to create materials with broken inversion symmetry and connect atomic structure to properties. A variety of synthetic approaches are used to control the alignment of the building blocks that make up a crystal structure. Their growth of large, high-quality crystals of NCS materials enables detailed investigation of the connection between atomic structure and properties in NCS materials.

Emerging laser technologies require high-performance materials that can efficiently convert the frequency of laser radiation through nonlinear optical (NLO) processes, such as second-harmonic generation and parametric amplification. The NLO properties necessary for applications in tunable laser systems, as well as other technologically useful properties such as piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and pyroelectricity, are available in crystalline materials lacking inversion symmetry, known as noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids.

These synthetic efforts are guided by chemical knowledge as well as machine learning methods that elucidate important trends from large amounts of experimental data. The growth of large, high-quality crystals enables structural characterization with single crystal and powder x-ray diffraction along with NLO and other property measurements to determine structure-property relationships.

Studying other methods of solar geoengineering is essential for expanding the options available to society for addressing climate change. Studies of Marine Sky Brightening (MSB) have the potential to fundamentally alter discourse about solar geoengineering, as well as open up new avenues of research that have been heretofore under-studied. This project is focused on MSB.<br/><br/>Marine Sky Brightening (MSB) is a proposed method of solar geoengineering whereby sea salt particles are injected into the marine boundary layer. Like Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB), a related geoengineering technique, MSB would brighten clouds, increasing albedo and cooling the planet. However, preliminary modeling studies of MSB have shown that radiative forcing from direct scattering by the sea salt aerosols can be of a similar magnitude to radiative forcing from cloud brightening. Moreover, although MSB may be less efficient than MCB at exerting radiative forcing, it may not be as dependent upon local meteorological conditions: not all clouds can be brightened, and some areas that may be desirable to cool don't have clouds. This project includes a systematic exploration of MSB in a hierarchy of models, including radiative transfer models to understand optimal particle size for scattering, regional models and large eddy simulators to understand boundary layer dynamics and local climate effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Light is an electromagnetic wave and the electric field may interact with the charges present in the material to produce separation of the positive and negative charge centers resulting in the appearance of an electric field within the body of the material. When the intensity of the light is low, then the induced electric field is also very small and proportional (linear) to the applied field. However, when intense light such as that from a laser is used then it is possible that a very high (nonlinear) response may be obtained. This intense response to the externally applied electric field depends on the structure and composition of the material and can be used to generate light of a different color, or to modulate the propagation of light through the material via an intensity dependent refractive index. For example, it is highly desirable to be able to protect sensors and the naked human eye from high intensity light such as lasers. While the military implications of such materials are obvious, the benefits can affect many areas of everyday life. Most of the materials known to have a nonlinear response are cut from large crystals or are liquids and are not suitable to cover large areas reproducibly such as those needed for the application described before. In this project, the research team study a new class of nonlinear optical materials that are based on thin films that can be deposited reliably and reproducibly on large surface areas including complex geometries and even optical fibers with atomic scale precision. The project is training of two graduate students in an area of high technological importance.<br/> <br/>Technical description: Nonlinear materials in thin film form are highly desirable for on chip fast all-optical switching devices, frequency conversion and optical limiting applications as conventional nonlinear optical materials are not suitable for integration with the contemporary semiconductor industry process flow. This project seeks to address this shortage by designing and investigating novel nonlinear optical materials based on rational principles. The materials investigated are based on titanium and tantalum nitride seeded dielectric thin films where the at% of titanium-nitrogen or tantalum-nitrogen bonding in the film volume can be used to control the value of the nonlinear index of refraction and film transparency. The maturation of ALD as a thin film deposition technique allows the formation of such structures with atomic level thickness control, through a single deposition process by just controlling parameters such as the process temperature and the precursor delivery temperature. This project includes design of seeded materials with tunable composition, as well as the adaptation of optical techniques such as Z-scan and ultrafast pump-probe to investigate these novel, ultrathin structures. The proposed activity and the interdisciplinary research team seek to combine and transfer knowledge between the electronics materials and nonlinear optics communities. Such cross pollination is expected to advance the state of the art in both fields, with the goal to enrich the materials toolkit available for on chip fast all-optical switching, frequency conversion and optical limiting applications. The main outcome for this proposal is to provide detailed understanding of the physics governing a new class of semiconductor compatible nonlinear optical materials that may address the technological need for novel, well-characterized materials to aid in the realization of new device paradigms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting how changes in environmental conditions affect river processes, such as flooding and erosion, is critical for water resource management. This project uses knowledge of the past as a key to better inform the present through examining ~35 million year old sediments from an ancient river network in western Nebraska and South Dakota to quantify how changes in precipitation, vegetation and temperature in the past caused changes in river discharge and flood magnitude. These data, integrated with hydraulic models, will improve our ability to predict how rivers flood, sediment is transported and catchments evolve. Results of this work will have far reaching implications for understanding, modeling and planning for changes to river systems in the future. Three key broader impacts of this study include: 1) support of graduate and undergraduate students to develop interdisciplinary expertise; 2) sharing of data, methods and results as teaching data-sets on open-access platforms; 3) science outreach modules for children to explore 3-dimensional rock outcrops and animations from computational models. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to reconstruct the coevolution of paleoriver and ecosystems dynamics with environmental change in western North America during the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), perhaps the largest climate state change of the last 65 million years.

To achieve the project goals a team of geochemists, sedimentologists and hydraulic engineers will develop an integrated approach to understanding how rivers respond to environmental change.

Earth?s finite amount of water means that whenever one of these reservoirs fills, the others must empty to balance it. This simple principle - conservation of mass - has powerful implications for society's ability to understand past climate and sea-level change, and potentially for predicting these into the future. To understand the impacts of past changes in water and climate, the researchers ask a simple and fundamental set of questions: First, how did the global water balance respond to the climate of the last glacial period? Second, how did that response in turn impact the climate system through evaporation from the land, runoff into the ocean, and ecological change linked with the global distribution and function of wetlands? In this project the researchers will develop a new model that links these components of the hydrological cycle, and apply this to the recent geological past when vast ice sheets covered the high latitudes and lakes filled now-dry basins. By connecting this new model with geological data, the researchers hope to understand how changes in past sea level are distributed among ice sheets and water on the continents, including groundwater, lakes, and wetlands. They will also investigate how sudden freshwater release can impact ocean circulation and global climate. In parallel with this research, they will communicate the importance of water in the environment by sharing their digitally reconstructed ancient land- and water-scapes online, developing a watershed board game for educators, and contributing their findings to scientific journals and Wikipedia.<br/><br/>Terrestrial water storage plays a crucial role in climate, ecosystems, land-atmosphere interactions, and sea level. To date, most studies of the last deglaciation focus on changes in the ice sheets, but overlook the other components of the terrestrial hydrologic system: lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater, and permafrost. As a result the magnitude and pace of change of non-glacial terrestrial water storage - and its potential impact on the climate system - remains unknown. Here the researchers propose to reconstruct the global hydrologic environment during the last deglaciation. To do so, they will: (a) compile, integrate, and synthesize proxies for terrestrial paleohydrology since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM); (b) develop a coupled model linking glacial isostatic adjustment, lakes and rivers, and groundwater; and (c) integrate data and model to quantify the time evolution of global terrestrial hydrology. This output will allow them to quantify: (1) the migration, expansion, and contraction of surface water bodies; (2) the total amount of water stored on land and its impact on sea-level records and ice-sheet reconstructions; and (3) water inputs to the ocean through evapotranspiration and submarine groundwater discharge, alongside their potential to reconcile ice-sheet reconstructions with records of sea level and past ocean circulation. In conjunction with these research activities, the researchers will deliver their paleohydrologic reconstructions as maps available on Wikimedia Commons and Flyover Country, build instructional materials on past environments, and improve Wikipedia's coverage of hydrologic and paleoclimate science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such coatings are expected to find broad applicability in oil tankers, railcars, and trucks used to transport viscous fuels. The coatings will bring end-users considerable benefits in terms of reduced cleaning and repair costs while enabling improved energy efficiency and reducing the volume of fluids discarded during transportation. The technology is further of relevance to the design of nozzles for additive manufacturing, the processing of nuclear waste streams, and the robotic handling of specialty chemicals. In all of these applications, the coating will allow for viscous fluids to be delivered without adhesion and contamination of surfaces and with the added benefit of protecting the underlying substrate from corrosion. Benefits to society will include more efficient fuel utilization and reduced exposure of workers to potentially hazardous substances.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on research that has led to the development of thermally robust and highly textured coatings that readily glide both water and viscous oil droplets. Nature has an abundance of surfaces that are not wetted by water droplets (e.g., lotus leaves or shark skin); however, surfaces that are not wetted by low-surface-tension liquids, such as oils, do not exist in nature. This project is based on coatings that in laboratory tests are not wetted by either oil or water. The extreme non-wettability of these surfaces derives from the creation of thermally robust three-dimensional texturation spanning multiple length scales within ultra-thin metal or ceramic films, which gives rise to an interconnected network of trapped air pockets. Grafting molecules with intrinsically low wettability onto the surfaces of porous films yields extended surfaces that are non-wettable by water or oil.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With recent progress in biotechnology, animal cells are used to produce protein-based drugs and diagnostic antibodies. Also, stem cells are investigated as effective cures for degenerative diseases that are previously incurable. These applications require large-scale bioreactors with higher efficiency and reliability than currently available ones. The unique microstructure of RS provides very high surface-area to volume ratio and allows efficient flow of culture media through it, making RS ideal material for high-density adherent culture. Unlike conventional bioreactors, the bioreactor based on RS separates the cells from the culture media reservoir, allowing sufficient aeration of media and removal of cellular bio-waste without cellular damages. These improvements are expected to significantly reduce the production cost in biopharmaceutical industries and facilitate the introduction of exciting clinical applications of stem cells. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Suspension culture in stirred tank bioreactors are widely used to culture animal cells in large scale. However, harmful hydrodynamic shear stress and insufficient mass transfer rate of nutrients and gases limit efficiency and reliability of suspension culture in large scale. In this project, PI aims to develop novel RS bioreactors to overcome inherent limitations of suspension culture. RS is a thin polymer film with spacers that are rolled into a cylinder containing numerous identical microfluidic channels. Cells are growing in inner surfaces of RS and culture media flows through the microfluidic channels in a laminar flow. The RS can provide very large cell culture area and high mass transfer rate of nutrients and gases with minimal shear stress. In addition, separation of cells from media reservoir allows novel configurations of RS-based bioreactors. PI plans (1) to develop a mass-production setup of RS, (2) to develop a dialysis RS-bioreactor that can effectively remove cellular waste from the media for efficient production of therapeutic proteins, and (3) to implement a RS-bioreactor with low-temperature media storage that can extend lifetime of heat-sensitive signaling molecules in culture media for affordable stem cell production.

Traditional refrigeration and air-conditioning are based on the compression and expansion of an inert gas in a process that consumes a whopping 17% of the electrical energy consumed globally. In addition to being energy intensive, inevitable refrigerant leaks of the hydrochlorofluorocarbon gases (HCFs) are projected to contribute 13% of the global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Magnetic refrigeration is a process that relies on magnetic polarization within a solid material (not a gas) to absorb and release heat. While MR is theoretically capable of 50% more energy-efficient refrigeration than standard vapor-compression approaches, it is not widely adopted yet. This is due in part to an absence of materials that are simultaneously (1) high-performing in the temperature region of interest, (2) can be efficiently cycled with minimal energy losses, (3) are inexpensive, and (4) are based upon materials with high natural abundance. Some earth-abundant materials known to be active for MR but are not routinely used because of inefficiencies from cycling losses. As part of this project these materials are prepared as nanoparticles. Prof. Brock and her group at Wayne State University expect the decrease in the size of the particles to reduce barriers for magnetic polarization, thereby enabling efficient cycling. To evaluate this hypothesis, the researchers carry out tests on a series of structurally-related materials with different compositions as part of this project. In addition to providing key insights to the development of viable MR technologies, the project also includes training and mentoring of students in interdisciplinary collaborative research and introduction of Detroit-area 6th-9th grade students, many of which are minorities, to materials chemistry through hands-on activities for outreach events.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF this project establishes the fundamental characteristics of transition metal pnictide (pnicogen = Group 15 element) nanomaterials relevant to alternative energy applications, specifically focusing on magnetic refrigeration (MR). Many transition metal pnictide materials are well-suited to MR applications, displaying a large magnetocaloric effect (MCE, a large change in magnetic entropy during polarization and depolarization) near room temperature. The largest effects are associated with first-order (abrupt) phase transitions from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state at TC, but these are also quite sharp (do not span the temperature range of interest). Nanostructuring has been suggested as a means to broaden the temperature range over which MCE is maximized; blending particles with differing TC's to extend the temperature range over which appreciable magnetic entropy can be attained. In this project, ""materials opportunities"" in the search for functional magnetocalorics among nanoscale transition metal pnictides, are pursued via three aims. In Aim 1, magnetic entropy data is collected on P-doped MnAs nanoparticle samples and correlated to single particle magnetic force microscopy data to discern how polydispersity affects the ensemble behavior of the samples, in terms of producing uniform magnetic entropy responses over large temperature ranges. In Aim 2, a relative reactivity scale for metal precursors with P (trioctylphosphine), is created as a way to design new, more complex MCE materials (ternary and quaternary phosphide phases). Finally, in Aim 3 intrinsic challenges that face the exploitation of nanomaterials for magnetic refrigeration are addressed, including reduction of the magnetic entropy due to surface oxidation. Insights from the reduction strategy are leveraged to target new antimonide phase for MR. In addition to providing key insights to the development of viable MR technologies, the project also includes training and mentoring of students in interdisciplinary collaborative research and introduction of Detroit-area 6th-9th grade students, many of which are minorities, to materials chemistry through a hands-on activity based on liquid crystal sensors for the annual Wayne State University STEM day event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Policies and regulations governing data privacy play a critical role in communicating privacy expectations to users and defining the bounds of permissible data use. However, in practice, there are severe mismatches between user expectations and the actual practices of software companies, even when those practices conform with their privacy policies. This project's goal is to enable automated reasoning over privacy policies and regulations that can assist users, policy developers, and regulators in understanding unintended consequences of data practices and policies.<br/><br/>Past research on automated reasoning for privacy has led to efforts to formally model the logical semantics of regulations and support mechanized correctness proofs. The desire for transparency to users, on the other hand, has led to proposals for policy annotation schemes that support clearer presentation through natural language and visualization. This project aims to unify these goals by developing techniques to represent policies and regulations that are both formal and explorable, answering 'what if'? questions about specific scenarios in addition to providing provable guarantees.  The project requires technical advances in formal methods, narrative generation, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. The research team will formalize privacy regulations such as the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation, as well as privacy policies specific to software companies and service providers, using a relational programming model known as Answer Set Programming (ASP). The research team plans to discover new techniques for interoperating with ASP as a lightweight semantic modeling framework, with support for answering queries, generating scenarios that reveal privacy loopholes, generating counterexamples to global correctness conditions, suggesting repairs for broken policies, and enabling the exploration of hypothetical scenarios by policy developers and users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At 3.0 Ma, multiple species of Australopithecus are represented in the fossil record across eastern and southern Africa. By 2.5 Ma, Australopithecus mostly died out, and in its place evolved two separate lineages with very different adaptations to the environment. One lineage is our own, Homo, characterized by a pattern of increased brain size and dependence on material culture that has persisted over the last several million years. The other lineage, Paranthropus, lasted over 1 million years, and was represented by three species with unique dental and facial adaptations for potentially eating tough or hard foods. Despite the obvious importance of this interval, it is poorly represented in the fossil record and few fossil specimens have been found that can shed light on the causes and patterns of the origins of these lineages. The Ledi-Geraru Research Project works in a fossiliferous region that includes this important time interval and aims to illuminate the issues relevant to the extinction of Australopithecus and the emergence of Homo and Paranthropus. The investigators will use the results of this work in public science outreach about the hominin lineage, including the critical relationship between environmental variance and hominin adaptations. The project also will foster international collaborations and student training. <br/> <br/>In the last decade, the investigators have identified fossiliferous sediments in the Afar region of Ethiopia that range from 2.9 to 2.4 Ma before present. Finds from these sediments include a 2.8 million year old mandible that is the earliest known representative of the genus Homo, and additional fossils suggesting that there were multiple hominin species existing at roughly the same time in the region. In addition, several localities in the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area show evidence that hominins were using stone tools to gain access to animal tissues and resources. Continued paleoanthropological research will be conducted at Ledi-Geraru Project sites to recover additional fossil and archaeological materials and better understand relationships between hominin behaviors and environmental contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research objective is to create novel biomaterials with both imaging and therapeutic capabilities. Here, the PI will synthesize P2O5-CaO-Na2O phosphate sol-gel nanoparticles and will modulate the concentration of cations to control the structure-function properties including biodegradation time. One surprising feature of these materials is that they swell up to 500% larger during their biodegradation in aqueous environments. Thus, the PI hypothesizes that one can control this swelling by coating the nanoparticles with a responsive hydrophobic shell and use this size change to ablate cancer cells. By building the shell with site-selective cleavage sites, the nanoparticle core would be exposed to the cytosol and swell only in the presence of defined chemical cues. This swelling would then mechanically destroy the cells of interest. These materials also have an acoustic impedance mismatch with tissue and can report the cell killing process via ultrasound. The educational objective is to disseminate the research findings to the scientific community, graduate and undergraduate trainees, as well as high school students via focused seminars and hands-on training with a portable ultrasound scanner.

The PI will create very small particles of this phosphate-based biomaterial and use it to image and treat cancer. The remarkable feature of this biomaterial is that it swells when it degrades-size changes up to 5-fold were shown in preliminary data. This is useful because when these materials swell inside of cancer cells, they will destroy the dangerous tissue. This project will design the particles such that they only swell in the presence of biomarkers found on the surface of the cancer cells to prevent damage to other cells. A second important feature of this idea is that doctors can image the location of the particles with ultrasound. This is because sound waves will echo off the surface of the particles. Importantly, as the particles swell, even more sound waves will be reflected. Thus, doctors can use the images to understand the location of the particles and whether they have been activated by the cancer cells or not. The benefit to society will be a less traumatic and more effective cancer treatment, which includes an imaging signal physicians can use to customize treatment. These efforts will also educate the next generation of engineers and scientists using hands-on ultrasound modules in the teaching labs at UC San Diego.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The smallest crystals can be only a few nanometers in size, or about 100,000 times smaller than a sheet of paper.  These small crystals contain just a few thousand atoms. Some nanocrystals can concentrate light and the focused energy can be used in applications ranging from solar energy conversion to sensing.  However, a single type of nanocrystal can only concentrate a few colors of light. By changing its chemical composition, one can adjust this color for specific applications.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Delia Milliron at the University of Texas at Austin is growing nanocrystals that concentrate infrared light. While we cannot see infrared light, we feel it as heat from sunlight or a hot fire. Working with her students, Professor Milliron is studying how the size, shape, and composition of a nanocrystal influences its ability to concentrate infrared light. Their discoveries could lead to better ways of detecting specific chemicals and improved catalytic methods, which would have important benefits to society.

Most research on LSPR has focused on noble metals, which must be patterned into larger, micron-scale metal structures to reach mid-infrared frequencies. The limitations of that approach motivate the investigation of plasmonic metal oxide NCs. This is quantitatively establishing how NC physiochemical properties control the nature and strength of coupling between LSPR and vibrational modes, ultimately leading to the foundational understanding needed to develop sensitive and chemically specific detectors, and to direct the flow of energy to tune and enhance catalytic processes.

So, how do animals (sea urchins) that live in sea water protect themselves against infections?  Answers to this question apply to successful management of marine populations and productive aquaculture.  The sea urchin immune system lacks important aspects that are present in humans. For example, sea urchins do not produce antibodies. Instead, they express a family of anti-pathogen proteins called Transformer proteins (they change shape!).  At least one of the Transformer proteins acts very broadly, and can bind to bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens. This is very different from one antibody that binds only one target.  The hypothesis is that each Transformer protein has a slightly different repertoire of targets, which gives sea urchins great flexibility to protect themselves against pathogens with similar, different, or overlapping targets.  Because of the large variety of slightly different Transformer proteins, their complex anti-pathogen activities are likely essential for sea urchins to survive.  This project integrates research with education in the following manner. Artistic illustrations of science are effective for communicating science to the general public.  An Introductory Biology course will be designed and taught specifically for fine arts majors by faculty in Biology and the Arts.  Artist/scientist collaborations can improve whether people learn and understand important concepts in science, which will aid in science literacy.  Furthermore, improved science understanding by environmental policy students could have impacts on official government policy. <br/><br/>Sea urchins have a complex and robust anti-pathogen innate immune system comprised, in part, of SpTransformer (SpTrf; formerly Sp185/333) proteins.  The recombinant (r)SpTrf-E1 protein binds to Vibrio and yeast but not to Bacillus.  It binds LPS, beta-1,3-glucan, and flagellin, but not peptidoglycan.  rSpTrf-E1 is intrinsically disordered and transforms to alpha-helical in the presence of anionic targets such as PO4 groups.  The investigators predict that other versions of SpTrf proteins act similarly but recognize different but overlapping targets.  They will attempt to define the binding sites for rSpTrf-E1, define the targets bound by other rSpTrf proteins, determine whether other rSpTrf proteins undergo conformational transformation like (r)SpTrf-E1, and test the anti-pathogen activities of other SpTrf proteins in vitro and in vivo.  Outcomes are expected to clarify the binding and structural characteristics of the SpTrf proteins and their activities in host defense, providing a unique example of immunological adaptations by a basal deuterostome.  Art to illustrate science is an effective way for communicating science to the general public.  However, art students generally do not learn much in standard introductory science courses.  Hence, an Introductory Biology course will be designed and taught specifically for fine arts majors by faculty in Biology and the Arts.  The art inspiration will be the science learned from lectures, discussions, and contact with scientists.  Outcomes will highlight opportunities for artist/scientist collaborations such as improved data illustration, and for environmental science policy students to learn about important concepts in science, which may have impacts on official government policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Worldwide, UNICESCO estimates that 80% of wastewater is released untreated back into the environment resulting in harmful algal blooms, loss of freshwater ecosystems, and polluted drinking water sources. Even in high-income countries, roughly 30% of wastewater is released untreated. Not only are wastewater treatment solutions necessary for environmental and public health protection, they are fiscally sensible decisions, with investments in sanitation often yielding significant return to society. Municipal wastewater treatment facilities are often stressed by industrial discharge to sewers, and thus limit the pollutant loading by industries. In turn, industries are often stunted in growth by their wastewater production, which is especially a problem for smaller industries. The I-Corps work will initially focus on the pain points experienced by small industrial wastewater producers.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a low-cost bioreactor to meet the wastewater treatment needs of industry. The underlying technology relies on flow recirculation of wastewater through meshes on which treating and filtering biofilms (microorganisms) form. This new approach to an attached growth bioreactor, which pushes wastewater through the biofilms, eliminates the mass transfer limitation of diffusion of metabolites into the biofilm, as occurs in conventional attached growth systems. Because the meshes on which the biofilms form allow for some solids transport across them, they do not clog easily and allow for low-pressure filtration. Therefore, this new approach offers improved biological and effective physical treatment of wastewater. Sufficient solids and organics removal have been observed at the lab-scale under challenging operating conditions, anaerobic, low-temperature treatment of dilute wastewater, which indicates promise for better performance in less challenging conditions of higher temperature and higher strength wastewater, typical of many industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The variation of this field on the very longest wavelengths describes the elliptical shape of the Earth. This elliptical figure is important because it determines the location of the axis of rotation that passes through the Earth's center and also controls changes in inclination of the Earth relative to the sun, owing to the gravitational 'pull' from the moon, the sun, and other planets. The Earth, in effect, behaves as a spinning top that can oscillate and wobble in complex ways. These changes in axial rotation and inclination affect how much solar energy ('insolation') is received at different latitudes on Earth, especially in the polar regions, and therefore has a major impact on climate and how it changes over long time intervals. A major problem in geophysics is to determine how the elliptical form of the Earth is generated by forces deep inside our planet. These forces also drive the horizontal motions of Earth's tectonic plates and the geological 'drift' of continents, as well as vertically pushing and pulling the continents and oceans up and down over time. Despite more than thirty years of progress by geophysicists who map lateral changes in Earth structure deep inside our planet using seismic waves, and similar progress by computational geophysicists who use these maps to model the internal forces needed to explain the motions of tectonic plates and the 'bumps' in Earth's gravity field, there remains a difficulty in properly accounting for the flattening of the elliptical figure of the Earth that is seen by satellites. The principal investigators (PIs) in this proposal will directly tackle this outstanding challenge by using both earthquake and gravity data, and data describing the topography of the Earth and the movements of tectonic plates, to obtain new maps of Earth's internal structure and new determinations of the forces that can explain all these data simultaneously. The outcome of this work will allow the PIs to specifically tackle the current challenge of accounting for Earth's long-term elliptical figure, how it changes with time, and how it influences high-latitude insolation and hence climate over long times. Powerful computer resources will be deployed to carry out this study over the next three years, employing a collaborative team of researchers from the Universities of Texas and Florida. This work will provide opportunities for training new graduate students who will learn state-of-the-art techniques in computer modelling and will develop advanced expertise in the geophysical sciences. The results of this work will be shared with a broad community of scientists, students and the general public with web-based platforms, communications in conferences and workshop, and in outreach activities.<br/><br/>Key questions regarding the large-scale structure and dynamics of the mantle remain outstanding, despite three decades of progress in global seismic imaging of Earth's interior. There are longstanding difficulties in satisfactorily accounting for the very longest wavelength anomalies in Earth's gravity field, which are related to Earth's elliptical figure, with significant implications for Earth's time-dependent rotational dynamics. Questions concerning heterogeneity in the transition zone and the nature of ""large low shear velocity provinces"" (LLSVP) in the lower mantle, also continue to be elusive. These uncertainties regarding anomalous mantle structures directly impact our understanding of the global-scale dynamics of the Earth. To address the questions, the principal investigators propose a multidisciplinary effort to derive a new generation of tomography models that match a wide suite of surface data related to present-day structure and convective flow in the mantle, and can also constrain the time-dependent evolution of the mantle throughout the Cenozoic. To pursue these objectives the PIs will: (i) jointly invert global seismic and convection-related data with greatly improved coverage of 3-D mantle structure, incorporating geodynamic responses to lateral viscosity variations and topography on the discontinuities at the top and bottom of the transition zone; (ii) apply data assimilation methods to the new joint tomography models to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of 3-D mantle structure; (iii) calculate corresponding changes of Earth's moment of inertia, to be used in reconstructions of true polar wander and Milankovitch orbital cycles that are implicated in long-term climate variations. It is anticipated these new joint tomography models will provide improved constraints on the impact of transition-zone heterogeneity on convective mass and heat transport across this key region and on the spatial distribution of anomalous density structures within the LLSVP. This work will also contribute to resolving a longstanding difficulty concerning the origin of Earth's anomalous elliptical figure and the implications for the phase and amplitude of Milankovitch climate cycles in the geological past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our left and right hands are non-superimposable and are therefore chiral objects. Chirality exists throughout nature. The twist of a DNA helix gives it a specific handedness, determined by the twist direction. Light waves can be made to spiral as they travel through space. This special form of light -- called circularly polarized light -- has a specific handedness depending on whether the twist is clock-wise or counter clock-wise.  Circularly polarized light interacts more favorably with chiral objects when their handedness match. Chiral molecules therefore either absorb more left-handed or right-handed circularly polarized light. The difference is known as circular dichroism, which gives important insights into the handedness and geometry of molecules. However, the circular dichroism signal is usually weak.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry and Chemical Measurement and Imaging programs in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Stephan Link from Rice University is studying individual proteins placed in the gap between two metal nanoparticles, which concentrate the light and amplify the circular dichroism signal. Working with his students, Professor Link is applying advanced assembly methods to control the protein placement and using sophisticated spectroscopies to study the underlying enhancement mechanism, which is still poorly understood. Their discoveries could have far-reaching applicability to understanding neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In addition, the project incorporates concepts from multiple disciplines forming an attractive training platform for post-doctoral researchers, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. <br/><br/>To exploit defined nanoscale assembly and electric field manipulation for the detection of single chiral molecules and their structural dynamics, the Link lab is applying DNA origami methods for precise control over nanoscale geometry in combination with unique spectroscopic capabilities developed for determining the circular dichroism signals of single molecular-plasmonic complexes. Electromagnetic simulations and electron microscopy aid in the distinction between optical activity arising from the plasmonic nanostructure itself vs. the chiral molecule of interest. These studies are advancing the mechanistic understanding about plasmon-coupled circular dichroism and allow one to create substrates for sensing molecular structure of a single protein using circular dichroism. The project is also studying trochoidal dichroism using surface confined waves created by total internal reflection.  Trochoidal fields have electric components along the propagation direction of light and only exist at an interface. The Link lab is exploring which nanostructure and molecular geometries are sensitive specifically to trochoidal fields when the handedness of the cartwheeling motion of such fields is switched. Professor Link is also participating in Rice University's Civic Scientist Program, allowing him to educate K-12 students about nanotechnology and inspire them to pursue scientific careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heat released from the core drives slow convection of the hot mantle. This process results in the movement of tectonic plates, produces volcanism, and reshapes continents. Recent geophysical studies have suggested that the pattern of convection changes in the mid-mantle, from 800-1300 km depth. The upwelling plumes and subducting slabs which dominate mantle convection appear in seismic tomography images to become deflected in the mid-mantle. It is unknown whether this is due to composition or viscosity.  The upper mantle is known to have similar seismic discontinuities that are thought to be caused by variations in chemistry or mineral phase changes as the mantle gets hotter and pressure increases with depth.  The goal of this research is to use new methods to understand the large reflectors in the mid-mantle by developing comprehensive maps of the small-scale seismic properties, and comparing them to characteristic signatures for different types of geodynamic flow domains, such as known slab or upwelling regions.   This project will support both graduate and undergraduate student research.  The project will foster new international collaborations between New Mexico State University, a Hispanic-serving institution, and universities in Europe and Australia. The work will benefit various other disciplines across the wider Earth Sciences community, and promote Geophysics to minority students in New Mexico.  This project is jointly funded by the Geophysics Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>This project will determine the varied origins of mid-mantle seismic reflectors, ascertain their spatial relationship to flow patterns in the mantle, such as downwelling cold slabs or upwelling plumes, and investigate potential formative processes and compositional origins. The work will generate comprehensive regional-scale seismic maps of reflectors from 800-1300 km depth in the mantle. Novel and established analytical methods will be applied to compile and evaluate complementary datasets (SS and PP precursors; ScS and PcP reverberations; receiver functions), to constrain reflector geometry, apparent impedance contrast, sharpness, and heterogeneity across multiple length-scales of lateral resolution (100-1,000 km). These observables will be tested and linked via forward modelling of synthetic seismograms. Results will be analyzed in the context of global seismic tomography and geodynamical models, using seismic velocity as a proxy for geodynamical flow. This research will establish the characteristic signatures of mid-mantle reflectors for several well-sampled velocity domains representative of diverse geodynamical settings, incorporating statistical correlations and clustering analysis. Reflector properties from each domain type will be assessed within the framework of global geodynamical numerical simulations, and testing against the influence of different scenarios of convection history. Subsequently, this will inform regarding likely formative mechanisms and thermochemical origins for the reflectors. Synthetic seismic data generated from different geodynamical models will provide a direct comparison to seismic observations. This multidisciplinary approach will inform regarding the influence of seismic transitions on mantle convection and vice versa and elucidate the role of flow for generating physical structures. The project will help to map the seismic signatures of global mid-mantle circulation, characterize thermochemical exchange between lower and upper mantle, and provide insight into the history and style of mantle mixing and dynamics. The results will provide valuable inputs for the next generation of geodynamical simulations and mineral physics studies in the mantle, and have wide implications ranging from the mapping of primordial unmixed mantle reservoirs, to tracing the deep origins of continental volcanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The entire research field of optoelectronics is concerned with explaining the quantum interaction of light with electronic material components, increasingly on the scale of atoms and molecules. For many semiconductors, intense laser light can excite electrons, which then leave oppositely-charged shadows behind, known as ""holes"".  These electrons and holes behave as a plasma (a gas of charged particles) confined within the solid. Solving the complicated equations describing such plasmas in three-dimensional space can be prohibitive, even on today's supercomputers. Quantum-wires, however, have a thickness over 1000 times smaller than a human hair, and they allow us to test quantum plasma models on charges that are confined to only one dimension in space. This project aims to calculate the evolution of electron-hole plasmas in interacting quantum wires, as well as the evolution of the light that excites them. The goal is to improve knowledge of optical and transport properties of light-generated plasmas on time-scales of a millionth of a billionth of a second. This knowledge is important for understanding of light-matter interactions, as well as advancements in nano-optoelectronics, sensing, and many national security applications. This project also has significant broader impacts in providing undergraduate students a chance to participate in cutting-edge research, development of new college course curricula based on the research results, and enabling public outreach.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the goal of this project is to develop improved calculations of the ultrafast dynamics of photo-excited electron-hole plasmas in quantum wires, as well as the scattering of ultrashort laser pulses incident on a quantum wire array.  The computations will couple Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain (PSTD) techniques of modeling light propagation to quantum-kinetic Semiconductor Bloch equations for the many-body plasma dynamics in the quantum wires. This project advances our knowledge of plasma dynamics in solids by dispensing with several common assumptions often used to simplify such calculations; including monochromatic laser fields, electron-hole distributions in quasi-equilibrium, spatially uniform electric fields in the medium, and neglect of longitudinal fields resulting from the spatial electron-hole plasma distribution.  These assumptions are a limiting factor on today's optoelectronic calculations involving intense light, particularly on the nanometer length and femtosecond time scales.  The project will seek to find experimentally measurable indicators of the correlation between the localized response of quantum-wire plasmas and the spatial-temporal features and phases of the scattered light pulses. It will also look for a measurable correlation between the current from driven electron-hole plasmas, as well as localized longitudinal electromagnetic fields due to induced, long-lasting plasma oscillations in the quantum wires. The results of the project will also be important for advancements in the emerging fields of femtosecond electronics and attosecond physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At 3.0 Ma, multiple species of Australopithecus are represented in the fossil record across eastern and southern Africa. By 2.5 Ma, Australopithecus mostly died out, and in its place evolved two separate lineages with very different adaptations to the environment. One lineage is our own, Homo, characterized by a pattern of increased brain size and dependence on material culture that has persisted over the last several million years. The other lineage, Paranthropus, lasted over 1 million years, and was represented by three species with unique dental and facial adaptations for potentially eating tough or hard foods. Despite the obvious importance of this interval, it is poorly represented in the fossil record and few fossil specimens have been found that can shed light on the causes and patterns of the origins of these lineages. The Ledi-Geraru Research Project works in a fossiliferous region that includes this important time interval and aims to illuminate the issues relevant to the extinction of Australopithecus and the emergence of Homo and Paranthropus.

The variation of this field on the very longest wavelengths describes the elliptical shape of the Earth. This elliptical figure is important because it determines the location of the axis of rotation that passes through the Earth's center and also controls changes in inclination of the Earth relative to the sun, owing to the gravitational 'pull' from the moon, the sun, and other planets. The Earth, in effect, behaves as a spinning top that can oscillate and wobble in complex ways. These changes in axial rotation and inclination affect how much solar energy ('insolation') is received at different latitudes on Earth, especially in the polar regions, and therefore has a major impact on climate and how it changes over long time intervals. A major problem in geophysics is to determine how the elliptical form of the Earth is generated by forces deep inside our planet. These forces also drive the horizontal motions of Earth's tectonic plates and the geological 'drift' of continents, as well as vertically pushing and pulling the continents and oceans up and down over time. Despite more than thirty years of progress by geophysicists who map lateral changes in Earth structure deep inside our planet using seismic waves, and similar progress by computational geophysicists who use these maps to model the internal forces needed to explain the motions of tectonic plates and the 'bumps' in Earth's gravity field, there remains a difficulty in properly accounting for the flattening of the elliptical figure of the Earth that is seen by satellites. The principal investigators (PIs) in this proposal will directly tackle this outstanding challenge by using both earthquake and gravity data, and data describing the topography of the Earth and the movements of tectonic plates, to obtain new maps of Earth's internal structure and new determinations of the forces that can explain all these data simultaneously. The outcome of this work will allow the PIs to specifically tackle the current challenge of accounting for Earth's long-term elliptical figure, how it changes with time, and how it influences high-latitude insolation and hence climate over long times. Powerful computer resources will be deployed to carry out this study over the next three years, employing a collaborative team of researchers from the Universities of Texas and Florida. This work will provide opportunities for training new graduate students who will learn state-of-the-art techniques in computer modelling and will develop advanced expertise in the geophysical sciences. The results of this work will be shared with a broad community of scientists, students and the general public with web-based platforms, communications in conferences and workshop, and in outreach activities.<br/><br/>Key questions regarding the large-scale structure and dynamics of the mantle remain outstanding, despite three decades of progress in global seismic imaging of Earth's interior. There are longstanding difficulties in satisfactorily accounting for the very longest wavelength anomalies in Earth's gravity field, which are related to Earth's elliptical figure, with significant implications for Earth's time-dependent rotational dynamics. Questions concerning heterogeneity in the transition zone and the nature of ""large low shear velocity provinces"" (LLSVP) in the lower mantle, also continue to be elusive. These uncertainties regarding anomalous mantle structures directly impact our understanding of the global-scale dynamics of the Earth. To address the questions, the principal investigators propose a multidisciplinary effort to derive a new generation of tomography models that match a wide suite of surface data related to present-day structure and convective flow in the mantle, and can also constrain the time-dependent evolution of the mantle throughout the Cenozoic. To pursue these objectives the PIs will: (i) jointly invert global seismic and convection-related data with greatly improved coverage of 3-D mantle structure, incorporating geodynamic responses to lateral viscosity variations and topography on the discontinuities at the top and bottom of the transition zone; (ii) apply data assimilation methods to the new joint tomography models to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of 3-D mantle structure; (iii) calculate corresponding changes of Earth's moment of inertia, to be used in reconstructions of true polar wander and Milankovitch orbital cycles that are implicated in long-term climate variations. It is anticipated these new joint tomography models will provide improved constraints on the impact of transition-zone heterogeneity on convective mass and heat transport across this key region and on the spatial distribution of anomalous density structures within the LLSVP. This work will also contribute to resolving a longstanding difficulty concerning the origin of Earth's anomalous elliptical figure and the implications for the phase and amplitude of Milankovitch climate cycles in the geological past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data are highly valuable for studying diverse developmental pathways such as leaf, root and seed development, as well as the formation and function of root nodules, specialized plant structures that fix atmospheric nitrogen. The datasets will also lead to the identification of critical DNA sequences that control gene expression and will allow their more accurate characterization as well as lead to engineering of these sequences for crop improvement. The datasets and genomic resources generated here will be released publicly and immediately following quality control through an interactive website and federal data repositories. In addition to the scientific and agricultural impact, the project continues a partnership with primarily Hispanic and Native American tribal colleges in the Southwest. A workshop that presents modern-day computational biology approaches to explore DNA sequences will be hosted at Santa Fe Community College. This event serves as a conduit to engage the public and interested undergraduates in research activities and also serves as a means to recruit interns and their faculty mentors for summer training at our research institutions annually. <br/><br/>Significant progress has been made in recent years in plant genome assembly and gene annotation. However, the systematic identification and functional characterization of plant cis-regulatory DNA elements remain a challenge, as methods that are highly effective in animals have not translated to plants. A comprehensive and well-curated data set of plant cis-regulatory DNA elements is instrumental to understanding transcriptional regulation during development and/or in response to external stimuli. In addition, cis-regulatory DNA elements are hotspots for genetic variations underlying agronomically and evolutionarily important traits. The research team has recently optimized several high-throughput methods to identify cis-regulatory elements by chromatin signatures, their bound transcription factors, their target genes by direct physical chromatin interactions, and their regulatory activities in high-throughput reporter assays. The goal of this project is to use these methods to systematically identify, analyze and functionally validate cis-regulatory elements in important legume species including Glycine max (soybean), Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean), Phaseolus coccineus (runner bean), Arachis ipaensis, Arachis duranensis and Arachis hypogea (peanut).

Missed strokes in the emergency setting can result in patients suffering from increased long-term disability and cost the healthcare systems millions of dollars in medical expenses and lost productivity. By using artificial intelligence and mobile devices to bring the experience and knowledge of vascular neurologists closer to the patient at the time of their stroke, this technology can help reduce the number of strokes missed. In particular, rural and low population density areas can benefit from increased access to expert neurological knowledge that may not be readily or reliably accessible in their communities. Additionally, the increasingly aging population is at an overall higher risk for stroke further increasing the demand and potential impact of this technology in preventing the long-term consequences of stroke on patients and the healthcare system. The underlying technology can also be expanded to include assessment of other neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis, headaches and Parkinson's disease thereby opening up new market opportunities in the the diagnosis and monitoring of these conditions.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on technology that combines knowledge from the fields of neurology and computer science to create a set of algorithms that will accurately assess patients for signs of stroke. The algorithms use computer vision techniques to analyze videos of patients undergoing a stroke assessment. Machine learning classification techniques are then used to decide if the video is likely showing a positive or negative stroke assessment. The algorithms are trained and tested with data validated by vascular neurologists thereby learning directly from human experts. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated for algorithms detecting individual signs of stroke but development of a comprehensive stroke assessment algorithm is underway. Further development of the technology for specific applications requires a thorough understanding of customer and key stakeholder needs and will be focus of this I-Corps Team project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This pattern occurs because larger individuals are better at retaining heat in cold environments, but worse at dissipating heat in warm environments. This idea predicts that organisms will get smaller in response to rising temperatures. Although many organisms fit this pattern, the underlying physiology and contribution of genetic changes or environmental conditions is poorly understood. The research will examine the role hormones play in rapidly changing body size in house sparrows. As part of these studies, breeding nest-box populations of house sparrows will be established at two tribal colleges and three additional sites along a latitudinal gradient. An important goal of the study is to provide Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) opportunities for American Indian students at tribal colleges. Students that participate in REUs experience numerous benefits including increased problem solving skills and enhanced retention in STEM disciplines. However, typical REUs require undergraduates to relocate for extended periods of time, which often conflicts with other family and community commitments. The study seeks to overcome this barrier by creating local REU opportunities at tribal colleges, which will be assessed to inform future educators interested in using similar approaches. In addition, house sparrows will be re-sampled at sites throughout the U.S. and a tissue bank will be created and both historical and contemporary datasets will be published to serve as a permanent benchmark for future studies. <br/><br/>Hormonal mechanisms commonly influence suites of traits and are expected to play an important role in shaping life-history strategies in response to environmental change. The research will test the hypothesis that variation in the insulin/insulin-like signaling hormonal network is a mechanism that mediates rapid shifts in body size along a latitudinal gradient in house sparrows using a combination of historical and newly collected data and samples, a reciprocal transplant experiment, a hormonal manipulation, and transcriptomics. The research will greatly extend what is known about the role of hormonal mechanisms in mediating rapid phenotypic variation in life history traits. Knowledge of how micro-evolutionary and plastic responses contribute to variation in hormonally mediated life history strategies is essential for predicting long-term evolutionary responses to environmental change. If among population variation in hormonally mediated traits is primarily due to micro-evolutionary changes in hormone levels, this is expected to facilitate the rapid evolution of a suite of traits sensitive to the ligand, but to simultaneously limit the independent evolution of these traits. Alternatively, if population level variation is primarily due to micro-evolutionary changes in trait specific receptor densities, traits may evolve independently. If instead, most of the variation is due to developmental plasticity, long-term responses are expected to be more limited. This integrative study spans levels of analyses from gene expression to population level variation in life-history traits and in doing so will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie a long standing ecological pattern.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core in a CDot is made of carbon, and the coating on the surface is composed of nontoxic organic or biological molecules. CDots have recently been demonstrated to have highly effective antibacterial function under visible/natural light, which is associated with their unique optical properties and photoinduced redox characteristics. Building upon the known antibacterial function of CDots, this project expands the research and development of CDots to target viruses. Viruses have different structures, and replicate in a different way from bacteria, so specifically designed and modified CDots and hybrid dots with the core composed of carbon and other materials are synthesized and tested to identify those that are most effective to target viruses. The successful execution of this project could lead to the development of effective antiviral agents with potential applications for preventing viral transmission and infection, addressing some of the critical issues in public health and safety. The project also provides excellent opportunities for the research development of faculty, the training of underrepresented minority students, and the recruitment of students into the pipeline to STEM programs at North Carolina Central University.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/>This project is to develop carbon dots (CDots) and novel carbon-based hybrid dots to target viruses. The hybrid dots, with TiO2 doping or dye photosensitizer encapsulation in core carbon nanoparticles, are designed to significantly improve the optical properties and enhance photodynamic effects, thus exploiting the synergistic effect of the two constituents within the hybrid dots for more effective antiviral activities. With the use of two structurally different model viruses, murine norovirus (MNV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the project has three research aims: 1) Evaluation of the antiviral activities of selected CDots platforms against representative viruses, towards the understanding of property-function correlations by using various viral binding assays and infectivity assays. 2) Exploration of selected hybrid dots  (C/TiO2 and C/dye photosensitizer hybrid dots) for more effective antiviral activities against MNV and VSV, including a systematic evaluation on the correlation between major CDots properties such as dot surface charge, dot size, and optical properties and their antiviral effectiveness. 3) Mechanistic exploration of CDots and hybrid dots' antiviral actions, focusing on the interactions between the dots and viruses, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, viral particle integrity, and damages in viral proteins and viral genomic integrity by using various chemical/biochemical analytic tools and high-resolution microscopy methods.

The project will explore new methods for creating high-intensity helical laser pulses and new methods that facilitate the exchange of OAM between a laser pulse and a plasma.  Specifically, the aim is to determine the impact of the OAM exchange on laser-driven ion acceleration via computational modeling, and to experimentally test the results of the models at the ELI facilities.  This exploratory research will pave the way towards a long term research program of utilizing helical light beams for novel nuclear physics and strong-field experiments at the ELI-Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) facility in Romania.<br/><br/>In the context of high-intensity laser-matter interactions, most of the laser improvements have been focused on increasing power, on-target intensity, total energy, and the contrast of the compressed pulse. There is however another fundamental characteristic of polarized light - its angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum is associated with an azimuthal phase dependence, so it is independent of the polarization and can be significantly enhanced by generating a laser beam with twisted wave-fronts. This project is a collaborative program with an aim to explore the frontiers of light-matter interaction by pushing the OAM carrying helical photon beams to relativistic intensities and investigating their exchange of angular momentum with relativistic plasmas. This project will combine theoretical and simulation research with a dedicated experimental program at the new 1 petawatt (PW) CETAL laser and 1 PW and 10 PW ELI-NP laser facilities in Romania. The project will determine the impact of the OAM exchange on laser-driven ion acceleration and the conditions for effectively generating a twisted pondermotive force by short laser pulses. The latter generates a long-lasting volumetric magnetic field in a plasma suitable for controlling charged particle transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Analysis of PDE is an area of Mathematics that is central to the development of Natural Sciences. Indeed, PDE are used in the modeling of many phenomena, like the atomic properties of matter, the dynamics of celestial bodies, the mechanics of fluids and gases (used for example in weather forecast), and the study of electromagnetic phenomena (fundamental to modern communications).  This variety of applications is reflected in the complexity of a field rich in open problems and fruitful research directions. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in Analysis is thus crucial to the scientific and economic competitiveness of the US, and so is any effort to attract students to the area. At the same time, leading students to achieve a view of the subject that is not merely technical and overly specialized, but also succeeds in emphasizing the versatility and depth of the field, requires the coordinated work of a group.<br/><br/>The five co-PIs (Israel, Maggi, Patrizi, Pavlovic, Vasseur), together with the larger group of PDE experts at UT Austin (including Beckner, Caffarelli, Chen, Gamba and Ren), are strongly committed to research training, with a combined research activity that covers a vast area of interconnected topics in PDE, and has received international recognition. This project will include 5 postdoctoral fellowships and 20 annual graduate fellowships, thus increasing the number of US citizens trained in the Analysis of PDE at UT Austin; and a comprehensive series of actions aimed at increasing the visibility of our activities among undergraduate students, both internally and externally to UT Austin, and with particular emphasis on students from universities in Central Texas serving large minority populations. The educational activities of the group (seminars, courses, informal lectures, reading courses, etc.) will be carefully revisited and enhanced, to expose trainees to new ideas, and to multiply the opportunities for mentoring, teaching, professional development, and interactions at all levels. An annual Summer Program and a professionally designed and maintained website will increase the national visibility of our program and help dispersing its most successful practices. The ultimate expected outcome is creating positive lasting changes in the research training culture at our department and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Silicones are important to society as they are typically heat-resistant polymers used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation.  Silicones are currently industrially made using platinum which is expensive, rare and environmentally-damaging to mine.  This research is focusing on replacing platinum with other more Earth-abundant and sustainable metals.  Dr. Zhang has designed new families of catalysts using metals such as manganese, vanadium, and aluminum. Catalysts based on these inexpensive metals have traditionally been ignored because they are usually unreactive and unstable. Dr. Zhang is addressing these gaps using group attached to the metal that enhance the reactivity of these metals. This project also provides hands-on training for undergraduate students in both organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.  Experience with modern instrumentation is gained by these students.  John Jay College, which has a large Hispanic student population, is an ideal setting to train students who are underrepresented in scientific fields. <br/><br/>Dr. Zhang aims to investigate the synthesis, structures and catalytic properties of base metal complexes supported by redox active terpyridine ligands, as well as their catalytic properties relevant to silicone preparation. Novel catalysts composed of Earth-abundant metals including manganese, vanadium and aluminum and terpyridine-type ligands are being explored for their unique structures and catalytic reactivity in reduction processes. Their applications in catalytic hydrofunctionalization reactions are sought to develop effective catalysts to replace platinum-based catalysts that are widely used in industrial silicone production. Mechanistic studies are being carried out based on a combined experimental and theoretical effort, in order to understand the importance of ligand compartment and to establish the structure-activity relationships.

Carbohydrates are involved in many biological functions including: tissue development, intracellular signaling, immune responses, cell-cell communication, cancer, metabolic disorders and pathogen infection. Understanding how carbohydrates are made and how they react adds to fundamental knowledge in cellular and molecular biology and provides insight across a variety of fields. In this context, there is a growing demand to make specific and diverse glycomimetics and to study their reactivities.  While gycomimetics are desirable synthetic products, their structures are difficult to make because of their complexity. To this end, this research is developing robust methods for the synthesis of glycomimetics. This program links real-life problems in biology to chemistry solutions, thereby drawing students to the physical sciences and providing broad-based training for STEM careers. Professor Mootoo leverages potential applications to human health, the diverse 20,000-student body of Hunter College, and the unique cultural environment in New York City, to attract underrepresented high school and undergraduate students to STEM fields and the scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The synthetic chemistry under investigation centers on the reactions of carbohydrate-derived crotylating agents with aldehydes and imines. While crotylating reagents are widely used in organic synthesis, carbohydrate variants have not been as extensively explored because of the high intrinsic reactivity of crotylating agents and the complexity and nuanced chemistry of carbohydrates. These issues are being mitigated by recent advances in organic synthesis and the expertise of Professor Mootoo in carbohydrate chemistry. A toolbox of tin, boron and silicon based reagents is being assembled and used to synthesize mimetics of biologically active glycosphingolipids and complex oligo-mannosides. The broader scientific impacts of this research include a better understanding of the immunological properties and anti-viral activities of these materials, including their role in communicable diseases. Given the often idiosyncratic reactivity of carbohydrates, this project is also unveiling unique reactivity profiles that can inform innovative paradigms for complex molecule synthesis. Finally, the research also provides excellent training for the graduate students and undergraduates that will work on this project alongside Professor Mootoo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of this energy is used to overcome drag forces produced by the turbulent flow of gases and liquids; only a modest reduction in drag would result in large fuel savings.  Drag is associated with turbulent flow creating regions of concentrated vorticity near walls.  Previous methods for reducing the drag forces, such as introducing substances (such as polymers) into the flow, did not exploit the known structure of the turbulence in a targeted way. When polymers are injected or bled into the near-wall turbulent boundary layer, they become distributed randomly, making it impractical in most cases to use these additives to reduce drag.   This work seeks to answer: Can micro-particles containing a suitable additive and having specific physical properties be introduced into turbulent flow to achieve much greater drag reduction than traditional methods? The success of the present approach in reducing drag is expected to motivate the emergence of technologies focused on the development of micro-particles that can detect the nature of their own flow environment and respond by modifying that environment. For example, particles which segregate themselves into turbulent structures based on their density and subsequently dissolve will be examined first, but future smart particles might sense local flow properties, such as flow stain rates, and subsequently direct themselves to regions of the flow where their effects may be most impactful. It is easy to imagine how reducing drag on ships, cars, trains, and airplanes would have a broad impact on society.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed work aims to specifically target these structures by allowing particles, smaller than the smallest turbulent length scale and of the appropriate shape or density, to carry and release drag reducing agents as they collect in a natural way within or around such structures. Ideally, as one such structure is disrupted, remaining particles will migrate to the next in a disruptive cascade. Particle properties (especially particle sizes, densities, polymer properties, polymer release mechanisms, particle injection locations, and injection rates) and smart injection techniques that are most effective in reducing drag will be determined. It is proposed to study this concept using direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (which describe fluid motion) for the transitional case of turbulent spot evolution and for the fully turbulent flat plate boundary layer and channel flow cases. These situations cover the canonical transitional and turbulence internal and external flow regimes relevant to flow about ships as well as within pipelines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet over the eons, tremendous insect pressure on plants has led to the evolution of a remarkable diversity of tactics to defend against being consumed. Plants defend with toxins, spines, and sticky sap. Despite demonstrations of how plant traits can reduce herbivory, in most wild plant systems scientists lack an understanding of the mechanisms of plant defensive responses. Do plants make specific toxins targeted at root feeders versus leaf feeders, all the while not poisoning beneficial visitors such as pollinators?  Deciphering the mechanisms of plant defense not only advances scientific knowledge of ecology and evolution but may have important societal benefits. Because wild plants have been engaged in a long-term evolutionary battle with insect pests, studying the mechanisms of defense may enhance crop pest management. This project focuses on milkweeds, which are the only host for the declining monarch butterfly.  Basic knowledge of the interaction between monarchs and milkweed will be gained, which could help sustain the monarch's threatened migration.  This project blends the latest advances in genomic manipulation, toxicology and chemistry in a way that will train scientists to meld natural history and important ecological problems.  The investigators will expand their communication to the public through schools, presentations, and a blog.<br/><br/>Little is known about how plant defenses are aimed at different attackers, whether there are trade-offs associated with multiple arms races, and whether tissue-specific phenotypic plasticity is a means to manage interactions with several pests. This work uses milkweeds as a model natural system with well-characterized defense chemistry to test the specificity and interdependence of interactions with diverse insect attackers that include leaf-feeding monarch butterflies, root-feeding beetles, and seed-feeding bugs. From the plant's perspective, trade-offs will be evaluated between multiple defenses and their non-target impacts on pollinating bumblebees as costs associated with constitutive or induced defenses. From the herbivores' perspective, assays of plant toxin expression will be coupled to impacts on insect target site enzymatic function, behavior, and whole-organism performance. Beyond guild-specific plant defense and trade-off hypotheses, classic explanations for diversity in plant defense will also be tested: the non-exclusive hypotheses that (i) naturally occurring toxin mixtures are differentially expressed in plant parts and (ii) mixtures are more effective than equal doses of single compounds. This view on specialization and interaction addresses the dynamic match in offense-defense traits that may generate diversity within plants and insects through distinct arms races occurring from roots to fruits. Feeding trials will be used to address how single cardenolides and natural mixtures impact physiological function, insect behavior, sequestration, and fitness. By extracting the Na/K-ATPase (the target of cardenolides) from the different insects, the specific action of toxins will also be assessed in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these habitats have experienced widespread loss and fragmentation due to human activities. This loss threatens the services these ecosystems provide to humans as well as the extraordinary biodiversity of fishes and invertebrates that live within them. However, there is still a lot that is unknown about these habitats which makes it difficult to understand the likely impacts of habitat loss or the benefits of habitat restoration. This research focuses on habitat loss and fragmentation in coral reef ecosystems. The focus of the research is to understand how habitat loss and fragmentation affects the biodiversity of fish and crustaceans on coral reefs in the South Pacific. Because many creatures living within the coral offer important benefits to the coral such as defense from coral predators and removal of sedimentation, this research also seeks to better understand how changes in the biodiversity and abundance of fish and invertebrates associated with corals, affect the capacity of corals to withstand future impacts, such as sedimentation and outbreaks of coral-eating seastars. Understanding whether habitat loss alters the capacity of corals to withstand stress in an increasingly stressful world is critical to devise effective strategies to manage and protect coral reefs and the many services they provide to society. <br/><br/>Many marine systems are characterized by habitat-forming foundation species, which harbor a diversity of occupants, and whose dynamics are thought to drive resilience of entire ecosystems As a result, there is widespread concern over the ongoing loss and fragmentation of biogenic habitats such as seagrass beds, oyster reefs, kelp forests, and coral reefs. Yet, without a more complete understanding of marine landscape ecology, we struggle to predict how the degradation or restoration of habitat will alter ecosystem dynamics, function, and resilience. Most research in marine landscape ecology has focused on spatial patterns of occupant abundance and biodiversity; however, the causes and consequences of these patterns are rarely explored. An important but understudied consequence of variation in occupant density is that it may alter how occupants interact with their biogenic habitat. Because occupants can benefit biogenic habitat or harm biogenic habitat, changes in occupant density can affect habitat growth and survival. Consequently, habitat-driven variation in occupant density should feed back to alter habitat dynamics and the spatial patterning of the habitat. In summary, we are limited in our understanding of why patterns in landscape ecology exist, how these patterns alter the population dynamics and spatial patterns of the occupants as well as their habitat, and what the implications of habitat degradation or restoration will be. The central objective of this proposal is to examine the causes and consequences of the nonlinear relationship between occupant abundance and the amount of biogenic habitat.  Specifically, we will: (i) examine the habitat-based mechanisms that produce spatial variation in occupant density; (ii) quantify how habitat-driven occupant density feeds back to alter habitat growth and survival; and (iii) apply this knowledge to understand how bidirectional habitat-occupant interactions affect the long-term dynamics, create novel spatial patterns, and drive variation in how systems respond to and recover from disturbances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plate tectonics is only known to occur on Earth, but not on Venus and Mars, and whether Earth always had plate tectonics in its 4.5 billion-year history is unknown. The emergence of plate tectonics on Earth depends on how rocks in the cold uppermost layers of the mantle - the lithosphere - deform.  As rocks deform they can weaken through the process of damage, which concentrates deformation, resulting in more damage, and so on. This positive feedback focuses lithospheric deformation into weak narrow plate boundaries, which are the locus of most seismic and volcanic activity. This project will develop and apply the physics of how mineral grains in rocks are damaged (termed ""grain-damage"") through combined theoretical and laboratory approaches. When mineral grains are deformed they accumulate defects, which eventually leads to grains breaking down into smaller grains, and this in turn makes the rocks weaker. This process is evident in rocks called mylonites that are often found at plate tectonic boundaries. This project will use grain damage physics to understand how and when plate tectonics arose on early Earth.  The project will also study how damage in grains influences cycles of earthquakes at plate boundaries, specifically how rocks weaken, recover and transmit stress to other rocks and eventually trigger more earthquakes. Plate boundary processes have a significant human impact, including evolution of plate boundary fault systems and earthquake recurrence. The project promotes diversity through the support and professional development of two early career female scientists, specifically with interdisciplinary training in theoretical and experimental methods. The project will also involve organization of a symposium on the evolution of plate boundaries for students and young scientists, and will contribute new scientific materials to education and outreach activities at an established scientific visualization facility. <br/><br/>This project will advance the study of lithospheric grain-scale physics and deformation mechanisms, and their application to the generation and operation of plate tectonics. The PI's will extend the grain damage theory for lithospheric weakening and plate boundary formation to include mineralogical phase mixing and dislocation dynamics in polymineralic materials, with calibration and testing by rock deformation experiments. These new developments are necessary to address two major scientific questions:<br/>1. Emergence of plate tectonics: How did tectonic plate boundaries form in the ancient Archean Earth? Did thermal and petrological evolution in the early Earth, namely cooling, decreasing crustal production, and changes in lithospheric composition, affect localization of deformation in the lithosphere and the emergence of plate tectonics? Specifically, the PI's hypothesize that temperature and melting affect mineral composition, which can then influence rock weakening through the positive feedback of grain damage and mixing between petrological phases.<br/>2. Post-seismic creep and lithospheric shear zones: How does transient ductile behavior in the lithosphere, with associated changes in microstructure like grain-size and dislocation density, influence the accumulation, transmission and release of stress following an earthquake? How does this response affect earthquake recurrence cycles and triggering? Does inherited lithospheric weakness, and thus age of a plate boundary, influence post-seismic recovery and earthquake cycles?<br/><br/>To address these questions, the investigators will connect new developments in grain-scale physics to plate-scale geodynamic models using experimentally determined rheological laws. These multi-scale models will provide the platform for coupling plate-boundary formation to thermo-chemical evolution of the upper mantle, and to seismogenic behavior in the crust. The ultimate scientific goal of this project is to understand emergence of plate tectonics on early Earth, and how plate boundary evolution and behavior influences post-seismic response and earthquake cycles. These issues span the time scales of the evolution of Earth's surface in deep time, the development of the neotectonic environment, and the behavior of seismically active zones. The proposed work will use theory and experiments to better understand Earth's tectonic processes on the geological and human time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing agricultural production through irrigation is an essential part of the complex solution to global hunger.  Irrigation can make marginal land suitable for agriculture and existing croplands more productive. However, irrigation is limited by its massive use of water.  Determining the potential of irrigation to reduce global hunger requires a thorough understanding of multiple factors such as climate, agricultural water supply, and crop production.  This project will improve predictions of climate impacts on irrigated croplands by advancing the understanding of key constraints on irrigated agricultural productivity. As a result, it will develop strategies for enhancing future irrigation management.  Knowledge, data, and models will be widely disseminated both directly and through collaborations with the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and Kansas Geological Survey.  This project will also increase knowledge of physical geography, climate science, numerical modeling, and data analysis for students at critical STEM stages.  Additionally, the investigator will create a teaching model that enables high-school students to explore the impacts of climate and water resources on crop production, develop an educator professional development course for the teaching model, and provide research experiences for diverse graduate and undergraduate students intending to major in a STEM field.<br/><br/>Irrigated agricultural projections that directly simulate the impacts of water supply on yield are few, and typically have simplistic representations of crop growth and irrigation.  This project will address this key deficiency through four main efforts: (1) Construct a modeling framework that connects climate and hydrologic data with a crop model capable of simulating limited automatic irrigation; (2) Evaluate and improve the modeling framework using reported yields and satellite-derived evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and vegetation index data; (3) Force the modeling framework with climate and water supply scenarios; and (4) Explore crop water use and production across irrigation scenarios and modeling assumptions.  These efforts will provide answers to three important questions at the interface of climate, water, and agriculture: (1) What are the effects of water supply shortages on irrigated agricultural production?currently and in the future?  (2) Which irrigation management practices can reduce water use without harming yields, and ultimately decrease the impacts of water scarcity on irrigated crop production?  (3) How can satellite data improve crop model simulations of irrigated agricultural production?  This project will focus on irrigated corn, soybean, rice, and wheat in the United States, where irrigation is responsible for approximately 90% of consumptive water use and $120 billion of agricultural production.

Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been filled over and replaced with neighborhoods.  Such geomorphic changes increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides.  Similarly, sea level rise and climate-modulated variations in storm characteristics such as intensity, size and track path also alter flood risk.  The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which these geomorphic and climatic changes alter flood risk.  This goal will be met using a combination of computational modeling, historical climate and storm surge data analysis, and theory-based synthesis.  The study will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate and several graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented groups.  It will improve the well-being of communities within urbanized harbors and estuaries by highlighting coastal development practices that can worsen coastal flooding.  The project plan increases scientific literacy and engagement, and connects the research to applications through interactions with local stakeholders and governments, as well as the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers.<br/><br/>The project will improve the understanding and separation of climatic and geomorphic factors in coastal flooding through several elements of novel research and technical innovation.  The investigators will use a unique tide-gauge data set that extends back to the 19th century together with contemporary, retrospective, and idealized hydrodynamic models to elucidate system sensitivities.  Well-known, simplified insights into tidal dynamics will be tested for storm surge, then used to help interpret how altered local topography, bathymetry and wetland area have changed frictional damping and long-wave mechanics.  A combined analysis of climate, storm characteristics, and morphologic change will identify the modes and pathways through which climate variability and bathymetric change modulate storms surges.  Advanced non-stationary univariate and multivariate statistical models will be developed and employed to incorporate these changes and assess how statistical properties relevant for coastal design and risk assessments respond.

These regions also generate the solar wind, a stream of charged particles, a plasma, that reach the Earth at speeds in excess of 400km/s.   Both the rapidly changing radiation and the solar wind create space weather that results in hazards for spacecraft, astronauts, and also have a number of important impacts on Earth by inducing current surges and disrupting communication.

The damage attributed to cartilage over time presents a tremendous challenge for millions of Americans, and ultimately fosters the development of osteoarthritis. Given this important need to mitigate the damage to cartilage, it is critical that new therapeutic implantable materials are developed for human joints. In order to discover, understand, and ultimately utilize new biomaterial, fundamental knowledge of the behavior of these materials in a complex mechanical stress and biological environment is required. This award will support graduate and undergraduate training on the preparation and evaluation of new therapeutic materials for cartilage tissue repair and will further our understanding of how they respond under stressed environments that lead to osteoarthritis. Additionally, students at Morehouse College will prepare short films to engage society into learning about biomaterial science while also hosting outreach activities for local Atlanta Public School students. This activity will facilitate the development of a community of learners ranging from K-12, undergraduate, post graduate, to adults. <br/><br/><br/>Technical: <br/>Articular cartilage is a highly ordered avascular connective tissue that lines the articular joints and is known to withstand enormous biomechanical loads having a frictionless surface for optimal mobility. However, articular cartilage is limited in its ability to repair itself after defects from disease or injury. At the onset of injury or disease, hypoxia  (low oxygen) disrupt the avascular architecture giving rise to the presence of reactive oxygen species that prevent healthy articular cartilage cell proliferation throughout the three-dimensional cartilage tissue matrix. Biomaterials that promote healthy 3D cell culture and proliferation under hypoxia are currently not available. The objective of this project focuses on the development of thermo-sensitive therapeutic laden hydrogels and the study of hypoxia on cell viability and hydrogel structure and function prepared from 3D printed bio-inks. This research entails the preparation, characterization, 3D printing, biochemical analysis, and spatial mapping of thermo-responsive therapeutic laden hydrogels that provide a new approach to regenerative tissue engineering. The use of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels to improve cell microenvironments and promote healthy extracellular matrix in 3D culture is of particular interest. The governing hypothesis of this project is driven by formulations of hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels with robust structural integrity, higher oxygen diffusion coefficients, and the structural mimicry of articular cartilage zones via 3D printed bio-inks to provide cellular-protection under hypoxia towards chondrogenesis. Using hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels, the Principal Investigator and research team evaluate how hypoxic induced reactive oxygen species mitigate cell fate, ECM amounts, and effect biomaterial properties. The effect of chemical modifications and the impact of structure and function in hybrid therapeutic hydrogels are noted for improved tissue engineering strategies.  The research team approaches include using chemical and polymer synthesis of preparation of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels, material characterization, 3D-printing using flow-based direct ink write, static cell culture of articular chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxia and normoxia, and mechanical stimulation regimes to assess chemical structure phase changes, along with temporal and  spatial localization of extra cellular matrix proteins. Finally, new knowledge will be gained from this research by contributions to the development of novel therapeutic hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration by improving biomaterial properties to endure under pathophysiological conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individual layers may be of the same material, with a prominent example being a bilayer made from two graphene sheets twisted relative to each other. This has recently been demonstrated to support remarkable insulating and superconducting states, with only a small difference in electron density determining which of these behaviors manifests. In other cases, the system may comprise layers of completely different materials, adhering to one another only weakly, so that their basic individual structures remain intact.

The NSF Division of Materials Research (DMR) funds this award, which supports research and educational activities focused on quantum electron states in van der Waals platforms.<br/><br/>The specific systems to be studied involve combinations of graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers, layers of black phosphorus (BP), and surfaces of topological insulators. A graphene-TMD heterostructure, for example, provides a very heterogeneous platform for electrons and holes, with the former supporting gapless Dirac electron states and the latter supporting unusual spin-orbit coupling in its hole states. In these systems, the team will consider the possibility of interlayer particle-hole pairs --excitons-- forming a condensate with behavior unexpected in either material individually (e.g., a valley superfluid.) The highly anisotropic structure of BP offers the possibility of inducing strong anisotropy in a partnered material such as graphene, and the team will explore the effects of this on both the single-particle and collective behavior of the graphene electrons, including the possibility of inducing superconductivity or charge-density-wave states. Studies of aligned graphene on a TI surface, in which the microstructure forms a moire pattern with a large unit cell, will focus on quantum Hall states with spontaneously broken symmetry, where opposing surfaces of the TI, hosting very different electronic states, are topologically tied together. The project also involves studies of twisted bilayer graphene, focusing on observed magnetic field effects in the vicinity of the Mott insulating/superconducting states, where novel electronic ordering may be occurring.<br/><br/>As an NSF-BSF collaboration, this project will provide valuable training for young physicists, in methods for analyzing electronic materials, as well as in learning to work and collaborate within an international setting.

Radio waves at ultra-low frequencies (0.3-3 kHz) serve as both a transport mechanism for energy throughout the magnetosphere and ionosphere and an important diagnostic of the space plasma properties. This project creates a new physics-based model to better understand the dynamics of the near-Earth space environment. The broader impacts of this project include developing new models relevant to our understanding and prediction of space weather - a national priority set out in the National Space Weather Action Plan - and the training of a graduate student.<br/><br/>Ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves play a major role in the transport of energy in the near-Earth regions of the magnetosphere. The research will involve the development of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave code and its application to several problems involving ULF waves in the magnetosphere. The primary focus will be on the application of this model to problems in magnetoseismology, using these waves as a diagnostic of the plasma distribution throughout the magnetosphere. This can be accomplished both by a study of the properties of field line resonances as well as through the travel times of ULF waves from an impulsive source. While previous versions of the wave code have either been two-dimensional, or three-dimensional but with azimuthal symmetry, the code now allows for local time dependence of the ionosphere and plasmasphere. This allows for studies of the day-night differences in the ionosphere as well as the role of conductivity enhancements, such as in the auroral zone, or depletions, as can occur in the sub-auroral plasma trough. Including plasmaspheric asymmetry will allow for the dawn-dusk differences in the plasmasphere structure, including the possible presence of plasmaspheric plumes. Development and application of a global ULF wave model that can investigate these interactions is the primary goal of the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address these important scientific and forecast challenges, the Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific (PRECIP) in summer 2020 will be conducted to improve our understanding of the multi-scale dynamic, thermodynamic, and microphysical processes that produce extreme precipitation. Observations will be collected by the NSF/National Center for Atmospheric Research's S-PolKa and Colorado State University's SEA-POL radars, radiosondes, and disdrometers from 25 May to 10 August 2019 during the latter period of the Meiyu season over Taiwan and transition to the early period of the tropical cyclone (TC) season. <br/><br/>The experimental design of PRECIP is motivated by four key factors: 1) a moisture-rich environment, 2) the presence of both complex terrain and an oceanic environment, 3) a dense operational observing network to augment the specialized field observations, and 4) a high frequency of a variety of heavy rainfall events. Taiwan and the western North Pacific region are a natural laboratory that optimizes all four of these criteria. With high total column water vapor in the region as a fundamental precondition, field observations will be used to test hypotheses related to the presence and roles of key ingredients and processes across scales in different heavy rainfall scenarios.  PRECIP will be conducted in collaboration with the Taiwan-area Atmospheric and Hydrological Observation and Prediction Experiment (TAHOPE) and Japanese Tropical cyclones Pacific Asian Research Campaign for Improvement of Intensity estimations/forecasts (T-PARCII) to add additional synergistic research observations to the campaign.<br/><br/>PRECIP seeks to improve our fundamental understanding and prediction of the processes that produce extreme precipitation through an ingredients-based physical framework. Research observations will be collected in four event types that meet a global definition of 'extreme' across a spectrum of rainfall intensity and duration: deep convective cores, wide convective cores, broad stratiform regions, and TCs.  The field campaign is innovative in its approach to investigate the universal aspects of extreme rainfall by testing hypotheses that are not directed at only one weather phenomenon, and are therefore transferable to rainfall events that affect the United States. The experiment is designed to maximize the chances of observing a variety of heavy rainfall events in the moisture-rich natural laboratory of Taiwan and western North Pacific in order to find the commonalities. The primary objective is to simplify the complexity of multi-scale interactions by identifying key ingredients and processes in the limiting cases of high intensity and long duration events in a moisture-rich environment. Field measurements will be made to address basic research questions about key ingredients, physical processes, mesoscale structures, and prediction improvement. The core observations will consist of multi-frequency radars, radiosondes, disdrometers, and the Taiwan operational weather network that will be integrated with modeling and data analysis and assimilation to better understand the mechanisms that produce extreme rainfall.<br/><br/>Improved forecasts and understanding of the predictability of heavy rainfall will lead to better warnings and risk communication that will have a strong positive impact on society. Improvements to our understanding of orographic and non-orographic precipitation, physical processes, and model capabilities will have broad application to improve other related weather and climate predictions. The PRECIP dataset will also lead to positive impacts in precipitation estimation, data assimilation, radar meteorology, and hydrology. Concurrent projects with TAHOPE and T-PARCII will strengthen international science collaboration in our common goal of improved extreme weather prediction and will help facilitate the application of the campaign findings toward operations in the future. The joint projects will occur during the period leading up to and including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The Olympics will naturally enhance the broader impacts of the PRECIP research, and will provide a focal point for education and outreach promoting the positive role of science to address global problems such as extreme weather. Additional positive broader impacts are expected for graduate students, early career scientists, and underrepresented groups through mentoring, international science collaborations, and leadership opportunities in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To engineer or breed crop varieties that can thrive in marginal environments, it must first be understood how plants sense and integrate responses to Nitrogen (N) and Water (W). Detecting the genes and gene regulatory mechanisms plants rely on to sense and respond to multiple environmental inputs is at the leading edge of efforts to adapt crops to a changing climate. Thus, this award resides in Pasteur's quadrant, the scientific space where fundamental scientific discoveries have applied outcomes. The researchers will discover the molecular mechanisms plants rely on to perceive and integrate the abiotic signals N and W using mutant/transgenic analysis on the genetically tractable model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Initial testing in Arabidopsis will prioritize candidate genes to test in rice. This discovery will be exploited to engineer or breed rice adapted to low-N low-W marginal soils. The research will be linked to the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines (IRRI), which is the primary source of new breeding material for stress-prone regions of Asia. Outcomes of this project have a high probability of impact through immediate consideration for deployment into the IRRI trait development pipeline for marginal soil environments. This project offers a unique application of genomics and systems biology approaches to improve crop performance under stress in translating network knowledge from well-studied models to crops. <br/><br/>While efforts have focused on how plants signal either N or W status, how plants integrate these two abiotic signals remains unexplored. Whether organisms respond to changes in absolute nutrient amount (moles) vs. its concentration in water (molarity) is particularly relevant in agriculture, as soil drying can alter nutrient concentration, without changing its absolute amount. To compare effects of amount vs. concentration, rice was exposed to a factorial matrix varying nitrogen dose (N) and water (W) in range of combinations, and transcriptome and phenotype responses quantified. Using linear models, researchers identified distinct dose responses to either N-moles, W-volume, N-molarity (N/W), or their synergistic interaction (NxW). Importantly, genes whose expression is best explained by N-dose and W interactions (N/W or NxW) were associated with crop outcomes in field trials.  The goal of this grant is to uncover the molecular basis for these N-by-W interactions that affect crop yield.  To this end, a collaborative effort between New York University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines proposes to discover the genes responsible for the integration of N and W inputs in the genetically tractable model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and in rice, one of the world's most important crops. This project will use a multidisciplinary approach that combines genomics, bioinformatics, statistical modeling, and plant physiology to understand how plant genomes sense and integrate N and W signals to optimize plant biomass and grain production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To decipher the profile upon challenge, the adult skeletal muscle will be subjected to an injury or immobilization; microscopy will be utilized to assess the histological phenotype and Western blots will be employed to determine the signaling mechanisms.

By comparing the genes of different individuals, one can detect which individuals are most closely related and reconstruct the history of population splits and speciation, as visualized in a phylogenetic tree. Challenges arise however because of genealogical differences between individuals within each species, current or ancestral.  This project focuses on the detection of species convergences: when species hybridize, or when individuals from one species migrate to another, or when strains recombine. The history of a group of species is then best described by a network, where a backbone tree represents speciation and extra branches describe gene flow from one population into another. Current methods to estimate phylogenetic networks cannot analyze data sets with more than a few dozen species. Based on novel theoretical foundations, the PIs will develop statistical methods and software that will scale to hundreds of species and thousands of genetic loci. These new methods will also be particularly valuable to advance knowledge in bacterial and virus evolution, where recombination is prevalent. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students, who will gain training beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries with involvement in the larger community of campus researchers interested in networks in data science.<br/><br/>Through the mathematical analysis of coalescent processes on phylogenetic networks, the PIs will determine the maximal substructures of these networks that can be theoretically identified from various data types, such as from gene trees, or genetic distances between pairs of individuals, using one or more individuals per populations. Theory will also be developed to determine the amount of data necessary to reconstruct the phylogenetic network with accuracy. These theoretical findings will guide the development of new statistical methods and software to estimate phylogenetic networks from data, with a focus on the use of genetic distances to devise fast algorithms that can handle hundreds of species. These fast reconstruction methods will allow the deployment of a cross-validation method to learn from data the appropriate complexity of the network, that is, the appropriate number of gene flow events. The proposed research will advance knowledge of the evolutionary history in many groups where gene flow and recombination is suspected, such as the early radiation of mammals or land plants, and the evolutionary history of the herpes virus family.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are a huge variety of mechanisms suggested for accelerating electrons in the region of the geomagnetic field known as the current sheet. This project will help distinguish between these theories to help determine which are at work in the magnetosphere. This is directly relevant to the National Space Weather Plan, since the work can lead to better models and forecasts of space weather, which affects national commercial and defense satellites and space-based communications. Additionally, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research.<br/><br/>This project quantifies the impact of the electron thermal anisotropy on the magnetotail current sheet structure and investigates the variation of characteristics of electron thermal anisotropy with geomagnetic activity. The anisotropic electron population can be responsible for generation of strong currents (induced by particle curvature drifts) and can serve as an energy source for various electromagnetic wave emissions. The project uses observations from five spacecraft missions (Geotail, Cluster, THEMIS, ARTEMIS, and MMS) covering the entire magnetotail within the radial distances from 10 to 80 Earth radii downtail. Using several years of THEMIS/ARTEMIS observations in the near-Earth and middle magnetotail, the work studies both the radial distribution of the electron thermal anisotropy and the impact of electron anisotropic currents on current sheet structure for different magnetotail configurations. Moreover, using MMS observations with the high-resolution plasma measurements the work will for the first time statistically reveal the fine structure of the electron anisotropic population and its contribution to the current density.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animals and humans can easily and deftly respond to touch anywhere on their skin. As a result, for example, a human can pick up a handful of objects in the dark or a worm can feel its way through an underground burrow. However, The approaches that work to control sensors and actuators on robots may not scale up for more degrees of freedom and sensors. Soft robots are especially imprecise and often designed for contact, which means more robust, intelligent control is needed. Separating the control problem into simpler subparts called primitives can make controller design and adaptation easier. Such primitives seem to be fundamental to biological nervous systems. The goal of this project is to establish a format for primitives that are responsive, specifically to local contact sensing. These primitives will be applied to two common types of robot problems: manipulation and locomotion. The project is a step toward enabling more life-like performance in robots and better understanding of the complexity of biological intelligence. <br/><br/>This project will build on the widely used Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) framework by replacing the stable equilibria and limit cycles with connected saddle equilibria.  The saddle equilibria will enable the timing of the system states to vary with sensory input, resulting in Responsive Movement Primitives (RMP).  We will explore two design approaches to RMP: converting directly from DMP and extending a previous saddle-based controller to additional degrees of freedom. The first approach will be implemented for a hyper-redundant grasping problem because this relates to published DMP benchmarks.  This study has the potential to help robots pick up multiple objects in a single grasp.  The second approach will be implemented for peristaltic worm-like locomotion problem and leverages the investigator?s prior research.  This study will help engineers better understand how soft body locomotion can be used to access constrained spaces with potential future application in medicine, infrastructure access, and search and rescue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The simultaneous occurrence of convective clouds over a large region can sometimes be explained in terms of external factors, such as continental heating or surface wind convergence driven by sea surface temperature (SST) contrasts. But perhaps convection can also aggregate spontaneously: not because external factors favor it, but because convection itself creates favorable conditions for additional convection. Such self-aggregation, in which convection begets convection, has been found in idealized simulations of the tropical atmosphere by the PIs and others.<br/><br/>In these simulations self-aggregation is typically temperature dependent, increasing with SSTs, and as convection aggregates skies clear and dry in the non-convecting areas. The loss of energy to space by longwave radiation from the clear-sky regions subsequently cools the SSTs, which reduces aggregation and restores the sea surface to its original temperature. This restorative feedback loop could exert a powerful influence on the temperature of the tropics, acting to reduce both the variability of tropical SSTs and the increase in SSTs due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.<br/><br/>The notion of self-aggregation as a tropical thermostat is intriguing, but so far the effect has been demonstrated and studied primarily in idealized models. Simplifications used in these models include limited geographical domain, uniform SSTs, and periodic lateral boundaries. More work is thus needed to determine if thermal regulation through self-aggregation is a robust effect in the real world. A logical next step in this direction is to look at self-aggregation in more sophisticated models.<br/><br/>Under this award the Principal Investigators (PIs) examine the mechanisms of self-aggregation, and its potency for thermal regulation, in a global cloud resolving model called the System for Atmospheric Modeling. The model, developed by one of the PIs, can simulate the forms of convective aggregation seen in satellite images, including hurricanes and the large-scale Madden-Julian Oscillation. The model allows experiments in which various mechanisms thought to be responsible for aggregation are suppressed by direct intervention. For instance the importance of cloud longwave radiative effects can be assessed by averaging the radiative flux between clear and cloudy areas, thereby suppressing longwave radiation as a mechanism for aggregation. The model also includes a sophisticated representation of cloud microphysics, which enables tests of the sensitivity of aggregation to specific cloud properties. One issue to be addressed is the sensitivity of aggregation to the radiative properties of ice crystals near the tops of the clouds.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the large and populous portion of the earth that would be affected by the self-aggregation thermostat. A better understanding of convective aggregation could also be beneficial for predicting tropical weather, and results of this work could inform the development of forecast models. One area that could benefit is hurricane prediction, as hurricanes form from tropical cloud clusters, and the prediction of hurricane genesis remains a challenge. In addition, the project provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, ?parent? bodies of meteorites have been determined by comparing the way those meteorites and specific asteroids reflect sunlight. However, the parent body of the most common type of meteorites seen to fall, known as ordinary chondrites, has yet to be firmly identified. The team's hypothesis is that a group known as L-chondrites come from the (20) Massalia family of asteroids (An asteroid family is a group of asteroids with orbits more similar than would be expected by chance). The team will use telescopes to break down the light reflected by the Massalia asteroids for comparison with L-chondrites studied in the laboratory. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be included in the research. This project is jointly funded by NSF AST and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Main belt asteroids are the sole surviving in situ remnants from the formation epoch of the inner Solar System. With few exceptions, meteorites are samples of main belt asteroids. Meteorites thus provide a window into the condition and processes in the late stages of the solar nebula and the earliest evolution of the inner Solar System. Studying meteorites tells us about the geochemistry and petrology of the Solar System, and about its age (from radiometric dating), but nothing about where these processes occurred. If the L-chondrites can be linked to a specific asteroid family, the late nebular and early solar system location of the conditions and processes recorded by the L-chondrites can be constrained. Moreover, the age of that family can be established by the shock ages of the L-chondrites. A firm constraint on the age of a family would allow a more rigorous testing and refining of dynamical models of orbital diffusion in the asteroid belt. Such models are important for: A) constraining the sources of Earth-approaching meteoroids and asteroids, B) for modeling the dynamical evolution of the asteroid population, and C) for estimating the ages of other asteroid families and hence the frequency of large collisions in the belt. The overall goal of the present study is to test the (20) Massalia asteroid family as a potential source of the L-chondrites. This work will be done by comparing spectra of Massalia asteroids for comparison with laboratory spectra of L-chondritic meteorites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data centers are projected to consume between 9% and 20% of the world's total power by 2025, so improved performance and efficiency are important to the health of our planet. Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are reconfigurable hardware with flexibility to become any specialized hardware on demand. They are compelling in modern data centers because they enable a wide range of accelerators to be synthesized from a single reconfigurable device; providers such as Amazon and Microsoft now support FPGA acceleration in the cloud. However, the paradigm shift to reconfigurable hardware is massive for traditional operating systems, which are designed to manage fixed-function devices. Current systems assume a single application has exclusive access to the hardware, and the lack of sharing support limits utilization and efficiency.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop system-level abstractions and end-to-end operating system (OS) support for protected FPGA sharing that improves utilization and throughput by an order of magnitude or more. This is challenging because FPGA accelerators are ephemeral and malleable: they may change frequently and be able to scale with increased shares of FPGA resource. These properties run counter to decades-old OS design assumptions. The project aims for a complete open-source stack that supports efficient high-utilization protected sharing for server processes to offload computations to FPGAs, and will extend it to function as a compatibility layer for cloud FPGA platforms. Measurements of an initial prototype called AmorphOS show that the approach has promise and can improve utilization and throughput by 8X and 32X for Microsoft Catapult and Amazon F1 systems running neural network (DNN) inference. The system has the possibility to be used pervasively in data centers supporting FPGAs, and the results of the work could guide the design of the next generation of operating systems for heterogeneous and reconfigurable hardware.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these processes occur in aquifers and the way that porosity, permeability, and rock surface chemistry change over time is crucial to predicting how contaminants move or the quality of water changes.  Computer simulations are often used to help understand how soils and aquifers change over years and centuries but simulation is difficult because measurements of reaction rate in the laboratory are so different from measurements in nature and the reason is not clear.  The proposed project will seek to reconcile these differences by using advanced imaging methods, laboratory rock weathering experiments, and computer simulations. This will help us simulate and better understand such processes as contaminant fate, carbon dioxide sequestration, the dissolution and precipitation of minerals, and changes in water quality. The project supports a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students who will be engaged to help increase interest in STEM fields in K- 12 students through involvement in outreach activities and the Auburn University OutCELL educational programs. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal is to enhance understanding and simulation of the rate, extent, and impact of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions in subsurface systems to better predict flow and transport in these systems, enabling improved risk and impact assessment. As a step towards this goal, the research objective of this CAREER proposal is to test the hypothesis that mineral reaction rates and permeability evolution are a function of mineral accessible surface areas, porosity and pore connectivity. The approach will be to carry out core scale laboratory dissolution experiments, use imaging methods to measure the reactive evolution of accessible mineral surface area, porosity, and pore connectivity, and integrate imaging observations into reactive transport simulations of dissolution experiments. My long-term educational goal is to equip students with the knowledge and skills to assess fate and transport in environmental systems and develop and implement solutions to environmental problems. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective of this proposal is to increase understanding and awareness of K-12, undergraduate and graduate students of water-rock interactions in environmental systems. The educational approach is to expand K-12 awareness through demonstrations at the Auburn student-led OutCELL facility, develop new undergraduate/graduate course materials, and establish a permanent interdisciplinary student seminar series.

For example, when a car on autopilot failed to recognize a white truck against a bright-lit sky, it crashed into the truck, killing the driver. To avoid such costly and unsafe failures, this project develops a framework for rigorously and automatically testing AI algorithms, specifically computer vision systems, in a 3D environment. In addition, via the framework, the project attempts to uncover why an algorithm makes a given decision. Providing explanations understandable by humans for decisions made by machines is crucial in gaining users' trust, advancing AI algorithms, and complying with the current and future legal regulations on the use of AI with sensitive human data.<br/><br/>Researchers previously attempted to achieve the two main goals of (1) testing and (2) interpreting computer vision systems by synthesizing a 2D input image that fails a target image recognition model. However, the existing methods operate at the pixel level, generating special patterns that (a) are hard to explain; (b) might not transfer well to the physical world; and (c) may rarely be encountered in reality. Instead of optimizing in the 2D image space, the research objective of this project is to harness 3D graphics engines to create a 3D scene where the factors of variations (e.g. lighting, object geometry and appearances, background images) can be controlled and optimized to cause a target computer vision system to misbehave. This research effort will (1) reveal systematic defects via automatically testing the target model across many controlled, disentangled settings; and (2) improve the existing interpretability methods by incorporating 3D information.

As these systems become more sophisticated, they will interact increasingly with humans. With this increased human-agent interaction comes an increased obligation to ensure that autonomous systems do not cause even unintentional harm to a human. Creating systems that cannot intentionally or unintentionally harm humans in not an easy task. This is because there are infinitely many undesirable outcomes that can be achieved in an open world, making it impossible to instruct these systems to avoid each one. If the desired behavior cannot be directly specified, then it must be learned. Past approaches to learn these types of behaviors have focused on learning from human examples, but these methods are unlikely to scale. This research uses natural language explanations of behavior as a scalable alternative for training autonomous agents for safe operation. Naturalistic descriptions contain vast amounts of information about sociocultural norms, which make them rich sources for such training. Enabling systems to better understand and learn from such descriptions will enable human operators to more naturally specify goals or tasks for the agent to complete.<br/><br/>This research explores the concept of learning via natural language descriptions of desired behavior. This technique uses procedural knowledge contained in natural language explanations to help train autonomous agents. Concretely, this approach learns utility functions that can be used to guide autonomous agents towards behaviors that are aligned with the description used for training. To accomplish this, researchers will create computational models capable of extracting both knowledge about sociocultural norms as well as procedural knowledge from naturally occurring corpora. These models will then be used to create behavior policies that are both aligned with sociocultural norms and procedurally plausible. To further ensure that these models can be practically deployed, researchers will enable their models to incorporate a ""human in the loop"" to provide online feedback about the quality of these learned behavior policies in terms of their social acceptability and appropriateness. Safeguards will also be investigated to protect the learned behavior policies against the effects of adversarial or malicious training examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The instrument to be acquired is specialized for the analysis technique of clumped isotope paleothermometry, and while relatively new has been shown to prove useful for independently estimating the temperature of formation of carbonates in the ancient sedimentary, rock and fossil records.  The instrument would be first-of-its kind in the SE U.S., with the exception of south Florida and benefit researchers across the states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North and South Carolina.  The investigators intend to engage graduate and undergraduate students in experiential learning using the new instrument and will work with a local HBCU, Fort Valley State University, in a cross-university collaboration to facilitate the recruitment of underrepresented students to the geosciences.<br/><br/>The IRMS to be acquired will be capable of making routine ?clumped? isotope ratio measurements of the double substituted isotopologue 13C16O18O or mass 47 clump, which is a measure of the enrichment of the number of CO2 molecules containing a 13C-18O bond above the number expected by a random distribution of carbon and oxygen isotopes.  Clumped isotopic analysis can be used to independently infer the temperature of formation of carbonates at the time they were precipitated (paleothermometry) without any assumptions about the oxygen isotopic composition of the water from which they precipitated.  Clumped isotope paleothermometry is a relatively new technique which has been primarily employed in the analysis of ancient carbonate material from multiple sources, including shallow diagenetic fluids, dolomitization, soil carbonates, speleothems, methane seeps, and a variety of biogenic carbonates (e.g., bivalves and corals).  As the technique is relatively new there is still active development work being conducted on standardization techniques and inter-laboratory comparisons are being made.  Research applications will include, but are not limited to, studies of the effects of climate on the proliferation of human civilization and how different food sources were utilized and prepared by indigenous populations; paleontological investigations of the growth rates of extinct organisms; paleoclimate changes across mass extinction boundaries; and studies of the importance of diagenesis in Precambrian carbonates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine the impact of recent declines in state support for public universities on scientific research output. Since the Great Recession, several states cut appropriations to higher education, and nineteen states have not restored funding to 2008 levels. Yet few studies have examined the relationship between federal and non-federal research funding, and none have investigated the relationship between state funding for higher education and research output. In addition, researchers have debated whether there are diminishing returns to science funding. Diminishing returns occur when each additional dollar of funding results in fewer publications and citations. The results of this research will allow policymakers to make informed decisions about the allocation of scarce funding resources to higher education at the state and federal levels.<br/><br/>The proposed research will examine the effect of changes in support for higher education funding to examine the returns to science funding in terms of publications and citations across science and social science disciplines. First, the project will use new data that links publications, citations and grants to individual faculty members at research universities to model the returns to scale of science funding across several disciplines. Variation across these fields will shed light on the returns to scale in science funding. Second, the project will examine whether state funding of higher education is a substitute or complement for federal research funding in the production of research output measured by publications and citations. If state funding is a complement for federal research funding, one would expect that federal research dollars would fall in states that experienced budget cuts. Third, the project will use individual level data on scientists and state budget shocks to higher education funding to examine the impact of faculty mobility on the research productivity of sending and receiving institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As outbreaks of infectious diseases get more common and severe, understanding how populations can survive when faced with deadly pathogens is increasingly important. Evolutionary rescue, which happens when a population evolves to survive environmental change that would otherwise cause extinction, may provide a way for some populations to persist in a changing world. Most studies of evolutionary rescue have focused on non-living drivers of environmental change (e.g., pollution, extreme temperatures), with little known regarding the role that evolutionary rescue plays in response to disease. In this project researchers will study a species of water flea (Daphnia) whose populations' challenges due to both non-living environmental change and pathogen infection are well known. By identifying the conditions that allow a population of water fleas to experience evolutionary rescue in response to disease the researchers will gain knowledge that will help in management and control of infectious diseases in many other systems. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on those from underrepresented groups. Additionally, the investigators will develop interactive classroom activities for undergraduate biology courses and organize a workshop to train early-career scientists in methods of modeling infectious disease. <br/><br/>The investigators will combine experimental manipulations, genotyping, transcriptomics, and modeling to study evolutionary rescue in response to the introduction of a pathogen. They will address the following complementary questions: (1) How does evolutionary rescue in response to a pathogen differ from evolutionary rescue in response to an abiotic stressor? (2) Can abiotic stress facilitate evolutionary rescue from disease? and (3) What are the effects of community diversity on a population's evolutionary response to a pathogen? The proposed work will address these questions by utilizing a highly tractable Daphnia-pathogen system to perform experimental manipulations of populations at multiple scales (laboratory to outdoor mesocosm) while tracking demographic and genetic changes through time. Experimental manipulations will be paired with modeling efforts to identify mechanisms and generalize the results to additional host-pathogen systems. This approach will provide novel insight into how populations can respond and recover from outbreaks of infectious disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, minor compositional modifications that occur locally in a material can lead to drastic changes in properties such as corrosion resistance, catalytic function, fracture strength, and interfacial adhesion. This project seeks to uncover the dependence of surface segregation on controllable parameters such as bulk composition, surface orientation and morphology, and external stimuli as well as the microscopic mechanism of the surface segregation process. The fundamental insight will have considerable practical importance for a wide range of material systems, properties, and reactions because segregation not only modifies surface chemistry and composition but also the atomic structure and strain state in the surface and subsurface regions in multicomponent materials. The fundamental knowledge of the prototypes of basic processes controlling surface composition and structure evolution will open up new perspectives of designing alloys with desired surface properties by manipulating bulk properties of the alloy and their interplay with the surroundings. As part of this research program, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will learn about new microscopy, spectroscopy and computational techniques as well as work on materials issues that are at the forefront of current materials research. The training of students in the broader area of materials science will result in future leaders that are better equipped to solve the complex energy and environmental problems that face society. Results from this project will also be incorporated into undergraduate- and graduate-level courses and high school outreach programs to advance nanomaterials-related education.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:	<br/>Although phase diagrams delineating the thermodynamic conditions for phase/structure selection in bulk alloys are well established, the composition and structure of an alloy surface can be significantly different from those of the bulk due to the surface segregation of the alloying element. A microscopic understanding of many physical and chemical processes taking place at the surface of multicomponent materials requires as a prerequisite atomic-scale understanding of surface segregation induced compositional and structural evolution. Despite this importance, the atomic processes governing the onset, promotion, and termination of surface segregation under practical conditions are largely unknown. This project employs atomistically informed approaches toward a mechanistic understanding of surface segregation phenomena by gaining transformational knowledge of surface compositional and structural dynamics of alloys. The research is based on a combined atomistic experimental and computational program with tightly integrated feedback loops, including quantitative in-situ metrology that uses complementary forefront techniques for dynamically measuring surface composition, structure and chemistry of the alloys under realistic environment conditions and closely coordinated atomistic modeling ranging from first-principles calculations to large-scale molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The comprehensive understanding will shed light on many multicomponent systems due to a shared set of prototypical basic processes governing surface segregation, including thermodynamic driving forces, interplay between chemical ordering and elemental segregation, and kinetic obstacles of atomic exchanges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As it turns out, solving such systems exactly is, apart from a few very special cases, essentially impossible. We thus attempt to describe the solution sets more qualitatively. One classically fruitful approach to this is to consider the set of solutions as a topological space, an object sitting in some higher dimensional space.  For instance, the equation x^2+y^2=1 describes a circle of radius 1.  Topologists have invented invariants for qualitatively describing topological spaces, and we can just attempt to work out these invariants for the special spaces we are interested in. Taking this idea to its extreme, one arrives at a field called motivic homotopy theory. It provides novel ways for qualitatively describing solutions of systems of polynomial equations, and has in the past twenty years been successfully applied to several longstanding open problems in algebraic geometry.  This project aims to deepen our understanding of motivic homotopy theory by exploring further not only its parallels with classical topology, but also what happens where these parallels break down.<br/><br/>This project consists of several parts. One set of parts explores properties of motivic highly structured ring spectra, called normed spectra (introduced in collaboration with M. Hoyois).  The Principal Investigator (P.I.) will (1) study power operations in normed spectra and deduce splitting results for normed spectra of positive characteristic and stability results for the motivic homology of symmetric groups and (2) construct further normed spectra, such as a normed spectrum structure on the motivic spectrum KO representing hermitian K-theory.  Another set of parts explores the passage from unstable to stable motivic homotopy theory. Specifically the P.I. will (3) study the motivic Barratt-Priddy-Quillen map, and (4) study an unstable motivic homology Whitehead theorem.  These goals will be achieved by using techniques from higher category theory, classical stable homotopy theory, algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. The results in parts (1) and (2) can be used to more effectively study algebraic varieties using cohomology theories; for example by exploiting the cohomology operations present in theories represented by normed spectra. Parts (3) and (4) are more useful for studying the motivic (stable) homotopy category itself, and hence the totality of all cohomology theories for algebraic varieties at once.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conversion of coal and biomass into useful fuel, thermal storage by particulate material, and particle-based solar receivers, all represent promising technologies that rely heavily on heat transfer in multiphase systems. Current tools used in industry and academia rely on simplistic models for average reaction rates as well as heat transfer coefficients that are known to vary by several orders of magnitude. This project introduces a new modeling approach that will enable researchers to address the huge range of challenges associated with heat transfer through gas-particle mixtures. For a broader educational impact, a toy version of a fluidized bed will be built with beads sprayed with thermochromic liquid crystals that change color with temperature. This will be presented at local schools to illustrate fundamental concepts of fluid-particle interactions.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers from Michigan, Iowa State, and Minnesota collaborate to develop a new paradigm in multiphase heat transfer modeling. The aim is to bridge the gap between particle-scale thermal processes and device-scale predictions. A consistent modeling framework is formulated that scales from a well-accepted physics-based model to a larger scale of interest. Current approaches typically ensemble-average data obtained from the microscale physics directly, without taking into account local variations on scales resolvable by the simulation framework. The proposed effort will connect the spatially-averaged, large-scale representation to two-phase statistics obtained from particle-resolved numerical simulations. A previously overlooked ergodic consistency requirement will be enforced so that the numerical solution converges to the ensemble-averaged two-fluid equations in the limit of large filter width. Model validation will be based on simultaneous multi-camera imaging at different scales, and a novel application of Voronoi tessellation to quantify clustering in dense suspensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But how did communities in the countryside experience vacillations between security and insecurity, resulting from alternating episodes of peace and conflict, and decades of climate stability followed by periods of drought? Drs. Charles Golden (Brandeis University), Andrew Scherer (Brown University), Timothy Murtha (University of Florida) together with colleagues in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will address this fundamental question. To address this question they will focus on the relationships among climate warfare and agricultural intensification. The research will provide a first step towards understanding the entanglement (or lack thereof) between war and the agricultural economy in the western Maya lowlands, with implications for understanding human-environmental and political dynamics more broadly. The natural and cultural resources of the Usumacinta River Basin in which the research will take place and other areas of the neotropics are being devastated by looting, illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture, and livestock management practices that can result in devastating wildfires in a landscape plagued in recent decades by drought. Understanding long-term uses of the landscape will help to address contemporary land use issues and assist in planning for sustainability. <br/><br/>This research continues the investigators efforts to enhance understandings of ancient Maya defensive features and warfare generally and represents a new attempt to identify the potential economic causes and consequences of war for the ancient Maya.  The western Maya lowlands is an ideal case for the study of the relationship between social strife and agricultural production. With a robust epigraphic record and decades of archaeological fieldwork, the region hosted a diversity of polities in terms of their strategies of governance and socio-political integration. The proposed research will also advance understanding of ancient Maya agricultural systems. The study area is the wettest region of the Maya lowlands, where little work has considered agricultural dynamics over the long term. Such regional comparison is critical for synthetic statements about agricultural regimes that are often based on research conducted in the distinct ecological zones of the Central Peten, Belize, and northern Yucatan.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the hazards driven by weather patterns, ground deformation due to landslides has immense global impacts. Large portions of the Earth's surface are at risk to ground failures, affecting a considerable fraction of the world's population. Landslides cause a global annual death toll of several thousand and financial losses of more than $1B per year in the United States alone. The most formidable challenge in predicting ground failures derives from their ability to suddenly accelerate despite the lack of observed precursors. In fact, natural slopes can deform in multiple ways, sometimes by displaying slow movements, while at other times moving rapidly in a fluidized state. Such modes of deformation coexist at the same site, affect portions of terrain proximal to one another, and may be experienced by the same hillslopes at different times. The current scarcity of predictive large-scale ground deformation models is largely a consequence of the poor spatial coverage of ground-based monitoring data. To overcome these obstacles, this project will rely on technological advances in remote sensing that allow the detection of rainfall patterns and ground movements at spatiotemporal resolutions that were unthinkable just a decade ago. These observational advances have the potential to unleash new formulation, calibration and validation possibilities for hydrologic and ground deformation models by means of abundant, openly-available, spatially-distributed information. Specifically, the project is motivated by the idea that pre-failure deformations have much to say about when, how, and why ground failure occurs, and aims to demonstrate that analyzing the deformation signature of the ground is the key to explain why hillslopes fail in different ways when subjected to variable weather patterns. If successful, this project will lead to new ways to decode the physical origin of ground instability and define measurable precursors of catastrophic landslide triggering, thus potentially inspiring the design of innovative real-time early warning systems able to better protect human life and infrastructure. <br/><br/>During the course of this project, the interaction between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere will be studied from a new multi-disciplinary perspective. Specifically, the project will formulate: (1) rheological laws for geomaterials able to explain variations in landslide velocity resulting from dynamically changing environmental conditions; (2) a multiscale weather-hydrology simulation platform able to quantify spatially heterogeneous rainfall inputs and soil moisture at the scale of mountain ranges; (3) landscape-scale geomechanical models able to reproduce the evolution of remotely sensed deformations via force-transfer laws between proximal portions of terrain; (4) a network theory for surface processes based on the physics of complex systems, by which patterns can be identified and precursors of runaway instability defined. Such a combination of methods will provide a comprehensive representation of landslide dynamics, thus improving our ability to forecast landslides and mitigate hazards at the landscape scale. Most importantly, it will provide innovative tools to address open questions in the domain of hazard forecasting, such as: (i) Can we use landscape-scale observations to infer the rheology of hillslopes? (ii) Which landscape-scale measurements are most useful for predicting the fate of incipient landslides? (iii) Is the concurrent collection of spatially-distributed data of rainfall patterns and displacement rates sufficient to identify landslide precursors? These questions will be answered by combining data from state-of-the-art remote sensing tools (e.g., satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar, high-resolution digital elevation models, and weather radar) with physics-based constitutive laws for soil and rock deformation, atmospheric-hydrologic models, and complex network theories. Rich datasets available for a variety of geological settings and earthen materials within and outside the United States will be used to test the predictive capabilities of the proposed approaches. This strategy will offer unique opportunities to validate the concepts at the core of the project and test their applicability to a wide range of geomorphic and climatic contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the world population continues to grow, water resources become scarcer, particularly brackish water in arid and semi-arid regions such as the southwestern U.S. Adequate access to low-cost, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable methods for advanced water treatment requires development and characterization of new membrane technologies. Water treatment processes typically use several types of membranes, including microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis membranes. Ultrafiltration membranes play a key role in the removal of suspended particles, viruses, and bacteria. Ultrafiltration membranes are also among the most commonly employed separation techniques, with applications in food processing, chemical manufacturing, and protein purification. Despite their industrial relevance, ultrafiltration membranes are produced by a method called non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS), which requires the use of large quantities of organic solvents. Membranes produced by the NIPS process are also anisotropic with low surface porosity, leading to increased fouling on the surface of the membrane. The overall goal of this project is to develop ultrafiltration membranes through cost-effective green chemistry, while simultaneously increasing their permeability, to reduce the cost and energy of water treatment. Research and education are integrated in the project through undergraduate research opportunities and the development of research-related course materials. <br/><br/>Fouling control, particularly the control of biofouling, has been a major focus of wastewater and water treatment research. However, many previously proposed methods to overcome fouling are neither cost-effective nor extensible to different chemical structures and polymers. Since filtration processes result in membrane fouling that reduces the flux over the time, a surface washing process can be utilized to clean the surface of a membrane. However, the low surface porosity of NIPS membranes intensifies the fouling, which cannot completely be removed through backwashing. Backwashing is also a major energy consumption step in filtration. Ultrafiltration membranes with (i) improved permeability and decreased fouling, without compromising the rejection rate, and (ii) stimuli-responsive behavior to aid in surface washing are needed. The ability to produce these membranes in an eco-friendly manner without the need to synthesize new or costly chemicals also remains an outstanding technological challenge. The PI proposes to address these challenges using an organic-solvent-free templating approach to produce nanoporous polymers for ultrafiltration applications. Amphiphilic block copolymer self-assembly in mixtures of water and an oil phase containing monomers will be used as a template. Monomers in the oil phase, upon polymerization, undergo a conformation-change response to temperature and pH stimuli due to change in hydrophobicity. The pore size of such membranes can be manipulated for controlling the molecular weight cut-off and anti-fouling behavior. Because a higher density of nanometer-sized pores can be uniformly incorporated into the polymers relative to existing ultrafiltration membrane technology, the permeability of membranes produced from this method is also expected to exceed that of commercial products without compromising the rejection rate. Membrane structure will be characterized using polarized light microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and treansmission electron microscopy. Permeability, molecular weight cut-off, fouling, and solute rejection will be examined through pressure-driven filtration experiments. The outcome of the study will be foundational knowledge for making high-permeability ultrafiltration membranes with stimuli-responsive pores through a green-chemistry approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A core component of the method is a loss function that called Ordinal Hyperplane Loss (OHPL). OHPL is particularly designed for data with ordinal classes and enables deep learning techniques to be applied to the ordinal classification problems. By minimizing OHPL, a deep neural network learns to map data to an optimal space where the distance between points and their class centroid hyper-plane are minimized while a nontrivial ordinal relationship among classes are maintained. Preliminary experimental results indicate that deep neural network with OHPL optimizing significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives on classification accuracies across multiple datasets.

As these systems become more sophisticated, they will interact increasingly with humans. With this increased human-agent interaction comes an increased obligation to ensure that autonomous systems do not cause even unintentional harm to a human. Creating systems that cannot intentionally or unintentionally harm humans in not an easy task. This is because there are infinitely many undesirable outcomes that can be achieved in an open world, making it impossible to instruct these systems to avoid each one. If the desired behavior cannot be directly specified, then it must be learned. Past approaches to learn these types of behaviors have focused on learning from human examples, but these methods are unlikely to scale. This research uses natural language explanations of behavior as a scalable alternative for training autonomous agents for safe operation. Naturalistic descriptions contain vast amounts of information about sociocultural norms, which make them rich sources for such training. Enabling systems to better understand and learn from such descriptions will enable human operators to more naturally specify goals or tasks for the agent to complete.<br/><br/>This research explores the concept of learning via natural language descriptions of desired behavior. This technique uses procedural knowledge contained in natural language explanations to help train autonomous agents. Concretely, this approach learns utility functions that can be used to guide autonomous agents towards behaviors that are aligned with the description used for training. To accomplish this, researchers will create computational models capable of extracting both knowledge about sociocultural norms as well as procedural knowledge from naturally occurring corpora. These models will then be used to create behavior policies that are both aligned with sociocultural norms and procedurally plausible. To further ensure that these models can be practically deployed, researchers will enable their models to incorporate a ""human in the loop"" to provide online feedback about the quality of these learned behavior policies in terms of their social acceptability and appropriateness. Safeguards will also be investigated to protect the learned behavior policies against the effects of adversarial or malicious training examples.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the Office of Integrative Activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, minor compositional modifications that occur locally in a material can lead to drastic changes in properties such as corrosion resistance, catalytic function, fracture strength, and interfacial adhesion. This project seeks to uncover the dependence of surface segregation on controllable parameters such as bulk composition, surface orientation and morphology, and external stimuli as well as the microscopic mechanism of the surface segregation process. The fundamental insight will have considerable practical importance for a wide range of material systems, properties, and reactions because segregation not only modifies surface chemistry and composition but also the atomic structure and strain state in the surface and subsurface regions in multicomponent materials. The fundamental knowledge of the prototypes of basic processes controlling surface composition and structure evolution will open up new perspectives of designing alloys with desired surface properties by manipulating bulk properties of the alloy and their interplay with the surroundings. As part of this research program, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will learn about new microscopy, spectroscopy and computational techniques as well as work on materials issues that are at the forefront of current materials research. The training of students in the broader area of materials science will result in future leaders that are better equipped to solve the complex energy and environmental problems that face society.

A microscopic understanding of many physical and chemical processes taking place at the surface of multicomponent materials requires as a prerequisite atomic-scale understanding of surface segregation induced compositional and structural evolution. Despite this importance, the atomic processes governing the onset, promotion, and termination of surface segregation under practical conditions are largely unknown. This project employs atomistically informed approaches toward a mechanistic understanding of surface segregation phenomena by gaining transformational knowledge of surface compositional and structural dynamics of alloys. The research is based on a combined atomistic experimental and computational program with tightly integrated feedback loops, including quantitative in-situ metrology that uses complementary forefront techniques for dynamically measuring surface composition, structure and chemistry of the alloys under realistic environment conditions and closely coordinated atomistic modeling ranging from first-principles calculations to large-scale molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The comprehensive understanding will shed light on many multicomponent systems due to a shared set of prototypical basic processes governing surface segregation, including thermodynamic driving forces, interplay between chemical ordering and elemental segregation, and kinetic obstacles of atomic exchanges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While this aggregated data can have tremendous benefit for consumers and data scientists via technologies built on machine learning and artificial intelligence, this benefit must be tempered with meaningful assurances of privacy for the very people who provided the data in the first place. This project adopts a rigorous information-theoretic approach to give meaningful privacy guarantees while still providing statistical utility. By combining theoretical and data-driven research, this project can inform public policy as well as best-practices for industry. The overall goal is to provide any data scientist with a set of tools to guarantee meaningful privacy in practice. To do so, this project explores meaningful measures of privacy leakage in the learning context, characterizes the fundamental tradeoffs between privacy and utility, develops techniques to ensure privacy in realistic settings, and tests these algorithms on publicly available datasets. The project is also committed to broadening participation in computing via two outreach efforts: (i) interactive demonstrations of privacy issues that stem from using social media to middle and high school students via ASU's annual STEM event, Open Door, and (ii) teaching modules on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), and short courses (""data jams"") at ASU via the Young Engineers Shape the World (YESW) summer program and at Harvard; these modules, targeted at female, financially disadvantaged, and Latino and Hispanic students, aim to make a meaningful contribution to increasing a diverse STEM workforce by providing students hands-on experience on basic concepts of coding, manipulating datasets, and producing simple visualizations collectively. Outreach efforts will be evaluated using well understood metrics for assessment of student interest, engagement, and knowledge via ASU?s College Research and Evaluation Services Team (CREST).<br/><br/>This project aims to derive a foundational, statistical theory of privacy that builds upon and contributes to modern theoretical advances in information theory and machine learning. The statistical nature of inference (both for legitimate and illegitimate ends) requires a statistical approach to measuring and ensuring privacy and utility. A significant novel element derived from this view is the maximal alpha leakage, a new, tunable measure for information leakage which quantifies the ability of an adversary to learn any function of private data via a parametric class of loss functions. This tunable measure is derived from a rich information-theoretic framework based on Renyi divergence, thereby uniting disparate existing measures under a single framework. Moreover, its operational significance and computational flexibility allow for natural application in machine learning. In the context of these measures, this project studies privacy-utility tradeoffs both theoretically and in a data-driven manner in two distinct settings: (i) releasing datasets in a similar form as the original, with privacy and strict utility guarantees for arbitrary statistical analysis, and (ii) releasing privacy-guaranteed data representations for specific learning tasks. Broader dissemination of the work will go beyond conferences to organizing a privacy workshop in the latter half of the project to enable inter-disciplinary interactions and application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of this energy is used to overcome drag forces produced by the turbulent flow of gases and liquids; only a modest reduction in drag would result in large fuel savings.  Drag is associated with turbulent flow creating regions of concentrated vorticity near walls.  Previous methods for reducing the drag forces, such as introducing substances (such as polymers) into the flow, did not exploit the known structure of the turbulence in a targeted way. When polymers are injected or bled into the near-wall turbulent boundary layer, they become distributed randomly, making it impractical in most cases to use these additives to reduce drag.   This work seeks to answer: Can micro-particles containing a suitable additive and having specific physical properties be introduced into turbulent flow to achieve much greater drag reduction than traditional methods? The success of the present approach in reducing drag is expected to motivate the emergence of technologies focused on the development of micro-particles that can detect the nature of their own flow environment and respond by modifying that environment. For example, particles which segregate themselves into turbulent structures based on their density and subsequently dissolve will be examined first, but future smart particles might sense local flow properties, such as flow stain rates, and subsequently direct themselves to regions of the flow where their effects may be most impactful. It is easy to imagine how reducing drag on ships, cars, trains, and airplanes would have a broad impact on society.<br/><br/>The proposed work aims to specifically target these structures by allowing particles, smaller than the smallest turbulent length scale and of the appropriate shape or density, to carry and release drag reducing agents as they collect in a natural way within or around such structures. Ideally, as one such structure is disrupted, remaining particles will migrate to the next in a disruptive cascade. Particle properties (especially particle sizes, densities, polymer properties, polymer release mechanisms, particle injection locations, and injection rates) and smart injection techniques that are most effective in reducing drag will be determined. It is proposed to study this concept using direct numerical simulation of the Navier Stokes equations (which describe fluid motion) for the transitional case of turbulent spot evolution and for the fully turbulent flat plate boundary layer and channel flow cases. These situations cover the canonical transitional and turbulence internal and external flow regimes relevant to flow about ships as well as within pipelines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PUI faculty focus predominantly on undergraduate education and research, making significant contributions to science by generating knowledge in their fields while mentoring future researchers.  PUIs are critical incubators of the next generation of scientists; students who attend institutions with a focus on undergraduate teaching and research are more likely to remain in a STEM major, compared to those at institutions with a greater emphasis on graduate programs.  For underrepresented minority students, training programs that include combinations of research experience and mentorship have broadened participation in the STEM disciplines.  However, scientists entering faculty careers at PUIs face a difficult transition from a research-intensive environment to a heavy teaching load, typically with the expectation of mentoring undergraduate research; limited funding; and few colleagues with similar research interests.  ASPB and the Plant Biology conference provide important resources for plant biologists at PUIs to maintain connections with the broader scientific community.  Although it is the travel awardees and those who attend the workshop and panel who will receive the most direct support from this funding, this professional development opportunity will provide far-reaching benefits to their undergraduate researchers, ASPB, and the federal agencies that support PUI research.<br/><br/>Grant funding will support greater PUI faculty participation at Plant Biology 2019 through competitive travel grants and PUI-specific programing, including a career panel, half-day workshop, and section meeting.  Despite 1/3 of PhD students and postdocs expressing a strong interest in PUI careers, scant attention is paid to mentoring pre- and early career PUI faculty, especially those from underrepresented minorities, toward establishing academic independence. The PUI career panel at Plant Biology 2019 addresses requests from graduate students and postdocs for information about career paths and opportunities at PUIs. Those attending the panel will have the opportunity to enter into one-on-one partnerships with experienced PUI faculty who will help those preparing for or beginning a PUI career.  In addition, colleagues at R1 institutions will learn how to best support and advise graduate students and postdocs in their labs who are applying to PUI faculty positions.  A specific challenge for faculty at PUI institutions is taking research conducted by multiple undergraduates (who are often involved with a project for a short duration), and piecing that work together into ""publishable units"". The PUI workshop will focus on designing undergraduate research projects with publication in mind and navigating the writing and publication process once the research is completed.  Workshop participants will leave better equipped to take the knowledge generated in their labs and disseminate it through publications in their field.  This will not only benefit those faculty members and their students, but also increase the rate and extent of dissemination of scientific knowledge.

Magnetic and ferroelectric materials are particularly appealing because they enable data to be stored and manipulated, and unlike conventional semiconductor devices, the information is preserved even without power. This research is developing new composite oxide materials with precisely tailored structures on the nanoscale and attractive magnetic, optical and electronic properties that could be used in applications such as new types of microelectronic memory or logic devices, or filtration membranes with designed porosity. Graduate students are being trained in interdisciplinary science and engineering fields including materials design, measurement, and modeling, which prepares them for employment in the high-tech sector. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The route to enhanced functionality in electronic and magnetic devices occurs through the use of new materials and structures, and oxide materials in particular exhibit a wide range of highly tunable magnetic, optical and electronic properties. In this research, oxide nanostructures are being created by self-assembly, consisting of two different materials with precisely engineered nanoscale geometries. The properties of the nanocomposites differ qualitatively from those of the individual bulk materials due to coupling of the two phases at the interfaces and can be tuned via the composition, crystal structure, size, shape and interface geometry of the two phases. Through appropriate materials selection and design, these nanocomposites can display exciting properties including high conduction at interfaces, enhanced ferroelectricity and magnetoelectric coupling that are either absent or difficult to modulate in single-phase materials. The overall goal of the research is to develop strategies to synthesize ceramic nanocomposites by design, in which the morphology and 3D arrangement of the two phases can be controlled, their properties are explored, and device applications and manufacturing strategies (including growth methods compatible with semiconductor fabrication) are developed. These materials may be used in applications such as new types of microelectronic memory or logic devices, or filtration membranes with designed porosity. The research is training students in interdisciplinary STEM fields that span thin film processing, materials characterization, and modeling of structure, strain and electronic properties. Within this project, online educational materials are being developed and public outreach is being conducted through an activity called the NanoObservatory, in which lithography and microscopy are demonstrated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will result in algorithms for <br/>shrinking the cost of large-scale in-memory data processing. The key lessons <br/>learned from this project will be integrated into the graduate-level course <br/>on database systems at Georgia Tech, educating students about the challenges <br/>and opportunities in non-volatile memory database systems.<br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into three interacting research <br/>thrusts. The first thrust develops a taxonomy of data migration policies for <br/>volatile and non-volatile memory technologies. What makes this different than <br/>earlier attempts is that the buffer manager will dynamically leverage all the <br/>data flow paths enabled by non-volatile memory to improve the database system's <br/>performance. The second thrust develops a machine-learning model for <br/>automatically tuning the data migration policy for an arbitrary workload and <br/>storage hierarchy. Due to the unique price, capacity, and performance <br/>characteristics of non-volatile memory, it will be challenging for database <br/>administrators to size the different levels of a multi-tier storage hierarchy. <br/>The third thrust develops a storage system recommender to help administrators <br/>identify the optimal hierarchy for their target workloads.

Due to the recent proliferation of large public neuroimaging data repositories, researchers have access to an unprecedented amount of data, but in many ways the amount of data has surpassed our abilities to analyze it. With pressing health questions attracting the interest of scientists, clinicians, and engineers, we have an urgent need for computational tools that integrate the methods and expertise of different fields. This project seeks to advance the analysis of big brain data by developing, using, and sharing novel open-source computational tools for the modeling and analysis of cortical thickness, an indicator of healthy brain development. Through the analysis of two large data sets containing over 500 individual scans, a baseline for cortical thickness variation throughout healthy development will be generated. Numerical simulations will also shed light on the effect of the mechanical forces that give rise to the brain?s unique shape. The computational tools developed will be made available for use by other researchers to further leverage existing open access databases of MRI scans. Beyond that, this project has the potential to produce new insights with clinical applications in the analysis of neurological disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. Alongside this trans-disciplinary project, the team will also develop a student-written blog, intended for the general public, on interesting investigations in the field of biomechanics.<br/><br/>Gyrification, or the process by which the brain develops its characteristic wrinkles and folds, is the result of both biological processes and mechanical forces. These elements, tightly coupled and affecting each other, affect both the form and function of the brain. This project will increase the biological fidelity of the finite element simulations used to model gyrification by representing cerebrospinal fluid pressure, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic pruning through the development of new material models that describe heterogeneous, anisotropic, growing and remodeling tissue. These computational simulations will generate a deeper understanding of the role of mechanical forces in the evolution of cortical thickness, which varies regionally both within and between individuals. By introducing a new metric of interest that allows for the characterization of thickness variations on arbitrarily small regions, this project will develop new computational tools for the analysis of within-subject and between-subject variations of cortical thickness and the characterization of these patterns in healthy development. The successful completion of this research will result in novel computational tools for neurological imaging analysis of big brain data in the many public neuroimaging databases, generating additional value out of existing resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The learned human preferences are an important element in planning for interactive autonomous systems, e.g., robots collaborating with different types of human teammates, or shared autonomy with a human to efficiently teleoperate a robot arm. One hopes that learning techniques can be used to learn reward functions representing humans' preferences for robotics applications. However, a significant part of the success of learning algorithms can be attributed to the availability of large amounts of labeled data. Unfortunately, collecting and labeling data can be costly and time-consuming in robotics applications. In addition, humans are not always capable of reliably assigning a success value (reward) to a given robot action, and their demonstrations are usually suboptimal due to the difficulty of operating robots with more than a few degrees of freedom. The proposed research develops foundational techniques to address the key challenges of using learning techniques in human-robot interaction. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop efficient methods and algorithms to first better model and understand humans preferences while operating, interacting, and collaborating with robots. Furthermore, the investigator will design algorithms that plan for robots that are aware of such preferences and can initiate a safe and seamless interaction with humans. This project involves two main contributions: (1) Developing efficient and active algorithms to learn probabilistic mixture models for humans preferences about how a robot should operate based on comparisons and rankings., and (2) Developing planning algorithms for robots that leverage humans preferences to enable seamless shared autonomy and more efficient human-robot interaction. Preliminary results in the domain of autonomous driving suggest that one can learn driving preferences of humans and this approach can improve efficiency and safety of robotics systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A better understanding of turbulence in the lower atmosphere is the prerequisite for better quantification and modeling of these scalar fluxes. Over the past few decades, there has been active research on the topology and transporting capacity of coherent structures in canonical turbulent boundary layers and convective systems. However, problems of practical relevance in micrometeorology have not profited from these studies. This project aims to fill the research gap by investigating the role of coherent structures in scalar transport in atmospheric boundary layer flows over heterogeneous landscapes. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the interactions between land surface heterogeneity and coherent structures at the point- and landscape- scales, and their implications for the breakdown of Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) in describing scalar fluxes. At the point-scale, the breakdown of MOST arises from advective terms communicating the signatures of land surface heterogeneity and vertical transport terms bearing the signatures of coherent structures. At the landscape-scale where a spatial averaging is conducted, dispersive fluxes arise from the interactions between land surface heterogeneity and coherent structures. This work combines field experiments and large-eddy simulations (LES) under a unifying framework via flux budget equations and their spatially-averaged version. <br/><br/>The field experiment will be conducted over a relatively flat but heterogeneous terrain in Idaho Falls, Idaho, with a 62-m tower and several short towers to be equipped with eddy covariance systems, a sodar, a wind profiler with RASS, 35 mesonet stations, and other instruments. The field work will provide a unique characterization of coherent structures and scalar turbulence in three dimensions and at high resolutions. It will allow quantification of horizontal and vertical terms in the scalar flux budget simultaneously. A series of LES runs will be used to extend the insights afforded by the field experiment from point to landscape scales. A novel approach based on quadrant analysis in time and space will be employed to model dispersive fluxes. The new datasets generated by the field experiment will provide opportunities for exploring other topics related to atmospheric boundary layer and land surface processes. Beyond the tutoring of two graduate students and two undergraduate students, the project will involve several educational and outreach components. It will generate mini-projects for students in several graduate and undergraduate courses taught by the PIs on boundary layer meteorology, applied meteorology, and fluid dynamics. Short films and videos will be created to present the significance of the findings to researchers and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While this aggregated data can have tremendous benefit for consumers and data scientists via technologies built on machine learning and artificial intelligence, this benefit must be tempered with meaningful assurances of privacy for the very people who provided the data in the first place. This project adopts a rigorous information-theoretic approach to give meaningful privacy guarantees while still providing statistical utility. By combining theoretical and data-driven research, this project can inform public policy as well as best-practices for industry. The overall goal is to provide any data scientist with a set of tools to guarantee meaningful privacy in practice. To do so, this project explores meaningful measures of privacy leakage in the learning context, characterizes the fundamental tradeoffs between privacy and utility, develops techniques to ensure privacy in realistic settings, and tests these algorithms on publicly available datasets. The project is also committed to broadening participation in computing via two outreach efforts: (i) interactive demonstrations of privacy issues that stem from using social media to middle and high school students via ASU's annual STEM event, Open Door, and (ii) teaching modules on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), and short courses (""data jams"") at ASU via the Young Engineers Shape the World (YESW) summer program and at Harvard; these modules, targeted at female, financially disadvantaged, and Latino and Hispanic students, aim to make a meaningful contribution to increasing a diverse STEM workforce by providing students hands-on experience on basic concepts of coding, manipulating datasets, and producing simple visualizations collectively. Outreach efforts will be evaluated using well understood metrics for assessment of student interest, engagement, and knowledge via ASU?s College Research and Evaluation Services Team (CREST).<br/><br/>This project aims to derive a foundational, statistical theory of privacy that builds upon and contributes to modern theoretical advances in information theory and machine learning. The statistical nature of inference (both for legitimate and illegitimate ends) requires a statistical approach to measuring and ensuring privacy and utility. A significant novel element derived from this view is the maximal alpha leakage, a new, tunable measure for information leakage which quantifies the ability of an adversary to learn any function of private data via a parametric class of loss functions. This tunable measure is derived from a rich information-theoretic framework based on Renyi divergence, thereby uniting disparate existing measures under a single framework. Moreover, its operational significance and computational flexibility allow for natural application in machine learning. In the context of these measures, this project studies privacy-utility tradeoffs both theoretically and in a data-driven manner in two distinct settings: (i) releasing datasets in a similar form as the original, with privacy and strict utility guarantees for arbitrary statistical analysis, and (ii) releasing privacy-guaranteed data representations for specific learning tasks. Broader dissemination of the work will go beyond conferences to organizing a privacy workshop in the latter half of the project to enable inter-disciplinary interactions and application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thompson from the University of Southern California to develop green and energy efficient methods to produce semiconducting polymers.  This existing class of plastic-electronic materials has shown great promise for use in organic solar cells and light emitting diodes, as well as several sensory applications in which light is converted to electrical current.  In this work, semiconducting polymers are prepared using catalysts based on inexpensive and abundant elements such as copper and nickel.   These metals are utilized to lower the energy barrier associated with polymerization processes, making it easier to convert starting materials to desired products.  Consequently, their use improves the sustainability of semiconducting polymers and enables new reactivity and properties in the polymers.  The new processes associated with this award provide means to assemble the repeating monomer units along main polymer chains in several different ways giving rise not only to linear chains composed of identical repeating units, but also chains in which those repeating units are different and arranged in controlled and predictable ways.  Consequently, access to such advanced architectures in these polymers could lead to improvements in their applications, specifically the efficiency by which they convert sunlight into electricity.  The work enables outstanding training for undergraduate and graduate students in polymer chemistry, extending to students hosted at the University of Southern California from Cerritos Community College.  The broad impact through the development of a graduate student exchange program with Ludwig Maximillians University in Munich, Germany is very important for helping to expose students to the broader scope of international research and collaboration. <br/><br/>This research is focused on the development of alternative synthetic routes to direct arylation polymerization catalyzed by copper and nickel complexes for the synthesis of conjugated, semiconducting polymers.  Special emphasis is also placed on the use of green and environmentally friendly solvents.  The capabilities of direct arylation polymerization are extended by focusing toward a transition from step-growth to chain-growth, which enables access to more advanced architectures such as block and gradient copolymers.  Studies related to the ability of direct arylation polymerization to effect controlled living polymerization are a significant step forward in this area of research because it would enable control over the molecular weight and polymer polydispersity.  An additional direction involves exploration of more sustainable oxidants for the related dehydrogenative polymerization process that avoids monomer halogenation and the use of stoichiometric amounts of silver oxidants.  The use of earth-abundant copper and nickel catalysts to access conjugated polymers via this work is important and has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and complexity of existing procedures for conjugated polymer synthesis, which are generally not atom efficient, require harsh reaction conditions, toxic solvents, and create significant amounts of waste products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will determine how to tune nanomaterial properties to allow them to cross the leaf surface, enter leaf tissues, and co-locate with selected target locations in the leaf. The ability to deliver nanomaterials into plants at the required rate, location, and dose for mitigating crop stresses will lead to a paradigm shift in the way society manages agriculture to sustainably meet the demands of a growing population.

For example, increased stiffness will increase wavelength. Stiffness and viscosity can depend on both location and direction. A material with aligned fibers or layers may have different stiffness and viscosity values along the fibers or layers versus across them. Converting wave measurements into a mechanical property map or image is known as reconstruction. Reconstruction in isotropic materials, with the same mechanical properties regardless of direction, is easier than in anisotropic materials, whose properties vary with direction. Transformation Elastography is based on the idea of distorting the material as part of the reconstruction algorithm to make the anisotropic problem become isotropic. This strategy, which has been shown to work in simple two-dimensional reconstruction problems, will be extended to more complex three-dimensional problems. Elastography is a potentially transformative measurement technology for basic research into material mechanics. Extending it to anisotropic materials is essential to advance its application in geophysical exploration, fiber composite analysis, and medical diagnosis of diseases of the brain, skeletal muscle, heart and other organs with aligned fibers for which changes in stiffness and viscosity have been proven to correlate with disease. This research supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health. Research developments will be integrated into courses and multimedia educational materials for a diverse group of students at multiple levels, from K-12 through graduate level engineering.<br/><br/>Elastography relies on a constitutive model of mechanical wave motion in the viscoelastic material to interpret the noninvasive measurements. To make the modeling problem analytically tractable, isotropy and homogeneity are often assumed, and the effects of finite boundaries are ignored. But, infinite isotropic homogeneity is not the situation in most cases of interest, when there are pathological conditions, material faults or hidden anomalies that are not uniformly distributed in fibrous or layered structures of finite dimension. Introduction of anisotropy, inhomogeneity and finite boundaries complicates the analysis forcing the abandonment of analytically-driven strategies, in favor of numerical approximations that are computationally expensive and yield less physical insight. A new strategy, Transformation Elastography, is planned that involves spatial distortion in order to make an anisotropic problem become isotropic. Development and experimental validation of this new strategy requires inverting the algorithm and extending initial developments from two- to three-dimensional problems with inhomogeneity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While initial progress has been made in the basic qualitative understanding of both, there is a lack of a quantitative and unified understanding that bridges the two phenomena. In this context, this award supports a research collaboration on the theoretical and experimental analysis of how fracture nucleates, propagates, and possibly self-heals in elastomers subjected to arbitrarily large deformations. In addition to addressing a fundamental scientific question that has remained open for decades, the knowledge sought by this research is essential for the advancement of a broad range of technologies and medical prognoses. For instance, the results from this project will provide direct insight into: the failure of tires, the design of stronger adhesives, the rupture of aneurisms, the design of cartilage, modeling of wound healing, etc. Additionally, this project will train two graduate students for careers in academia or industry and will integrate research results in the undergraduate and graduate curricula at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Texas at Austin. The PIs will also carry out activities to promote interest in high school students to pursue higher education and careers in STEM programs, especially in the field of mechanics, through the creation of lesson modules and laboratory demonstrations.<br/> <br/>The main objective of this project is two-fold: i) to carry out experiments at high spatiotemporal resolution that produce quantitative measurements concerning internal fracture nucleation and propagation, as well as healing, in three elastomers of practical significance, and ii) to construct and numerically implement a continuum theory that, with direct guidance from the experiments, describes, explains, and predicts the nucleation and propagation of fracture, and healing in elastomers undergoing arbitrarily large viscoelastic deformations. The experimental component entails the development of new experiments that will leverage the use of optical microscopy and high-speed imaging in order to capture and measure the evolution of the various underlying processes at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of 1 micron and 200 microseconds. On the other hand, the theoretical component involves a novel mathematical formulation, and associated numerical implementation, that views fracture and healing in a unified manner as a phase transition and that allows, by design, for the accounting of the various underlying mechanisms (storage of energy by elastic deformation and dissipation of energy by viscous deformation and the creation of new surfaces) in a clear, natural, and theoretically consistent manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California, having led to over 100 fatalities and caused more than $3.5 billion in damages. There is a great deficit in our understanding of how fundamental atmospheric processes and their interactions with complex terrain and fire heat can produce a rapid spread of wildfire over downslope regions of complex terrain, such as those in the southwest U.S. As a result, it remains challenging to forecast, even a few hours in advance, the gusty, extremely dry wind surges responsible for rapid fire spread over downslope regions.  New findings from the project could be used to improve the representations of the atmospheric environmental conditions for fire weather forecasts by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the National Weather Service. Improved fire weather forecasts have the potential to increase public safety and reduce loss of life and property. <br/><br/>The research results derived from this project will enhance the contents of graduate and undergraduate courses. The project will educate and train graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina A&T State University (NCAT), one of very few Historically Black Colleges and Universities conducting atmospheric science research. In addition, NCAT investigators plan to visit and present results to high-school teachers and students to broaden their Earth and environmental science knowledge as well as to recruit students into meteorology. A research and education network will be built up among the NCAT, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, USFS, and Argonne National Laboratory.  <br/><br/>In the research project, four historic and devastating wildfires that occurred in northern, central and southern California and central Arizona, as well as several significant fire events observed under real-world settings (major scientific field experiments), will be studied extensively. The research approach will involve simulating the complex interactions among the atmosphere, terrain, and the fire itself with state-of-art convection-permitting mesoscale computer models. For the field experiment case studies, very high-resolution sensors will provide observational data on the fire-atmosphere interactions for comparison with the model simulations. These simulation and observational techniques will enable the research team to diagnose how weather systems interact with the terrain and produce very gusty winds that in turn create a favorable environment for wildfire spread in communities on the edge of major developed regions of the southwestern U.S. The computer models allow the fire and winds to interact and will enable the study of atmospheric motions that contribute to the intensification and spread of these devastating wildfires. This will lead to better predictions of fire intensity and motion in future wildfire events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These communities often lack the financial, technical, and human resources to adequately address those threats. Small to mid-sized urban centers are much more common than the megacities that receive more attention, and cumulatively serve as home for more people. In addition, rural America depends upon small urban centers to drive the rural economy and meet important basic needs such as health services. A workshop is proposed with an overarching goal to conceptualize the sustainability challenges that face the many urban centers that serve as the backbone of rural communities. Additionally, this workshop will focus on urban centers in arid and semi-arid regions where water of adequate quality and quantity is a defining environmental need. The conceptual framework of the workshop is that of ""One Health"", which posits that environmental, human, and wildlife health are closely intertwined, and the path to a sustainable future requires meeting human, economic, and environmental needs. The proposed workshop, scheduled for August 14-16, 2019, in Lubbock, TX, will engage researchers and other stakeholders from communities in the arid southwest to identify the needs of these communities and a path for research to meet those needs.  Knowledge gained through the workshop can be applied to communities facing similar challenges.   <br/><br/>An important goal of the workshop is to build a foundation for a global Sustainable Urban Systems Research Network that can formulate a coordinated and convergent international research agenda to address the needs of small- to mid-size urban communities.  This workshop is an opportunity to engage researchers, students, and stakeholders in identifying the requirements of and a path for research to meet those community needs. This workshop will bring together a multidisciplinary team of academics, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to identify challenges these communities face and potential research avenues to develop solutions for these challenges. The workshop also seeks to more effectively engage Native American and minority communities in the definition and conduct of research directed toward addressing the challenges faced by their communities. These sustainability challenges will be evaluated in each of the four workshop themes: Environmental Sustainability, Urban Design, Water, and Public Health. The Environmental Sustainability theme is focused on the problems of urban development in sync with the natural environment. The urban design theme, while complimenting the Environmental Sustainability theme, is more focused on how the design of the built environment respects the natural environment while meeting the needs for human habitat. The Water theme focuses on the common challenge that all arid regions face in meeting the water needs of the environment, human potable water needs, and water for the competing forces of agriculture, manufacturing, and energy development. The Public Health theme recognizes that the population in small cities and surrounding areas do not have easy access to health care, particularly mental health care, common in large cities. The four themes are each individually important, but all intersect in key ways that need to be explored in the contexts of long-term environmental sustainability and integration with the surrounding rural matrix.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by building capacity to develop a CS endorsement program that can provide teachers with formal CS teaching credentials. Recognizing the importance of computer skills to prepare students for career opportunities, Chicago Public Schools, a project partner, has developed an ambitious Computer Science for All (CS4All) initiative. CS4All requires that all students in Chicago Public Schools complete a year-long CS course as a high school graduation requirement.  Currently, it is estimated that 75% of CS instructors are teaching out-of-subject.  As a result, Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third largest school district, does not have enough qualified CS teachers to meet the CS4All goals.  DePaul University, which has two of the most prominent CS and education programs in the state of Illinois, will partner with Chicago Public Schools to enable the school system to meet the pressing need for qualified CS teachers.  In an increasingly technological, computer-driven world, the United States needs more people who enter the workforce with the skills needed for twenty-first century careers.  This project expects to contribute to filling this need by ensuring that high school graduates from Chicago Public Schools have the foundational computer science skills that will prepare them for these careers.<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to establish the infrastructure for a computer science program that has the potential to prepare hundreds of teachers. Those teachers, in turn, will work with thousands of students in Chicago Public Schools and those students will graduate from high school better prepared for college and with the tools necessary for twenty-first century careers.  To accomplish these goals, this project will work to develop a CS teacher endorsement program at DePaul University that will prepare teachers with formal CS qualifications to educate students in Chicago Public Schools. CS officials at Chicago Public Schools will partner with Education and CS faculty at DePaul to develop the courses and overall framework for the endorsement program. To inform this effort, project personnel will conduct online and face-to-face interviews with DePaul students and CS professionals in the Chicago area to determine critical components that must be included in a state-of-the-art CS curriculum. Project personnel will also obtain input about the needs of students from Chicago Public School teachers who, despite the barriers, have obtained a CS endorsement.  With its established online learning infrastructure, DePaul will investigate the possibility of developing an online curriculum, that could increase access to the endorsement program by removing the barrier of commuting to campus.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.  It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conversion of coal and biomass into useful fuel, thermal storage by particulate material, and particle-based solar receivers, all represent promising technologies that rely heavily on heat transfer in multiphase systems. Current tools used in industry and academia rely on simplistic models for average reaction rates as well as heat transfer coefficients that are known to vary by several orders of magnitude. This project introduces a new modeling approach that will enable researchers to address the huge range of challenges associated with heat transfer through gas-particle mixtures. For a broader educational impact, a toy version of a fluidized bed will be built with beads sprayed with thermochromic liquid crystals that change color with temperature. This will be presented at local schools to illustrate fundamental concepts of fluid-particle interactions.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers from Michigan, Iowa State, and Minnesota collaborate to develop a new paradigm in multiphase heat transfer modeling. The aim is to bridge the gap between particle-scale thermal processes and device-scale predictions. A consistent modeling framework is formulated that scales from a well-accepted physics-based model to a larger scale of interest. Current approaches typically ensemble-average data obtained from the microscale physics directly, without taking into account local variations on scales resolvable by the simulation framework. The proposed effort will connect the spatially-averaged, large-scale representation to two-phase statistics obtained from particle-resolved numerical simulations. A previously overlooked ergodic consistency requirement will be enforced so that the numerical solution converges to the ensemble-averaged two-fluid equations in the limit of large filter width. Model validation will be based on simultaneous multi-camera imaging at different scales, and a novel application of Voronoi tessellation to quantify clustering in dense suspensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this unanticipated, stressful situation, parents must quickly absorb complicated clinical information and take on new caregiving tasks, without abandoning other responsibilities. Furthermore, within-family communication and coping strategies of the parents, or dyad, are significant predictors of post-hospitalization health outcomes. Human-Computer Interaction and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work researchers are actively studying how technology can support coordination between children and their care team, and between parents and children. However, little research has focused on how technology can support and augment the parenting dyad during hospitalization.

The specific objective of this proposal is to identify and demonstrate how social technologies can support and augment the ability of parenting dyads to effectively communicate and coordinate during hospitalization.  Through a combination of rigorous qualitative investigations, parent-driven design sessions, and hospital-based pilot technology deployments, the investigator will address two specific aims: 1) Characterize current communication and coordination practices within parenting dyads, and 2) Envision, demonstrate, and verify dyadic caregiving support technologies.

This reproductive isolation prevents interbreeding, allowing for the emergence of distinct species. This research project makes use of the tremendous species diversity present in the monkey flowers (Mimulus). Comparison of many pairs of species in this group will uncover the genetic changes responsible for and the evolutionary forces at work that generated reproductive isolation. Understanding the interactions between genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes that lead to species diversification will also contribute to agricultural breeding programs. The project includes efforts to educate grade school and high school students about evolution and the value of species diversity, and train undergraduate and graduate students in evolutionary biology and the molecular genetics of development.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on the evolution of F1 hybrid seed inviability, a relatively unstudied but potentially common reproductive barrier in flowering plants. This project integrates phylogenetic, population genetic, developmental, transcriptomic, and genome mapping approaches to systematically address whether hybrid seed failure is a key isolating mechanism driving population and species diversification across the genus Mimulus. The project will test the hypothesis that this form of reproductive isolation evolves rapidly via natural selection generated by parent-offspring conflict in all outbreeding flowering plant species. Such conflict-driven selection is expected to cause divergent evolution of the genetic control of endosperm development in seeds in different lineages via differential genomic imprinting, quickly leading to strong postzygotic isolation regardless of the ecological environments that the species experience. The main goals of this project are to determine the rate of evolution, strength, and importance of hybrid seed inviability in the speciation process across the genus Mimulus; to assess the developmental mechanisms and transcriptomic signatures of hybrid seed inviability, and finally to determine the genetic basis of hybrid seed inviability and the degree of parallelism in the genetic basis of speciation in this genus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the experimental probes to study these exotic nuclei involve particles that interact strongly themselves, making it difficult to extract the properties of individual protons or neutrons in these exotic systems. This project aims at overcoming this difficulty by providing a simultaneous description of positive energy nucleons, the domain of elastic scattering, and bound nucleons, the domain of nuclear structure, using the framework of the propagator method of quantum mechanics. This approach will provide critical insight into the properties of very neutron-rich nuclei, and is therefore relevant for the physics of neutron stars by clarifying where neutrons are found with respect to the distribution of protons. The PI will mentor graduate students in this research and collaborate with experimental colleagues who will perform related experiments.<br/><br/>The propagator method will be utilized with non-local potentials constrained by experimental data that allow for the accurate description of ground-state properties of nuclei by the method of dispersion relations. Simultaneously, this implementation will be able to describe or predict all relevant experimental data in the continuum including elastic scattering cross sections. It will therefore be possible to study various nuclear reactions using the ingredients of this method in analogy to the successful analysis of electron-induced proton knockout reactions, thereby clarifying the properties of protons and neutrons in exotic nuclei as well as suggesting relevant new experiments. In particular, the prediction of the neutron distribution for nuclei with excess neutrons will be of critical importance for experiments at Jefferson Lab and future experiments at FRIB. The propagator method will also be employed to calculate the properties of nuclei by starting from the underlying interactions between nucleons as constrained by the symmetries of the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons, Quantum Chromo Dynamics, and the available data for the properties of two nucleons. Such calculations will be applied with a new scheme that allows the ab initio calculation of properties of heavier nuclei that have not been studied in this way to date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Marrying mass communications research with human-centered computing, this research will take a novel interdisciplinary approach to answer the following questions. How can online information platforms effectively embrace the ideal of transparency as a means to increase trust? How can news organizations effectively demonstrate to the public the primary features that make a story trustworthy and the core aspects that govern the production and reporting of a news story?<br/> <br/>The research will be conducted along three phases.

In the second phase, this project will appropriate theories from Communications research and combine with data mining and natural language-based techniques from the Computing field, to build transparency features highlighting key aspects of news reporting. Specifically, it will explore two classes of transparency tools: disclosure and participatory. Disclosure transparency will communicate the production, framing, and journalistic standards around news reports. Participatory transparency will aim at getting users involved in the news cycle through two channel-based interactive features: commenting capability and hovering to see additional information.

By optimizing and utilizing internal dynamic ionic processes in the memristors, the artificial network can be directly driven by the spike trains from biological neurons without amplification or other pre-processing, where responses from the memristor network can be used to analyze temporal patterns in the neuron spikes and to connect detected neuronal activity with functions of the biological networks. The tightly coupled memristor network with the biological network can further allow functions in the biological system to be directly mapped on the electrical system, and potentially lead to future neural prosthesis and augmentation applications.

Tufts professor Allan Cormack provided the mathematical foundations of X-ray computed tomography, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979 for this work. This international conference will honor his achievements and expand on his legacy by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate current research challenges and to inspire new lines of inquiry. Image reconstruction plays a crucial role in many aspects of human life such as healthcare, national security, non-destructive testing, and geophysical exploration - all of which will be represented at this conference. Image reconstruction involves the determination of features of an object based on some measured or observed data from the exterior of the object. The measurements are acquired using data from X-rays, pressure waves, sound waves, electric current, etc. The recovery of the object from this data is known as an inverse problem, which is solved using either analytic reconstruction formulas or iterative methods. The conference is structured to provide cross-fertilization between fields and to provide opportunities for senior and junior researchers to interact. This will be promoted at several levels: between subject areas; between prominent and younger researchers; and with a very strong emphasis on discussions between graduate students and established researchers. Graduate students and those new to the field will be encouraged to participate in a poster session in which they will present their research. Diverse groups of faculty and students will be recruited through broad advertising. Results are planned to be disseminated in a special issue of one of the premier journals in the field of inverse problems and, when possible, talks will be posted on the conference website https://math.tufts.edu/faculty/equinto/Cormack2019/.<br/><br/>A large portion of the conference will involve the following topics: X-ray, optical, photo-acoustic, multi-energy, Compton, and multi-spectral tomography.

Murray and J. von Neumann as a mathematical tool to understand particle physics. Subsequently, it became an independent discipline that has stimulated the development of powerful mathematical theories and bringing valuable insight to physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell phone network design). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary in nature as they arise canonically from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time their study remained closely connected with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently geometric group theory. This project investigates several major open problems inspired by the rich interaction between operator algebras and the aforementioned fields.<br/><br/>This research project explores new horizons in the classification of group von Neumann algebras. The first objective of the project is to advance Connes' rigidity conjecture, a major wide-open problem predicting that ICC property (T) groups are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras (W*-superrigid). The PIs proposed several natural constructions of W*-superrigid property (T) groups based on new developments in geometric group theory and deformation/rigidity theory. The second objective of the project revolves around the study of prime II1 factors. The main focus is to understand the relationship between various manifestations of negative curvature in group theory and primeness aspects of the corresponding group factor.

The main mathematical tool to model such multi-scale dynamical systems involving stochasticity is through partial differential equations (PDE) with rough random coefficients.

Most catalyst research focuses on discovering combinations of materials that are optimal for accelerating the targeted reaction.   Fundamental limitations exist, however, regarding the extent to which materials alone can accelerate reactions.  The study will side-step such materials limitations by introducing dynamic perturbations to the catalyst's operating conditions at the timescale of reaction events.  The radically new concept will be demonstrated on the water splitting reaction - an important reaction for generating hydrogen by renewable means.  Preliminary theoretical analysis has suggested that reaction rates can be increased by orders of magnitude via the dynamic perturbations, while also opening the door to less expensive catalysts for a wide range of chemical reactions.<br/>  <br/>The catalytic activity of materials is dictated by the binding energetics of key reaction intermediates, described through energy scaling relationships, which predicts a maximum in the catalytic activity - characterized by the well-known Sabatier principle - achievable through only material design. The electrochemical splitting of water to produce renewable hydrogen suffers from this limitation, where rates of hydrogen evolution reactions are dictated by the binding energy of hydrogen. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that optimal hydrogen binding energies are found on precious metal catalysts, placing strain on an already economically challenging process. The study will investigate the extent to which the application of periodic oscillations in applied potential, on the timescale of turnover events, can alter the binding energetics of hydrogen on the electrode surface. Operating catalysts under a constantly oscillating applied potential, where binding energetics of reaction intermediates are constantly changing, allows a single catalyst to mimic the performance of multiple materials in a periodic fashion. This will allow for the design of catalysts that break past the current limitations imposed by scaling relationships, to reach unprecedented levels of catalytic activity. Implementing this transformative method of operation is currently limited by our experimental ability to alter binding energetics on catalytic materials with precision under reaction conditions.  Specifically, the project will explore the use of alternating potentials in standard electrochemical cells for efficient water splitting. This experimental design will also be used to investigate coupling thermocatalysis with electrochemical systems that serve as a binding energy modulation platform.  The approach is potentially applicable to a broad range of catalytic reactions of commercial and environmental importance.  The dynamic catalysis concept will also be introduced to graduate students via an elective course developed by the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This field shows great promise of basic science research for a variety of reasons. It is known that normal universal matters are made of four states: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. The generation of THz wave from solids, gases, and plasmas has been demonstrated, used, and understood for decades. To generate THz waves from liquid water has long been considered as impossible in THz community. This is a scientific curiosity: why can only three states in matter: solid, gas and plasma, be used to generate THz waves, but not liquid Among liquids, including water, is it just due to the large absorption coefficient in THz frequency range. The THz liquid photonics could be one of the key projects to place the remaining piece to the missing puzzle. It is reasonable to expect that liquids might have unique properties if they could be harnessed as THz sources. Liquids have a high molecular density, close to that of solids, meaning that light over a certain area will interact with many more molecules than an equivalent cross-section of gases. This makes liquids very good candidates for the study of high-energy-density plasma. A successful investigation in THz generation from liquids might complete the last piece of the matter-phase puzzle for THz sources in the matter temperature-pressure phase diagram in THz community.  <br/><br/>The technical description of the project <br/>Our proposed scientific investigation of THz liquid photonics focuses on THz generation from carefully selected liquids by using femtosecond laser induced micro-plasma. Compared with ambient air in THz air photonics, liquids have much lower ionization energy (for example, only 6.5 eV for water), but 3 orders higher molecular density, which means more charged particles can be provided in the same ionized volume. Compared with solid crystals, phase matching conditions and crystal phonon absorptions are avoided in the generation process, which significantly limit the bandwidth of the THz pulse generated from solid sources. Additionally, the breakdown in liquids is not a permanent damage, which will be naturally erased through electron-ion recombination. Liquid fluidity can also provide a fresh interaction area for the next pulse. All these superiorities make liquids a promising THz source. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the mechanism of the THz wave generation from water. A variety of liquids with different absorption coefficient (polarity), molecular density, photo-ionization threshold, and viscosity will be investigated. We will conduct a study of THz photonics in liquids by using laser induced micro-plasma. Specially we propose to perform systematic study of the generation of broadband THz waves in liquids, include aqueous solutions (normal and heavy water, salty water, sugar water, alcohol solution), and over 20 different liquids (with different polarity and pH levels). Double optical pulse excitation method of THz wave generation will be used. We will test different liquid solutions, from water film and line to droplet and mist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The simultaneous occurrence of convective clouds over a large region can sometimes be explained in terms of external factors, such as continental heating or surface wind convergence driven by sea surface temperature (SST) contrasts. But perhaps convection can also aggregate spontaneously: not because external factors favor it, but because convection itself creates favorable conditions for additional convection. Such self-aggregation, in which convection begets convection, has been found in idealized simulations of the tropical atmosphere by the PIs and others.<br/><br/>In these simulations self-aggregation is typically temperature dependent, increasing with SSTs, and as convection aggregates skies clear and dry in the non-convecting areas. The loss of energy to space by longwave radiation from the clear-sky regions subsequently cools the SSTs, which reduces aggregation and restores the sea surface to its original temperature. This restorative feedback loop could exert a powerful influence on the temperature of the tropics, acting to reduce both the variability of tropical SSTs and the increase in SSTs due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.<br/><br/>The notion of self-aggregation as a tropical thermostat is intriguing, but so far the effect has been demonstrated and studied primarily in idealized models. Simplifications used in these models include limited geographical domain, uniform SSTs, and periodic lateral boundaries. More work is thus needed to determine if thermal regulation through self-aggregation is a robust effect in the real world. A logical next step in this direction is to look at self-aggregation in more sophisticated models.<br/><br/>Under this award the Principal Investigators (PIs) examine the mechanisms of self-aggregation, and its potency for thermal regulation, in a global cloud resolving model called the System for Atmospheric Modeling. The model, developed by one of the PIs, can simulate the forms of convective aggregation seen in satellite images, including hurricanes and the large-scale Madden-Julian Oscillation. The model allows experiments in which various mechanisms thought to be responsible for aggregation are suppressed by direct intervention. For instance the importance of cloud longwave radiative effects can be assessed by averaging the radiative flux between clear and cloudy areas, thereby suppressing longwave radiation as a mechanism for aggregation. The model also includes a sophisticated representation of cloud microphysics, which enables tests of the sensitivity of aggregation to specific cloud properties. One issue to be addressed is the sensitivity of aggregation to the radiative properties of ice crystals near the tops of the clouds.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the large and populous portion of the earth that would be affected by the self-aggregation thermostat. A better understanding of convective aggregation could also be beneficial for predicting tropical weather, and results of this work could inform the development of forecast models. One area that could benefit is hurricane prediction, as hurricanes form from tropical cloud clusters, and the prediction of hurricane genesis remains a challenge. In addition, the project provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new synthetic methods may be used to make new drugs and agrichemicals.  The research combines laboratory experiments and computer calculations to predict and verify how the reactions progress.  The ultimate goal of this work is to replace expensive metal catalysts with less inexpensive metals that are more effective in convert carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds to carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds.  This research illustrates the detailed pathways for the new chemical reactions.  The research group of Professor Groves trains future scientists, especially women and those that are under-represented in science.  These scientists gain both technical training and mentoring so that they are successful in careers in teaching, research, and industry.<br/><br/>More than 95% of industrially-produced chemicals are derived from a small slate of simple, molecular building blocks.  Chemical manufacturing contributes more than 30% of the GNP of the United States.

Such processes are of fundamental interest as they inpact the economic value of the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and chemical process industries. The development of such novel oxidative processes requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of metal-mediated atom transfer.  The project aims to observe the unitary processes of catalysis by characterizing reactive metal oxo and metal peroxo intermediates and elucidating the nature of their reactions with organic substrates. In particular, the research elaborates a conceptual basis for heteroatom rebound catalysis (HRC), which can be dissected in a manner similar to hydrogen atom transfer. The project integrates small molecule chemical catalysts with insights from metalloenzymes and biocatalytic processes. Through analogies with Nature, the redox chemistry of iron, manganese, cobalt and other metals can add significantly to understanding and increased capabilities in chemical catalysis.

Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.<br/><br/>This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This dust seeds clouds and scatters and absorbs sunlight and, when it settles from our atmosphere, fertilizes ecosystems and darkens snow and ice. Basic physics predicts that coarse dust particles - still no larger than the thickness of a human hair - quickly settle out of the atmosphere. However, measurements indicate that this is not the case; instead, coarse dust can remain in the atmosphere for days and travel thousands of kilometers from its source. This dust therefore has more time to impact the Earth and its weather and climate. This makes it critical to determine the processes that cause dust to stay in the atmosphere longer than expected, and account for these missing processes in climate and weather models.<br/><br/>This project uses Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and other techniques to test three hypotheses of the nature of the process(es) that help keep coarse dust aloft. Specifically, this project tests whether dust asphericity, electrification, and / or turbulence in dusty layers keep dust aloft against the action of gravitational settling. The project will result in a parameterization of dust gravitational settling that includes these missing processes and that can be used in weather and climate models. This will allow these models to more accurately represent desert dust in the atmosphere and its impact on the Earth system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At room temperature, the collisions are random and very difficult to control. By cooling a gas to ultracold temperatures near absolute zero (below minus 273 degrees Celsius) and trapping it in the center of a vacuum chamber, collisions can be controlled and used to develop new technologies such as quantum-limited sensors for impurities. An ultracold gas behaves like a single quantum mechanical object, a matter wave. Collisions still take place in the matter wave, but they now happen in a predictable fashion. In a sodium matter wave, the collisions can be controlled precisely via microwave radiation. The colliding atoms behave like small magnets with magnetic north and south poles determined by the direction of their atomic spin. During collisions, atoms experience each other's magnetic fields and change their spin directions. As they change directions, the atomic spins become correlated with each other at the quantum level, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is useful when atoms are used as sensors. All entangled atoms react to external influences in unison, increasing the sensitivity of a sensor. This research project will use controlled collisions in sodium matter waves to study quantum-enhanced sensing and other quantum technologies.  This project will study the role of impurities and will also explore differences and similarities compared to experiments with entangled beams of light. The research will improve our experimental understanding of quantum technologies based on matter waves under realistic conditions, in the presence of loss and impurities. This has practical applications for development of robust quantum-enhanced sensors, for development of quantum-enhanced probes for ultracold gases, and for improving our understanding of how we can control spin in matter waves at the quantum level.<br/><br/>The goal of this research program is to study a new generation of quantum technologies based on quantum engineering of matter-waves, such as quantum-enhanced sensors for external fields with high spatial resolution, quantum-enhanced probes of ultracold atomic samples to measure spin populations with reduced noise, and quantum-enhanced matter-wave devices such as phase-sensitive amplifiers, similar to those known from quantum optics with light. The control of matter-waves is exerted by microwave-dressing and RF control of spin-exchange collisions in a Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic sodium in the limit of long evolution times. During spin-exchange collisions in the F=1 sodium gas, pairs of atoms with magnetic quantum number m=0 collide and change into pairs with m=+/-1 and vice versa. This process generates quantum entanglement similar to four-wave mixing with light. But there are important differences in the atomic system due to extra terms in the Hamiltonian not present in the photonic system. These differences become increasingly important for long evolution times, t>|h/c|, where t>30 ms in a sodium Bose-Einstein condensate and c is the spin-exchange collisional energy. They give rise to quantum phase transitions that can generate massive entanglement. The ground state depends uniquely on whether the gas is antiferromagnetic (c>0, Na), where it is massively entangled, or ferromagnetic (c<0, Rb), where it is not entangled. The goal of this project is to make use of the unique features of ultracold sodium, and recent technological advances in matter-wave quantum optics, to demonstrate a robust and future-proof platform for matter-wave quantum technologies that will lay the groundwork for extensive long-term research on matter-wave devices similar to photonic devices. This is done by studying the following quantum technologies: a) quantum-enhanced sensing via spin-mixing interferometry in the long evolution time limit, b) quantum-enhanced probing of spin populations, c) quantum state synthesis of exotic many body states, and d) quantum simulation of the effect of impurities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been filled over and replaced with neighborhoods.  Such geomorphic changes increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides.  Similarly, sea level rise and climate-modulated variations in storm characteristics such as intensity, size and track path also alter flood risk.  The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which these geomorphic and climatic changes alter flood risk.  This goal will be met using a combination of computational modeling, historical climate and storm surge data analysis, and theory-based synthesis.  The study will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate and several graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented groups.  It will improve the well-being of communities within urbanized harbors and estuaries by highlighting coastal development practices that can worsen coastal flooding.

Well-known, simplified insights into tidal dynamics will be tested for storm surge, then used to help interpret how altered local topography, bathymetry and wetland area have changed frictional damping and long-wave mechanics.  A combined analysis of climate, storm characteristics, and morphologic change will identify the modes and pathways through which climate variability and bathymetric change modulate storms surges.  Advanced non-stationary univariate and multivariate statistical models will be developed and employed to incorporate these changes and assess how statistical properties relevant for coastal design and risk assessments respond.

Observations will be collected by the NSF/National Center for Atmospheric Research's S-PolKa and Colorado State University's SEA-POL radars, radiosondes, and disdrometers from 25 May to 10 August 2019 during the latter period of the Meiyu season over Taiwan and transition to the early period of the tropical cyclone (TC) season. <br/><br/>The experimental design of PRECIP is motivated by four key factors: 1) a moisture-rich environment, 2) the presence of both complex terrain and an oceanic environment, 3) a dense operational observing network to augment the specialized field observations, and 4) a high frequency of a variety of heavy rainfall events. Taiwan and the western North Pacific region are a natural laboratory that optimizes all four of these criteria. With high total column water vapor in the region as a fundamental precondition, field observations will be used to test hypotheses related to the presence and roles of key ingredients and processes across scales in different heavy rainfall scenarios.  PRECIP will be conducted in collaboration with the Taiwan-area Atmospheric and Hydrological Observation and Prediction Experiment (TAHOPE) and Japanese Tropical cyclones Pacific Asian Research Campaign for Improvement of Intensity estimations/forecasts (T-PARCII) to add additional synergistic research observations to the campaign.<br/><br/>PRECIP seeks to improve our fundamental understanding and prediction of the processes that produce extreme precipitation through an ingredients-based physical framework. Research observations will be collected in four event types that meet a global definition of 'extreme' across a spectrum of rainfall intensity and duration: deep convective cores, wide convective cores, broad stratiform regions, and TCs.  The field campaign is innovative in its approach to investigate the universal aspects of extreme rainfall by testing hypotheses that are not directed at only one weather phenomenon, and are therefore transferable to rainfall events that affect the United States. The experiment is designed to maximize the chances of observing a variety of heavy rainfall events in the moisture-rich natural laboratory of Taiwan and western North Pacific in order to find the commonalities. The primary objective is to simplify the complexity of multi-scale interactions by identifying key ingredients and processes in the limiting cases of high intensity and long duration events in a moisture-rich environment. Field measurements will be made to address basic research questions about key ingredients, physical processes, mesoscale structures, and prediction improvement. The core observations will consist of multi-frequency radars, radiosondes, disdrometers, and the Taiwan operational weather network that will be integrated with modeling and data analysis and assimilation to better understand the mechanisms that produce extreme rainfall.<br/><br/>Improved forecasts and understanding of the predictability of heavy rainfall will lead to better warnings and risk communication that will have a strong positive impact on society. Improvements to our understanding of orographic and non-orographic precipitation, physical processes, and model capabilities will have broad application to improve other related weather and climate predictions. The PRECIP dataset will also lead to positive impacts in precipitation estimation, data assimilation, radar meteorology, and hydrology. Concurrent projects with TAHOPE and T-PARCII will strengthen international science collaboration in our common goal of improved extreme weather prediction and will help facilitate the application of the campaign findings toward operations in the future. The joint projects will occur during the period leading up to and including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The Olympics will naturally enhance the broader impacts of the PRECIP research, and will provide a focal point for education and outreach promoting the positive role of science to address global problems such as extreme weather. Additional positive broader impacts are expected for graduate students, early career scientists, and underrepresented groups through mentoring, international science collaborations, and leadership opportunities in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is hard to tell robots what to do, and even harder to tell robots how to handle all possible errors, unanticipated events, and accidents that might happen. This project focuses on enabling robots to understand instructions from users, to fix errors and repair broken processes, objects, and tools, and to improvise and find new and better ways to do tasks. A key part of the research is to enable robots to learn from educational kits and instructional material typically given to children. The researchers plan to use these instructional materials to provide robots with ""physical common sense"" about how the world works, in a similar way we expect children to learn. The research will make programming robots easier and cheaper, and make robots more useful, particularly for domestic and care robots supporting everyday life activities; repair, construction, and decommissioning robots; and exploration and worker robots in the oceans and space.<br/><br/>Technically, this integrative project addresses a longer-term vision and intellectual challenge of developing a library approach to robot behavior generation and learning. The researchers will build a large-scale long-term intelligent physical system that can repair and improvise desired processes and devices.  The system will learn from instruction in the form of a curriculum of training tasks, watching humans do tasks, coaching, practice, less directed play, and reflection.  Evaluation of the proposed work will focus on how well robots can perform suggested activities from the instructional material, repair broken processes and devices, and create processes and devices that achieve new task specifications. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) appropriate libraries can be built in practice and grown over time, 2) relevant experience can be accessed from a large library and combined to exhibit rich behavior comparable to humans, and 3) such a library can support life-long learning for many tasks, rather than a single demonstration of one task in one domain.  Key ideas include the use of task and strategy-specific quantitative models, the development of strategy graphs that combine both symbolic descriptions of how to do a task as well as task-level models, and the use of learned simulators to support mental practice, exploration, and learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The urban areas in this region, intersected by rural areas, share a common environmental settling and history of natural resource exploitation, followed by industrialization, then de-industrialization and little to no population growth. Environmental variability and the need to prepare for and adapt to its impacts pose a new challenge to the urban systems essential to the region's sustainable development. The region is not anticipated to be as severely impacted by environmental change as other parts of the U.S. and might become a corridor of relative stability possible resulting in in-migration and increased economic activities while renewing pressure on natural resources, thus challenging sustainability. The region's urban and rural systems require a holistic assessment of current and future sustainability stressors. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the creation of a network to develop scholarly research and interdisciplinary communication with stakeholders to provide the foundation for a sustainable and resilient strategy on urban systems. The broader social impact of the project will be realized through the resulting coordination and collaboration in the realm of sustainability that will enhance the region's essential infrastructure and quality of life, help safeguard public health, and contribute to economic competitiveness.<br/><br/>Against the backdrop of a growing appreciation among scholars and stakeholders of the sustainability challenges arising from the differential environmental variability, the scientific focus of the project will be on the development of new insights and approaches to supporting new sustainable development modes of urban systems. The objective in organizing and hosting a three day OUTSTEP-LGL conference is to provide a scientific foundation for a sustainability strategy on urban systems for the LGL region by bringing together sustainability and resilience scholars from across academic disciplines and stakeholders. The 'PEOPLES' Resilience Framework will provide the organizing principle of the conference. A session will be devoted to each of the seven dimensions of systems' functionality: 1) Population and Demographics, 2) Ecosystem Services, 3) Organized Governmental Services, 4) Physical Infrastructure and Lifelines, 5) Lifestyle and Community Competence, 6) Economic Services, and 7) Socio-Cultural Services. The conference is expected to initiate a region-wide research and community engagement effort, plans for the sustainable development of urban and rural systems, and thus advance research in the field of urban sustainable systems, adding to the curriculum of participating faculty and benefit the regions' citizens through its sustainability enhancement of urban systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They hypothesize that knowledge of students' science capital can be used as a powerful tool to inform the development of novel teaching approaches, learning strategies, and STEM interventions that will promote academic success. The eight dimensions of science capital that the study will address include science literacy; science-related attitudes, values, and dispositions; knowledge about the transferability of science; science media consumption; participation in out-of-school science learning contexts; family science skills, knowledge and qualifications; knowing people in science-related roles; and talking about science in everyday life. The underlying assumption is that the more of the eight defined dimensions of science capital that a student possesses, the more likely the student will have a positive science identity and will continue post-undergraduate education. The proposed project is the first to investigate science capital as a tool to promote STEM persistence at a Historically Black College and University. The project will produce new insights into student motivations and experiences that faculty can use to personalize and localize science instruction.<br/><br/>Researchers will employ a mixed-methods  and a quasi-experimental design to develop a generalizable instrument to measure students' science capital and use this instrument to inform curricular changes to broaden participation in STEM. The research questions that will guide data collection and analysis are: (1) Using the literature and existing measures as a guide, what kinds of assessment tools can be developed that sufficiently capture students' science capital and are sensitive to the unique assets, interests, and experiences brought by students in HBCU communities? (2) To what extent does faculty development focused on understanding, measuring, incorporating, and promoting students' science capital influence the development of an asset mindset and motivate changes in curriculum design and instructional delivery? (3) How does an overt focus promoting awareness of students' science capital - directed toward both faculty and students - impact student interest, engagement, and persistence in STEM?  The researchers will develop a science capital survey and establish a scale to assess students' science capital level, provide faculty development in asset-based thinking to promote novel program development around student science capital, and pilot the application of science capital inventory in one course to test its potential for student engagement.  By coupling data collection and analysis with program implementation activities, researchers will obtain the information needed to answer the research questions and simultaneously share information and findings with relevant groups in context.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU-UP) program, Broadening Participation in STEM Education Research track, that focuses on the creation and investigation of new theory-driven models and innovations relevant to the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The delivery of healthcare services is changing in response to an increase in chronic conditions. Care is provided by teams often distributed across agencies, rather than by a single physician. The collaboration of a care team has also been extended to include active involvement of patients themselves, home caregivers, and community organizations. Integrating care that spans time, providers, and agencies is a growing challenge that exacerbates barriers to communication and collaboration. Despite its promise, health information technology (HIT) often fails to enhance distributed collaboration over time. Current methods and tools, including electronic health records, do not adequately support collaboration because they become passive information repositories, which do not inform distributed, collaborative reflection and decision-making for chronic care.  This research leverages prior work that (1) generated the framework of collaborative reflection, and (2) prototyped and piloted a novel HIT system named Lilypad, designed to support collaborative reflection within behavioral health.<br/><br/>The three aims of this research are: (1) to understand instances when the process of collaborative reflection breaks down and care advances without reliance on data or inclusion of multiple perspectives from across the care team, (2) to identify potential unintended consequences of HIT-mediated collaborative reflection, and (3) to generate empirically-based design principles for HIT that promotes collaborative reflection. Based on the promising results of exploratory studies, a long-term deployment study will investigate the use of the prototype across organizational boundaries. The first year will engage care teams in participatory design to tailor it for their needs and facilitate a transition to its use. Then, over two years of use, data will be triangulated from a range of methods, including: interviews to gather individual participant attitudes, observation of care team collaboration via use and non-use, and monitoring of usage logs. A sociotechnical study of Lilypad use will provide insight into how novel HIT systems can mediate collaborative reflection. In addition, this study will contribute to literature on unintended negative consequences of HIT use, and provide design and implementation guidelines for moderating these effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Negative shocks often lead to increases in behaviors that results in bad outcomes that may persist into the long run.   However, the mechanisms through which natural disasters affect decision making are not known.  This research will use experimental methods to study the effects of a natural disaster on household decision making in the immediate aftermath of the natural disaster.  Specifically, the research will investigate the following: (i) what are the human and economic losses due to the disaster, (ii) the effects on health decisions such as medical testing, taking medications, (iii) changes in individual choices that may reinforce or reduce the initial effects, and (iv) how household cope with the disaster.  This project's findings can reveal many consequences of natural disasters: disruption of programs to combat epidemics such as HIV/AIDS or measles.  Understanding the mechanisms through which natural disasters affect decisions with risky outcomes will help policy makers to craft more effective ways to help reduce the damaging effects of natural disasters. <br/><br/>This research project seeks to answer the following questions: (i) how does a natural disaster affect the health and economic outcomes of households in the immediate aftermath? (ii) how do household make decisions about health care immediately after the disaster? (iii) how do changes in individual preferences mediate these effects (will the disaster affect household risk or time preference)? and (iv) what mechanisms do households adopted to cope with the disaster?   The researchers will leverage prior randomization at the community and individual levels in an on-going project in the area to identify the causal effects of natural disaster on these outcomes.  A major contribution of this research project is the collection of ephemeral data on household preferences and healthy behaviors in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.   The presence of the research team in the disaster area allows the team to collect the appropriate ephemeral data.   The results of this research project will provide important data sets to study household behavior in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.

This is directly relevant to the National Space Weather Plan, since the work can lead to better models and forecasts of space weather, which affects national commercial and defense satellites and space-based communications. Additionally, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research.<br/><br/>This project quantifies the impact of the electron thermal anisotropy on the magnetotail current sheet structure and investigates the variation of characteristics of electron thermal anisotropy with geomagnetic activity. The anisotropic electron population can be responsible for generation of strong currents (induced by particle curvature drifts) and can serve as an energy source for various electromagnetic wave emissions. The project uses observations from five spacecraft missions (Geotail, Cluster, THEMIS, ARTEMIS, and MMS) covering the entire magnetotail within the radial distances from 10 to 80 Earth radii downtail. Using several years of THEMIS/ARTEMIS observations in the near-Earth and middle magnetotail, the work studies both the radial distribution of the electron thermal anisotropy and the impact of electron anisotropic currents on current sheet structure for different magnetotail configurations. Moreover, using MMS observations with the high-resolution plasma measurements the work will for the first time statistically reveal the fine structure of the electron anisotropic population and its contribution to the current density.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To efficiently plan motions neccessitates having complete information about the robot's environment beforehand, then building efficient algorithms that produces a trajectory the robot can utilize; unfortunately, this has proven difficult to achieve. To mitigate this shortcoming, sampling-based algorithms were developed that approximate the information given about the environment. Analysis of these algorithms shows that if a trajectory exists, these sampling algorithms will find such trajectory. The question that arises, though, is how well was the environment information approximated to ensure a high success rate. This project will develop algorithms that better approximate the environment information planning space by producing a measure for this approximation using topology and geometric based formulations. This project will give more control to sampling algorithms to help determine what areas in the environment needs more attention and representation, which will in turn improve on the time needed to perform motion planning.<br/><br/>Motivated by the increasing need for motion planning algorithms that are fast and accurate even when they approximate the planning space, and a need to also measure such approximations so as to better manipulate and control the planning process, this project aims to devise a set of formal representations and algorithms to a) better characterize the topology of the planning space, b) combine formal methods to plan and approximate the planning space, c) provide a measure of such approximations and utilize this information to better guide planning in difficult regions, and d) subsequently reduce planning time and memory use which will potentially lead to more real time planning algorithms. In addition, the algorithms and theorems developed in this project will be adaptable to any planning method in any type of environment (dynamic, complex or heterogeneous). This research thus removes a major barrier in the current practice of motion planning where approximate techniques are the state of the art. This project will greatly increase the scalability of motion planning algorithms because it will be topologically rich with information, measure the sampling approximations made in the planning space, and subsequently give a more informed description of these planning spaces. This project will capture in a unique and novel way the topology of the planning space using mathematical formulations such as the Vietoris Rips complex, graph ""gluing"", and an innovative use of simplicial collapses in planning algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities.  RESNA's membership consists of individuals and institutions covering a range of disciplines (including researchers, clinicians, suppliers, manufacturers, consumers and educators who work in both non-profit and for-profit settings), all of whom are dedicated to promoting the exchange of ideas and information for the advancement of assistive technology.  The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a forum for interaction between experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field.  Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event provides participants with experience and skills that help them succeed in their engineering and design careers.  It encourages and mentors students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields, and provides an opportunity for the students to network with their peers as well as with participants in previous SDCs, many of whom are now leaders in service, research, and education related to technology for persons with disabilities.  All participants (not just the finalists) create blog posts that capture and archive their submissions, which remain accessible indefinitely through the RESNA website and the assistive technology AT Wiki.  Thus, educators can share this information with their students as examples of projects that others have done, while service providers and persons with disabilities can search for unique solutions to barriers they may face.  <br/><br/>The annual RESNA Student Design Competition (workshop) fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities.  The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference; since then over 265 designs have been identified as winning entries from among over 850 submitted by students from over 125 different universities and institutes of higher learning.  Both undergraduate and master's level graduate candidates are eligible to submit entries, which must represent the work of students only; no faculty or professionals may be included as co-authors, although faculty may be mentioned as advisors and/or mentors.  This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities.  A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools.  The content of all submissions, not merely the finalists, will be captured and accessed through the RESNA SDC website.  Five industry-savvy judges will review the submissions and select at least 7 semi-finalist teams from which two representatives will be invited to attend the conference and present their working prototypes to determine the finalists.  The teams will give 10-minute presentations to the judging panel on June 24 in a session open to all who are interested and in which the teams will interact with the judges, members of other teams and all who attend the session.  The conference schedule includes a platform session where the finalists can present their designs to the general conference audience.  In addition, finalists will have an opportunity to present their projects during the Developers' Showcase, which highlights new products under development (some past SDC student team designs have been patented and are now available commercially).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Few people survive and many structures cannot withstand encounters with pyroclastic flows, making them the deadliest features generated from explosive volcanic eruptions. Dilute pyroclastic flows are particularly hazardous because they are less constrained to follow topography, making them much more unpredictable. These flows typically terminate when the ground hugging current becomes less dense than the surrounding atmosphere and reverses buoyancy, at which point it rises up to form ash-laden plumes.  Understanding the mechanism and rate of this buoyancy reversal, and ultimately the runout distance of these flows, is necessary for accurate hazard prediction and for interpreting deposits of past eruptions.  Likewise understanding the formation of buoyant plumes is necessary to understand the  aviation and ashfall hazards 100's of kilometers from the eruptions.  As the world's population continues to grow, deadly encounters with volcanic eruptions will increase rapidly, and thus scientists need to accurately predict their behavior, including impact force, runout distance, and buoyancy reversal in order to mitigate their hazards. In addition to those societal impacts, graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoc are supported by this award. Interactive tools and videos are also being developed around this work, to be distributed to K-12 educators as well as via the National Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>Because the destructiveness of pyroclastic flows inhibits direct measurements, this study will combine physical analog experiments with multiphase numerical modeling to establish how pyroclastic flow properties, dynamic pressures, and buoyancy evolve during travel.  Ground hugging flows can reverse their buoyancy if enough pumice and ash is deposited and/or if enough air is entrained and heated, expanding the flow.  At present, this reversal is often posited as an abrupt terminating condition for the progression of the flow on the ground.  Counter, however, to assumptions used in parameterized models, the processes that result in buoyancy reversal, entrainment and deposition, are heterogeneous and can alter concentration gradients as indicated by previous analog experiments, multiphase numerical models, and field evidence.  Indeed, previous approaches that treat such currents as uniform oversimplify entrainment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of flow dynamics.  As the behavior and runout of turbulent currents are strongly dictated by the development of buoyancy reversal, a better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between sedimentation and entrainment is needed to develop more realistic models. Experiments in the Experimental Volcanology Laboratory (Smithsonian Institution) will investigate how buoyancy evolves due to entrainment in stratified currents. Experiments using the Deep Water Basin in the Morphodynamics Laboratory (UT Austin) will investigate how entrainment evolves in stratified currents modified by particle settling. Each set of experiments will provide independent and crucial information about how instabilities develop and incorporate ambient fluid into stratified currents, and how these processes control the rate and location of buoyancy reversal and liftoff. Three dimensional data from the experiments will be directly compared to multiphase numerical simulations (UOregon) to validate stratification evolution and liftoff conditions under end-member scenarios. A suite of simulations will also be used to explore the mixing processes and mass balance during the initiation of liftoff in ways not possible with parameterized entrainment models. This study aims to investigate heterogeneous deposition and entrainment in turbulent, stratified, particle-laden currents using complementary analog experiments and multiphase numerical models to establish how pyroclastic flow properties, dynamic pressures, and buoyancy evolve during transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this EAGER project, an exploratory idea of using epitaxial perovskite oxide heterostructure is investigated as a novel platform for high performance, energy-efficient computing. The approaches developed in this proposal are creative and original because although there have been many research and development efforts on the new logic devices, there is minimal work on how oxide thin films can lead the way to better computing. Thus, if successful, this research will lead researchers to rethink the role of oxides in computing devices and ultimately contribute to tackling today's most significant computing challenge. In this project, an innovative device solution is introduced by synergistically combining multiple disciplines in advanced materials. The primary educational goal of this project is to directly integrate the state-of-the-art research outcome into the curriculum of UTSA, which is a research-intensive, Hispanic-serving institution. An educational barrier that has existed as a great challenge in training underrepresented minority students with project-based research is expected to be overcome by developing the virtual laboratory environment. <br/>             <br/>The specific research objective of this proposal is to determine the best ways of constructing the electrostrictive field-effect transistor (FET) device structure and understand the main factors that contribute to its superior device performance in terms of speed, power, and reliability. Based on preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that the epitaxial oxide heterostructure, prepared by the advanced oxide-MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) technique, will achieve maximum strain transfer from the top piezoelectric gate oxide layer to the bottom memristive channel layer, thereby leading to successful demonstration of the electrostrictive FET. To test feasibility of such a novel device structure, both the theoretical and experimental approaches will be adopted to investigate each oxide layer as key components of the high-speed, low-power logic device. This research will enhance a fundamental understanding of how a piezoelectric material can be best matched with a channel material for maximum electrostrictive FET device performance. The proposed work is of great intellectual significance because ultimately, it will provide a right insight on how this innovative technology will be positioned as the next-generation logic as benchmarked with other existing or emerging device candidates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.<br/><br/><br/>This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hardware implementations of DNNs are of critical importance for the ubiquitous embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which call for high performance in energy and resource constrained systems. This project aims to address the challenges when mapping complicated DNN models into hardware for energy-efficient and performance-driven implementations. The proposed techniques will promote wider adoptions of deep learning into both high-performance and low-power computing systems. The project will also enhance economic opportunities and have significant societal benefits via solutions that support broader adoption of intelligent systems for big data analytics, weather modeling and forecasting, disease diagnosis and drug delivery, and medical image processing. The research advances will be incorporated into coursework taught by the investigators. Activities on engaging underrepresented, undergraduate, and K12 students will be designed in collaboration with the Northeastern University Center of STEM Education and University of Southern California's Viterbi Center for Engineering Diversity. All software code from the project will be released via GitHub and educational modules and tutorials will be make available to the research community, industry, and government.<br/> <br/>Exploring the inherent model redundancy of DNNs, this project will develop an algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework for greatly reducing DNN computation and storage requirements by leveraging ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers), a powerful optimization technique. This project first solves the challenge in the application of ADMM due to the non-convex objective function in DNN training, and thereby lack of guarantees on solution feasibility, solution quality, and low runtime. Therefore, an integrated framework of ADMM regularization and masked mapping and retraining will be developed and further improvements on solution quality, performance-driven computation/storage reduction, and hardware feasibility will be investigated. Next, the project proposes a unified weight and intermediate result pruning and quantization technique that explores all four redundancy sources of DNN models. Due to the impact on energy efficiency of hardware implementations of DNNs, nearly all DNN models, or at least the most computationally intensive convolutional layers can be then placed on a single chip. Finally, design-time parameterization and algorithm-hardware co-design solutions will be developed for efficient utilization of available hardware resources, achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and adaptation capability. Extensive experimentation and evaluation will be performed to validate and tune the proposed technique with prototype systems using FPGA devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnetic reversals are detected in the geological record at irregular intervals of roughly several hundred thousand years, whereas modern ground-based observations reveal abrupt changes in the magnetic field over just a few years. Higher fidelity records from recent satellite missions now suggest that the abrupt changes in the magnetic field occur more frequently than previously believed. These events affect our ability to forecast the magnetic field, yet the origin of these disturbances is poorly understood.  One viable interpretation involves waves at the top of the core. The investigators have found several types of waves that account for the periods and spatial patterns of the magnetic disturbance. The goal of this research is to detect these waves in geomagnetic observations and to recover estimates for the wave propagation speeds. This information will enhance our ability to forecast the magnetic field, and it will also provide unique insights into the physical state of the Earth's core, which will improve our understanding of how the magnetic field is generated by convection in the core.  The project will support the research of a Hispanic graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.

The investigators intend to use the wave models to extract information about the physical conditions that prevail near the core-mantle boundary, including the possible presence of stable stratification. They also seek to characterize the source mechanism for the waves because it connects the wave amplitudes to convective processes deeper in the core. The researchers also plan to search for evidence of topography on the core-mantle boundary using high-fidelity records of time variations in the geomagnetic field.

Similar waves occur in the atmosphere, but atmospheric gravity waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally.  Vertical propagation means that activity near the surface, such as winds blowing over mountains or updrafts in convective clouds, can influence the circulation at stratospheric levels.  Stratospheric circulation can in turn affect surface weather over much of the globe, and is a potential source of long-range forecast skill. Thus the driving of the stratosphere by gravity waves is a topic of both practical and scientific interest.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design a satellite constellation for observing atmospheric gravity waves. The constellation consists of nine low-cost cubesats using radio occultation (RO) to detect gravity waves in temperature profiles extending through the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. RO is a technique which measures the refraction of signals from satellites of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, which includes the GPS satellites) as they pass through the atmosphere.  At the levels of interest refraction can be used to deduce atmospheric temperature, thus the constellation would produce nine simultaneous temperature profiles, each containing wiggles indicating the presence of gravity waves.  These could be combined to determine the three-dimensional structure of a wave packet, from which its propagation and likely influence on stratospheric circulation could be inferred. <br/><br/>The project is a feasibility study in which the PIs use a high-resolution atmospheric model, the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS, in a global nonhydrostatic configuration), to generate realistic vertically propagating gravity waves. A virtual constellation ""orbits"" over the model simulation to determine what observations would be produced by the satellites for a given wave field and a given set of satellite, orbit, and instrument characteristics.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance due to the desirability of better gravity wave representations in models used for weather prediction and to provide guidance to decision makers.

The subsidence favors clear skies and promotes the hot, dry conditions found in regions like the Sahara, the Kalahari, and the Southwestern United States. Model simulations of future climate change consistently show an expansion of the HCs, by perhaps a degree of latitude over the 21st century. Recent studies show evidence that HC expansion has already taken place and is greater than model simulations would suggest. HC expansion has clear implications for water resources and is thus a topic of practical as well as scientific interest.<br/><br/>Beyond their impact on the climate of the tropics and subtropics the HCs play an important global role through their transports of moisture, energy, angular momentum, and chemical constituents.  The angular momentum transport of the HCs is responsible for the subtropical jets (STJs) which occur at the outer edge of the HC in each hemisphere.  Beyond the STJs there are eddy-driven jets (EDJs), which owe their existence to the north-south temperature contrast of the middle latitudes and the associated weather patterns.  The expansion of the HCs is expected to cause the EDJs and STJs to shift poleward, meaning to higher latitudes in each hemisphere. But these expectations are not quite met.  There is a robust association between the expansion of the HC, the EDJ, and the poleward edge of the subtropcal dry zone in each hemisphere. On the other hand,  HC expansion has at best a weak effect on STJ latitude, contrary to expectations based on the dynamical connection between HCs and STJs. Also, measures of the width of the subtropics based on satellite observations of outgoing longwave radiation do not show the expected signature of HC expansion.  The dynamical implications of these discrepancies are examined in this project, as well as their consequences for future climate change.<br/><br/>A further issue addressed here is the role of the HCs, STJs, and EDJs in the transport and planetary-scale distribution of radiatively and chemically active trace gases.  In particular, a better understanding of this transport is important for understanding the distribution of methane, the hydroxyl radical, and ozone depleting substances relevant to the ozone hole.  Previous research suggests a role for the latitude of the Northern Hemisphere EDJ in regulating tracer transport into the Arctic, and there are also indications that transport from the northern mid-latitudes into the northern tropics and the Southern Hemisphere is sensitive to characteristics of the HC and the STJ. These linkages are addressed here in a suite of simulations from models at varying levels of complexity.  In addition, transport estimates differ widely among simulation from different models, and models also tend to overestimate the length of time for which tracers remain in the atmosphere.  These differences and their dynamical causes are examined using simulations from models participating in the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative, a coordinated international effort to produce simulations with a common protocol that can be directly compared.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the water resource implications of dry zone expansion, as noted above. The work on tracer transport is also of societal interest due to the role of long-range tracer transport in determining local air quality, and for understanding potential obstacles to the recovery of the ozone hole. In addition, the project promotes workforce development by providing support and training for two graduate students.  The students are encouraged to participate in various forms of outreach, including outreach to K-12 schools and adult education classes at Johns Hopkins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Few people survive and many structures cannot withstand encounters with pyroclastic flows, making them the deadliest features generated from explosive volcanic eruptions. Dilute pyroclastic flows are particularly hazardous because they are less constrained to follow topography, making them much more unpredictable. These flows typically terminate when the ground hugging current becomes less dense than the surrounding atmosphere and reverses buoyancy, at which point it rises up to form ash-laden plumes.  Understanding the mechanism and rate of this buoyancy reversal, and ultimately the runout distance of these flows, is necessary for accurate hazard prediction and for interpreting deposits of past eruptions.  Likewise understanding the formation of buoyant plumes is necessary to understand the  aviation and ashfall hazards 100's of kilometers from the eruptions.  As the world's population continues to grow, deadly encounters with volcanic eruptions will increase rapidly, and thus scientists need to accurately predict their behavior, including impact force, runout distance, and buoyancy reversal in order to mitigate their hazards. In addition to those societal impacts, graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoc are supported by this award. Interactive tools and videos are also being developed around this work, to be distributed to K-12 educators as well as via the National Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>Because the destructiveness of pyroclastic flows inhibits direct measurements, this study will combine physical analog experiments with multiphase numerical modeling to establish how pyroclastic flow properties, dynamic pressures, and buoyancy evolve during travel.  Ground hugging flows can reverse their buoyancy if enough pumice and ash is deposited and/or if enough air is entrained and heated, expanding the flow.  At present, this reversal is often posited as an abrupt terminating condition for the progression of the flow on the ground.  Counter, however, to assumptions used in parameterized models, the processes that result in buoyancy reversal, entrainment and deposition, are heterogeneous and can alter concentration gradients as indicated by previous analog experiments, multiphase numerical models, and field evidence.  Indeed, previous approaches that treat such currents as uniform oversimplify entrainment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of flow dynamics.  As the behavior and runout of turbulent currents are strongly dictated by the development of buoyancy reversal, a better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between sedimentation and entrainment is needed to develop more realistic models. Experiments in the Experimental Volcanology Laboratory (Smithsonian Institution) will investigate how buoyancy evolves due to entrainment in stratified currents. Experiments using the Deep Water Basin in the Morphodynamics Laboratory (UT Austin) will investigate how entrainment evolves in stratified currents modified by particle settling. Each set of experiments will provide independent and crucial information about how instabilities develop and incorporate ambient fluid into stratified currents, and how these processes control the rate and location of buoyancy reversal and liftoff. Three dimensional data from the experiments will be directly compared to multiphase numerical simulations (UOregon) to validate stratification evolution and liftoff conditions under end-member scenarios. A suite of simulations will also be used to explore the mixing processes and mass balance during the initiation of liftoff in ways not possible with parameterized entrainment models. This study aims to investigate heterogeneous deposition and entrainment in turbulent, stratified, particle-laden currents using complementary analog experiments and multiphase numerical models to establish how pyroclastic flow properties, dynamic pressures, and buoyancy evolve during transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reproducible containers developed from this project will package code, data, environment, provenance, and assumptions across heterogeneous computing platforms. In contrast to taking a ""devops""-based approach, which burdens the user to manage reproducibility of experiments, this project uses reference executions of scientific experiments as a virtualization method for containerizing associated artifacts. <br/><br/>While a container-based approach can help to verify repeat computations, further advancements in container technology are needed to enable advanced forms of reproducibility.

To that end, the project will develop an open-source container runtime that will offer primitives for enabling re-runnability, extensibility, and publish-ability of containers.  The work leverages portable containers developed previously for computational sciences.

However, it is still challenging for them to fly robustly in natural or human-constructed environments, where they routinely encounter various forms of unsteady ambient flow or wind gusts. Flying animals such as insects and birds can attenuate the adverse effects of unsteady ambient flow with much greater success, due to the inherent aerodynamic capability of their flapping wings. Therefore, this project aims to establish the fundamental science underlying the fluid dynamics of flapping wings interacting with unsteady flow structures. This project will quantify the flow patterns and force production of flapping wings in interaction with various wind gusts to understand the best behavior for flapping wings to overcome the ambient flow disturbances. The results of this research will provide a foundation of scientific knowledge rather than mere intuition to develop better MAVs that can quickly recover from atmospheric gusts. Because of the cross-disciplinary and collaborative efforts in experimental fluid dynamics and robotics, this award will also expose undergraduate students to graduate-level research, thereby inspiring them to pursue advanced degrees or careers in STEM majors. Moreover, through K-12 education and outreach activities, this project will increase the public awareness and underrepresented groups engagements in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate the performance and the flow physics of flapping wings in interactions with unsteady ambient flow structures. This will be enabled by 1) parsing the complex wing-gust interaction problem into the interactions between four canonical types of gust structures and flapping wings in four kinematic configurations; and 2) coalescing tools in experimental and theoretical fluid dynamics with reinforcement learning methods. This research will first use parametric experimental studies to provide a comprehensive quantification of the gust-mitigation performance of flapping wings. Then, it will develop fundamental understandings of the flow physics pertinent to the interactions between wing-generated and ambient flow structures, in terms of vortex shedding pattern, vorticity transport dynamics, and aerodynamic force production. Effects of three-dimensionality and stability of the leading edge vortex (LEV) on gust-mitigation and vorticity dynamics will be studied. Finally, this research will use reinforcement learning methods and hardware-in-the-loop optimization to optimize the gust-mitigation performance of bioinspired robotic flapping wings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ergodic theory focuses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed especially in the particular case when the group of symmetries is non-amenable which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. Non-amenable groups naturally arise in many parts of mathematics such as geometry and number theory. This project is concerned with developing the tools needed to analyze the statistical behavior of non-amenable group actions by generalizing ergodic theory to this context. <br/><br/>The research goals of this project are: 1) Continue developing sofic entropy theory, which is a vast generalization of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy to actions of sofic groups, a class of groups that contains all amenable groups and residually finite groups. One ambitious goal is to classify the mixing Markov chains over free groups using asymptotic geometric invariants of associated model spaces. 2) Classify sofic approximations of low-dimensional groups (using geometric techniques), with an eye towards using the results to construct the first known non-sofic groups from amalgams of low-dimensional groups. 3) Explore the limits of pointwise ergodic theorems for geometrically defined groups (e.g. Lie groups, CAT(0) cubulated groups, relatively hyperbolic groups) via the measured-equivalence techniques developed by the principal investigator and Nevo and the ideas behind the recent L^1-counterexample of Tao. Also develop new multiplicative ergodic theorems for cocycles taking values in tracial von Neumann algebras. 4) Import tools from geometric group theory into the study of measured equivalence relations (MERs) through the use of metric bundles in place of actions, graphings in place of Cayley graphs and so on. More specific goals include proving analogs of the Tits alternative for MERs and classifying the normal sub-equivalence relations of low-dimensional MERs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similar waves occur in the atmosphere, but atmospheric gravity waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally.  Vertical propagation means that activity near the surface, such as winds blowing over mountains or updrafts in convective clouds, can influence the circulation at stratospheric levels.  Stratospheric circulation can in turn affect surface weather over much of the globe, and is a potential source of long-range forecast skill. Thus the driving of the stratosphere by gravity waves is a topic of both practical and scientific interest.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design a satellite constellation for observing atmospheric gravity waves. The constellation consists of nine low-cost cubesats using radio occultation (RO) to detect gravity waves in temperature profiles extending through the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. RO is a technique which measures the refraction of signals from satellites of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, which includes the GPS satellites) as they pass through the atmosphere.  At the levels of interest refraction can be used to deduce atmospheric temperature, thus the constellation would produce nine simultaneous temperature profiles, each containing wiggles indicating the presence of gravity waves.  These could be combined to determine the three-dimensional structure of a wave packet, from which its propagation and likely influence on stratospheric circulation could be inferred. <br/><br/>The project is a feasibility study in which the PIs use a high-resolution atmospheric model, the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS, in a global nonhydrostatic configuration), to generate realistic vertically propagating gravity waves. A virtual constellation ""orbits"" over the model simulation to determine what observations would be produced by the satellites for a given wave field and a given set of satellite, orbit, and instrument characteristics.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance due to the desirability of better gravity wave representations in models used for weather prediction and to provide guidance to decision makers.

Such understanding will directly impact the ability to engineer the formation of nanometer scale precipitates (particles) within these Ti alloys, leading to substantially higher strengths. The proposed research effort brings together state-of-the-art characterization tools for addressing these precipitation mechanisms. While the focus of the proposed program is on titanium alloys, it should be noted that the mechanisms being investigated are applicable in general to other metallic materials, and, in principle, also to other types of materials, such as ceramics. Additionally, the program will also illustrate the advantage of using state-of-the-art tools in a correlative manner for nanoscale characterization which will be applicable to a wide range of metallic materials beyond Ti alloys. The successful implementation of the proposed research will result in new science and have a significant impact on industrial exploitation of materials and hence will make a positive contribution to the Nation's economy. The accurate mechanistic understandings developed will be used to inform computational tools, improving their accuracy, and this will have a marked impact on industry. The educational outreach will consist of multiple components, including the development of simple yet attractive modules, based on scanning electron microscopy, for high school and undergraduate students as well as the general public to the fascinating world of metals and materials in general. Such activities will have a significant influence on encouraging high school students with diverse ethnic backgrounds to enter science and engineering disciplines. These educational activities will closely couple with the educational and outreach activities of the Center for the Accelerated Maturation of Materials at Ohio State University. Due to its geographic location, the College of Engineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at University of North Texas are in a unique position to offer such education and training to the workforce of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. In addition, the university has a substantial segment of students of Hispanic origin. These students will gain substantially from the research and education activities associated with this program.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>This research program involves a focused effort aimed at formulating a detailed understanding of the factors influencing refined alpha precipitation in titanium (Ti) alloys, and its consequent impact on deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties. More specifically, this program focuses on the influence of metastable precursors, involving structural and compositional variations within the parent matrix, on solid-state precipitation of fine scale alpha in Ti alloys and its consequent influence on deformation mechanisms. The significance of this program stems from the interrelationship between the complex, often hierarchical (multiple length scales) microstructure, and properties in these (as in other) alloys. In the main, these interrelationships have been determined experimentally, and to reduce the time and costs of materials development and optimization, in the future these quantities will be the subject of prediction by computational models. The successful development of such computational models of microstructural evolution and deformation depends critically on accurate descriptions of the nucleation process, so that the models may be as physically relevant as possible. Furthermore, it is now well recognized that classical nucleation theories, based purely on statistical considerations, are in many cases inadequate descriptions for developing robust computational models. Hence, it is the role of this program to provide such accurate mechanistic descriptions of both intrinsic and extrinsic (e.g., metastable instabilities in the beta phase) factors that influence the nucleation process. Under this program these mechanisms will be derived solely from critical experiments. Additionally, the critical deformation mechanisms and resulting mechanical properties corresponding to such refined scale alpha distributions within the beta matrix of Ti alloys will be investigated under this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to examine the efficacy of a Virtual Peer Mentoring Program in developing culturally responsive mentorship leadership skills, STEM self-efficacy, and science identities among UMW students. In this project, graduate and senior-level undergraduate students will use a systematic process to mentor a group of freshman, sophomore, and junior undergraduate students in a virtual environment. Prior to engaging in the virtual mentoring relationship, mentors and mentees will be trained using case-based virtual training modules to socialize the mentors and mentees to the mentoring relationship and build skills in leadership, mentoring, and cultural responsiveness. The project will extend current research by identifying effective types of mentoring relationships and modes for these relationships in STEM degree programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and for underrepresented minority women students in general. It is expected to document the effectiveness of an intervention to increase STEM persistence for UMW undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The overarching framework for the study combines persistence, self-efficacy, identity, and mentoring research theories. A multiphase mixed-method research approach will be used to answer the following research questions: (1) After participating in the virtual mentorship training, what changes, if any, do student mentors and mentees self-report in their STEM mentorship, leadership, and cultural responsiveness skills? (2) After participating in the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program, what changes, if any, do student mentors and mentees self-report in their STEM self-efficacy from pretest to posttest survey as compared to a waitlist control group?

How do student mentors and mentees believe the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program is useful, if at all, in furthering their STEM identity? (4) How do student mentors and mentees persist, if at all, in their STEM degree program during the duration of the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program?  After participating in the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program, how do student mentors and mentees self-report intent to persist in their STEM degree programs and pursuit of a STEM career pathway? How, if at all, were the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program components effective in supporting student mentors and mentees? intent to persist in a STEM degree program and, ultimately, in their intent to pursue a STEM career pathway?  The multiphase design will allow for examination of quantitative and qualitative data over time to answer the proposed research questions and assess the program objectives. This design allows for use of descriptive and randomized controlled trial designs for quantitative data collection and a case study lens for qualitative data collection.

For instance, the information we seek may be the temperature at the core of a tree (the wood underneath the bark). Or, say, the temperature of soil located deep down underground. In both examples, performing direct measurements would require disrupting the object of study (drilling the tree; drilling the ground) which is expensive and disruptive.  Instead, with the mathematics-based methods developed in this project it is enough to measure temperature on the tree's bark, or on the earth's surface (and neither requires drilling). Then one plots the easily-collected data into an integral (the ""big sister"" of the integrals studied in calculus) and the output of this integral will be the temperature at the core of the tree (or temperature of the soil deep underground). The part of mathematics that deals with these problems is called ""harmonic analysis"" and ""singular integrals""; the methods employed are called ""integral representation formulas."" These methods work even for e.g., trees that have very rough bark (""fractal-like"") as opposed to smooth bark (""integral formulas for non-smooth domains"").<br/><br/>This project brings together techniques and problems from different parts of the general field of analysis, with primary emphasis on complex function theory in one and several complex variables, and on real harmonic analysis on Euclidean space. One of the main goals is to develop a theory of Cauchy-like singular integrals with holomorphic kernel and for non-smooth domains in n-dimensional complex Euclidean space that successfully blends the complex structure of the ambient domain with the Calderon-Zygmund theory for singular integrals on non-smooth domains in 2n-dimensional real space. Stripping away the smoothness assumptions brings to the fore the geometric interplay between the operators and the domains on which they act: recent advances by Lanzani and her collaborators have set the ground for pushing this theory well below the C2-category and for bringing it on par with the real analysis techniques that were developed over the past thirty years in Geometric Measure Theory, Partial Differential Equations and Quasiconformal mapping. A novel component builds upon recent work by the principal investigator and her collaborator M. Pramanik and seeks to investigate the aforementioned holomorphic singular integral operators by exploring suitable symmetrized forms of their Schwartz kernels. Further problems include the investigation of div-curl inequalities in the context of the d-bar complex in complex Euclidean space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Holycross will perform experiments to calibrate a new proxy for oxygen in eclogites, metamorphic rocks formed on subducting slabs that have made their way back to the surface. Following experimental calibration, she will apply the new proxy to determine how ancient and modern suites of natural eclogites track spatial and temporal variations in the oxidation state of subduction zones. During her tenure as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, Dr. Holycross will host educational events at both the National Museum of Natural History and the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History to share the excitement of geoscience with the public. She will also develop a virtual peer-to-peer mentoring and support group to connect early career scientists at 8+ U.S. institutions. <br/><br/>Eclogites form on subducting slabs during high-pressure and high-temperature alteration of oceanic basalts. Therefore they may retain important information about the oxidation state (or oxygen fugacity, fO2) of their basalt precursor, or alternately, their oxidation state may be a result of the mass transfer of oxidized materials throughout the subduction system. Comprehensive interrogation of the eclogite fO2 record, and understanding the geological significance of these values, requires an experimentally calibrated proxy that can be applied to natural samples using commonly available analytical tools. Eclogitic mineral assemblages (here, rutile, garnet and pyroxene) are excellent candidates for the development of a new fO2 proxy that will utilize the sensitivity of the multivalent trace element vanadium (V) to changes in redox environment. Vanadium shifts speciation (V2+, V3+, V4+, V5+) over Earth-relevant fO2s, and thus the incorporation of Vanadium in different phases should change as function of oxygen fugacity. Eclogite-melting piston-cylinder experiments will be run to calibrate the partitioning of Vanadium between rutile, pyroxene, garnet and silicate melt as a function of fO2, pressure and temperature. The new fO2 proxy will be applied to Archean eclogite xenoliths from West Africa and an exhumed Eocene terrane from the Cyclades subduction complex in Greece to probe redox changes in subducting slabs over time (scale of billions of years) and space (scale of a subduction zone).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modifications produce new compounds that have important chemical properties.  The research group is particularly interested in the synthesis of complex molecules found in small quantities in nature (natural products). The modification of pryones is conducted using metal catalysts but when there are multiple choices for modification, achieving a single, preferred option is challenging. Through the careful choice of chemical reagents and conditions, Professor Sarpong and coworkers strategically design specific changes in the starting molecules, setting the stage for the synthesis of compounds of potential pharmaceutical relevance. Professor Sarpong and his coworkers serve as mentors to under-represented minority students in the greater Oakland, CA area.  They also visit classrooms and conduct demonstrations at area science festivals. Professor Sarpong continues to inspire students worldwide through TED-style talks.<br/><br/>Professor Sarpong and his coworkers use 3,5-dibromo-2-pyrone for the synthesis of various classes of natural products. Key to this approach is site-selective cross-couplings to a dihalogenated pyrone, which sets the stage for sequential pericyclic processes resulting in a rapid increase in target-relevant complexity. Through this combination of controlled peripheral functionalization and rearrangements of the core structure (framework reconstruction), the synthesis of complex natural products such as secondary metabolites isolated from Incarvillea delavayi, Cephalotaxus sinensis and decahydroazulenes is studied. These advances provide complementary approaches to complex molecules of biological relevance starting from a relatively simple starting input, 3,5-dibromo-pyrone.

It soon became clear that it was necessary to understand statistical mechanics, i.e., how the mechanical motion and interactions of the extremely large number of atoms and molecules determine macroscopic thermodynamic parameters of the gas, such as the pressure or temperature. Since then, the ideas and methods initially set forth to understand the heat to work transformation have been extended to fluid motion, electrical conduction, chemical reactions and many more settings. In the last 30 years, they have been applied to a diverse variety of system formed by a large number of interacting elementary constituents like neural network, animal populations, large human networks and economic systems. These successes notwithstanding, the deep conceptual and mathematical foundations of statistical mechanics are incomplete, especially so for the non-equilibrium case. This project is aimed to improve understanding of these foundations.<br/><br/>Mark Kac introduced a very simplified model to study convergence to equilibrium and emergence of effective macroscopic equations (the Boltzmann equation) in a dilute gas of colliding hard spheres. Thanks to the simplicity of this model one can compute exactly the spectral gap of the evolution and prove uniform convergence of the one-particle distribution to the solution of the Boltzmann-Kac equation. This comes at the price of losing all spatial structure and thus the ability to investigate crucial phenomena such as local equilibrium and approach to non-equilibrium steady states. This project will extend the Kac model by reintroducing a space structure and connecting it with heat and particle reservoirs in such a way as to obtain a model that is closer to a real gas but still is rigorously treatable. By improving the mathematical techniques developed to study complex dynamics of large systems, like scaling limits, hyperbolic dynamics, and functional inequalities, the Principal Investigator will extend the results known for the Kac system to this richer and more realistic model. Although most of the work will be of analytic nature, numerical simulation will be used as a guide toward more rigorous understanding. The final goal is to have a model where one can rigorously describe the transition from microscopic collision dynamics to a mesoscopic Boltzmann type equation and finally to a macroscopic thermodynamic/hydrodynamic fluid evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building on prior accomplishments supported by federal funding under the Department of Labor's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program, this project focuses the new-collar field of mechatronics, which combines mechanical, electronic, and computer technologies.  Mechatronics technicians work with 3D printers, electromechanical systems, robotic devices, and other technologies to contribute to sectors ranging from agriculture and advanced manufacturing to renewable energy and telecommunications.  The project will implement the Siemens Mechatronic Systems curriculum to develop a stackable, industry-recognized certification program and an Associate of Science degree. The Siemens curriculum uses a systems approach to mechatronics education that emphasizes how multiple technologies coexist and interact. This approach helps students learn how to troubleshoot, maintain, and operate an entire automated system, rather than just individual components.  As a result, students who complete the mechatronics certification and/or degree will be prepared for well-paying jobs in growing industries, thus contributing to the US skilled technical workforce and economy.<br/><br/>This project has four goals:  1) redevelop the curriculum to realign the current Advanced Manufacturing Mechatronics Certificate with the Siemens Mechatronics Level 1 Certification; 2) provide professional development and training for College faculty to earn Siemens Level 1 Mechatronics Instructor certification; 3) investigate the program enhancements needed to implement Siemens Level 2 certification at a later date; 4) raise interest in and awareness of an advanced manufacturing career involving mechatronics in the local area. The project will leverage the work of other NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) projects to build low cost mechatronics training kits and will disseminate the curriculum and materials it develops to the ATE community. As traditional manufacturing becomes more automated and dependent on computers, the need for technicians with advanced problem-solving skills is increasing.

In the atmosphere, eclipses generate disturbances in the neutral density (gravity waves) that can propagate long distances in both horizontal and vertical directions and carry significant amounts of energy. Gravity waves can also interact with and modify general atmospheric circulation (i.e. winds). While gravity waves generated during solar eclipses in the upper atmosphere are well documented, their counterparts at the tropospheric and stratospheric heights remain virtually unexplored. Recent observations during the Great American Eclipse of 2017 have produced new experimental information about stratospheric gravity waves (SGWs) generated by a solar eclipse. The 2019 eclipse in South America offers a unique opportunity to build on this work and obtain detailed physical characterization of eclipse-generated SGWs and explore their generation mechanisms. Balloon-borne radiosondes in coordination with the Andes Lidar Observatory in Cerro Pachon, Chile will be used to measure disturbance levels in the neutral atmosphere prior to, during, and after the eclipse. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project for 10 weeks during summer of 2019 including five weeks of training before the event, the week-long campaign in South America, and four weeks focusing on analysis of data collected during the event. The proposal would support a graduate student at the University of Montana to lead the data analysis effort and operate radiosonde systems. <br/><br/>The main objective of the 2019 campaign is to focus exclusively on stratospheric gravity wave measurements during an eclipse. Detection probability is enhanced with increased temporal resolution prior to the eclipse. The 2019 campaign is designed to have two balloons at various altitudes starting 24 hours before the eclipse, with at least one of the two balloons in the 25 - 35 km range every hour the night prior to the total darkness (totality). The timing of launches during the late afternoon of July 2nd will be based on phases of the eclipse. Unlike the Wyoming 2017 eclipse radiosonde campaign that focused on a specific atmospheric layer, the structure of the 2019 campaign along with collaborator data is expected to produce definitive evidence of and important physical information on eclipse-generated gravity waves. These data will fill the observational gap pertaining to gravity waves that are a known mechanism of momentum and energy transfer to atmospheric mean flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting volcanic activity must contend with magma transport processes that are hidden beneath the surface and that reflect an integrated history of magmatic and tectonic events spanning far beyond direct observational records. Magmatism of any kind associated with the largest volcanic eruptions in the geologic record has never been directly observed, which complicates efforts to understand how volcanoes active today fit into the spectrum of possible volcanic processes. This proposal will generate new understandings of magma transport on scales that are relevant both to predicting active volcanic processes and to interpreting the record of past eruptions. Broader impacts associated with this proposal will leverage the great diversity of volcanic data to develop sonification and visualization software tools for use in teaching, outreach, and as a bridge to the arts. Undergraduate teaching and workshops will generate geoscience education materials. A series of outreach presentations will use sonification and visualization techniques to bring project research to the public, including a collaboration with musicians to produce recordings and performances of sonified volcanic data. <br/><br/>There are two primary scientific objectives of this proposal. The first objective is to understand the spatiotemporal progression of magmatism at its largest scales, focusing on the iconic Columbia River Flood Basalts. New field data describing a massive exposed feeder dike system in eastern Oregon, USA, will be combined with thermochronology and related techniques that constrain timescales of subsurface magma flow. Numerical models will elucidate physical processes controlling the tempo, volumes, and crustal transport architecture feeding flood basalt eruptions, using Bayesian inversion methods to formally assess model uncertainty amongst diverse but indirect observational constraints. This work should provide a predictive basis for connecting flood basalt eruptions to environmental impacts including climate and mass extinctions of life. The second objective is to develop a modeling framework for crustal magma transport that captures multiphase fluid movement and surface eruption cycles through a network of reservoirs and conduits, coupled to a crustal model that accounts for the thermomechanical history of prior magmatism, far-field forcing (i.e. from tectonics, climate), and nonlinear rheology of crustal materials. This modeling framework will be used to explore the phenomenological trade-offs in physical and chemical processes that govern eruption cycles, and explore the complexities of history-dependent crustal stress and thermal evolution at long-lived magmatic centers. Applications to historical volcanic datasets as well as the Columbia River Flood Basalts will provide an observational test for models, while comparison to and calibration with fully phase-resolved simulations performed by others will help bridge divergent approaches to modeling multi-scale magma transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When more aerosols are present clouds tend to have a larger number of smaller droplets, making them brighter and more effective in reflecting sunlight back to space. Thus increases in aerosol amount due to industrial activity can increase the brightness of clouds, resulting in a cooling effect on climate.  The extent to which the global temperature increase from greenhouse warming has been offset by human-induced radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud-interactions (RFaci) is an important and unsolved problem in climate science.<br/><br/>One obstacle to progress on RFaci is the difficulty of performing computer simulations which explicitly represent cloud properties yet cover the whole earth, so that global climatic effects can be assessed. Cloud motions are turbulent and require models with grid points spaced a fraction of a kilometer apart, while global model grid spacing is typically tens to hundreds of kilometers.  To bridge this scale gap the PIs have developed an ultraparameterized (UP) model, meaning a global model with coarse grid spacing in which each grid box contains a fine-scale cloud resolving model with a domain size much smaller than the grid box.  The model is challenging both scientifically and computationally, and the project includes a concerted effort to improve computational efficiency to make simulations practical.<br/><br/>The research addresses several specific questions regarding RFaci.  One question is why climate models tend to overestimate RFaci compared to estimates from satellites, in some cases by a factor of two. Comparisons between the UP model and satellite observations will be facilitated by a nudging methodology, in which external forcing is used to constrain the simulated weather patterns to match the days when the satellite observations were taken.  The nudging minimizes differences between simulated and satellite-estimated RFaci due to incorrect simulation of large-scale circulation features, allowing attribution of differences to aerosol-cloud interactions.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the societal implications of high versus low RFaci: if the cooling effect of industrially-driven RFaci is large, the strength of greenhouse warming must be at the high end of current estimates in order to explain the warming seen over the past century.  Likewise, if industrial RFaci cooling was small over the last century, the sensitivity of global temperature to greenhouse gas increase is likely to be on the lower end of its estimated range. RFaci is thus among the largest uncertainties in determining climate sensitivity and the severity of climate change impacts. In addition, software developed under the project is made available to the research community, in part through a version of the Community Earth System Model.  The project provides support and training for a postdoctoral research scholar, thereby providing workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There, at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), small enigmatic structures of tens of km in size were recently observed on the mantle side. The CMB is a critical boundary. The heat conducted away from the core by mantle materials contributes to power the Earth's magnetic field which shields us from the solar wind. Mantle thermal convection, which drives plate tectonics and associated hazards, might have brought unique materials to the CMB; possibly large sections of the Earth's crust and upper mantle. Characterizing the newly observed structures is important, because they hold clues on the planet dynamics, chemical evolution and present-day state. Here, the researchers use seismology - the study of seismic-wave propagation within the Earth - to image and characterize these structures. They are called ultra-high velocity zones, because seismic waves passing through them exhibit remarkably high velocities. To identify their origins, the team studies the convective properties of the mantle using geodynamic modeling. The researchers also carry out experiments and computational calculations to investigate the properties of candidate materials at the extreme pressure and temperature of the deep mantle. These data help to constrain and interpret seismic observations, lifting the veil on the nature of ultra-high velocity zones. This project provides support to an early-career scientist, a postdoctoral associate and two female graduate students. It also promotes training for an undergraduate student and educational outreach to the public at yearly events and via the internet. <br/>  <br/>This multidisciplinary project frames the detection, imaging, modeling, and characterization of ultra-high velocity zones (UHVZs). The team's preliminary work finds them in spots beneath the Cocos and Caribbean tectonic plates, a region located beneath past and present active subduction zones. The researchers focus on mapping and modeling UHVZs there and in other geographical locales, analyzing seismic waves that reflects off of Earth's core (named ScS, ScP, and PcP waves). In addition, they explore compositional possibilities by performing high-pressure experiments and calculations. These involve materials introduced from above, such as subducted ocean crust and sediments, and from below (core-mantle interactions). Experiments on phase relations and properties of minerals are carried out using multi-anvil press and diamond-anvil cell setups at synchrotron national facilities. They explore a large range of pressure, up to the extreme pressure of 135 GPa (~1.3 million atm) prevailing in the lowermost mantle. Experiments are combined with calculations leading to estimates of expected velocities, which are compared with seismological results. In parallel, geodynamic modeling investigates the dynamical behavior of compositional input from subduction or the CMB. This provides a framework guiding the experimental work and the interpretation and modeling of seismic observations. UHVZs may have important effects on a number of deep mantle phenomena, including heat and chemistry exchange between the core and mantle. They may relate to important geodynamical cycles at the origin of the previously documented ultra-low velocity zones and/or thermochemical piles. Investigating the newly discovered CMB structures may provide insights on larger scale processes, like whole mantle convection and the evolution of mantle chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That feature is known as topological protection. Quantum mechanics is responsible for the exceptional properties of topological materials. Consider, for example, electrons, which in reality do not have constituent particles. In certain topological matter, they appear as if they have split into particles, called anyons, which also carry an equally distributed fraction of the original electric charge. These anyons are promising for building the fundamental components of a quantum computer, in which topological protection would help reduce otherwise unavoidable computational errors introduced by the material's interaction with its environment. <br/><br/>The PI will develop theoretical approaches for understanding quantum topological materials and their properties. Recent breakthroughs in experiments have uncovered how heat travels through topological matter. A major goal of this project consists of providing a theoretical understanding of quantum heat transport, and also resolving tensions between the existing theoretical framework and the newest experimental data on the behavior of quantum topological matter in two dimensions.<br/><br/>The research will advance fundamental understanding of topological matter and quantum transport, both of which are directions of crucial importance for quantum science and technology that have become a national priority.

The non-Abelian fractional statistics of anyons in topological matter may find significant applications in quantum information storage and processing. The understanding of non-Abelian statistics and many other phenomena in topological matter requires experimental access to neutral excitations, which comes from thermal transport experiments. <br/><br/>The first research direction is motivated by recent experimental developments and aims at achieving theoretical understanding of thermal equilibration and transport on the edges of quantum Hall liquids, including the effects of upstream neutral modes. The closely related second direction addresses poorly understood quantum Hall states in the second Landau level in GaAs and related systems. The observation of half-integer quantized thermal conductance at filling factor 5/2 strongly supports the existence of non-Abelian anyons in the second Landau level. Yet, many open problems remain, including an apparent conflict between the existing experimental results and numerics. The research builds upon recent experimental results and the breakthrough work by Son on the relation of 2D electron gases and topological insulators. The objective is to reconcile the theory of the 5/2 state with experiments. A third research direction focuses on newly developed topological systems with neutral modes but without charged modes. The methods employed will include a combination of analytical and numerical tools. <br/><br/>The research will advance fundamental knowledge of topological matter and quantum transport, both of which are directions of crucial importance for quantum science and technology that have become a national priority.

This project aims to broaden participation in engineering through outreach programs, public lab tours, the development of a new hands-on course, and the mentoring of underrepresented students.<br/><br/>In order to create handheld robotic devices, this project will take a human-focused approach to design and control through three main technical components. First, a model of the handheld device that incorporates the dynamics of the human hand, along with fatigue models for various muscle groups in the hands and arms will be developed. These models will help inform the device design. Second, the efficiency and accuracy of different strategies for both steering the instrument, as well as for mapping hand movement to instrument movement, will be evaluated. Third, flexible strain sensors will be incorporated for measuring task-critical force information that will then be displayed to the operator using haptic feedback in the form of directional cues. The optimal feedback parameters, along with the effectiveness of haptic feedback in improving task performance, will be measured. By developing a human-focused design approach, this work will expand our understanding of human-robot interactions for classes of robots beyond telerobots and can provide guiding principles for creating new robots with applications beyond surgery and healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In biological research, mass spectrometry is used in the analysis of protein (""proteomics"") and metabolic (""metabolomics"") data, while in non-research areas it is deployed, for example, to detect bomb-associated chemicals in routine airport security screenings. This research addresses three unmet needs in the processing of the data from mass spectrometry machines: The first is statistical identification of proteins in a biological sample; this is important for understanding what makes cells different, e.g., what makes a skin cell different from a blood cell. The second is identification of which biological species are in a sample; this is crucial in applications such as, for example, enabling accurate and automated disease diagnostics. The third is finding the ""alphabet"" of basic molecular ingredients in a sample. This research addresses these aims by developing new algorithmic and statistical methods that can correctly separate the basic elements of a complex mixture. The researchers working on this project create mathematical tools that are implemented as researcher-friendly software tools for solving the listed problems. To help make the ideas more accessible to both scientific and non-scientific audiences, the researchers will create teaching modules and podcast episodes to explain how the algorithms work, and what math tricks were developed to break down the complexity of the problem so it is amenable to a useful solution.<br/><br/><br/>Problems with combinatorial dependencies are ubiquitous in mass spectrometry. Symmetries in combinatorial dependencies can be exploited to construct special dynamic programming algorithms: convolution trees, fast numeric max-convolution, and other approaches, all of which were invented and developed by the researchers. The researchers will use and improve these symmetry-exploiting algorithms to implement superior mass spectrometry-based protein identification, species classification, and small molecule analysis. Convolution trees can be used to solve these problems in quasilinear time, and so they can be applied to a very large number of proteins, species, or small molecules (or to a large number of spectra from any of these problems). The researchers will construct a library of software implementations of these algorithms with permissive open source licensing for unrestricted academic and industrial use. As they further develop these combinatorial methods, the researchers will create a combinatorics curriculum for intuitively teaching these concepts to K-12 students and create podcast episodes explaining these ideas in an accessible manner.The fruits of this research will be freely available at https://alg.cs.umt.edu/nsf-career.html .<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ROIs are important in synthetic chemistry and are critical to understanding the aging processes in biology and in the environment. This research seeks to resolve mechanistic questions in ROI chemistry by using newly synthesized micro- and nanoparticles. Further scientific impact comes from designing materials which are resistant to aging caused by exposure to light and oxygen. The project supports training of research students.  Professor Greer cultivates STEM talent and enthusiasm for the sciences within a wider and younger audience by expanding the American Society of Photobiology's program ""Photobiology for Kids"", among other educational efforts in collaboration with Brooklyn College?s Annual High School Chemistry Day. <br/> <br/>Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs; oxygen radicals and singlet oxygen) are prevalent in the field of aerobic photochemistry, but they have proven extremely difficult to study. Many primary light-dependent and secondary ROIs generation events remain undefined. At present, photosensitization has been used with conventional methods of production, such as homogeneous solution, which leads to complex mixtures of ROIs. This research seeks to understand the downstream reactions that follow initial photooxidation events and to control the oxidation of natural and synthetic molecules, to reduce toxicity to organisms and damage to materials, and to develop new methods for disinfection of water supplies.  This fundamental research may also lead to new processes for the rapid photodegradation of plastics in landfills and oceans.  New heterogeneous methods for the photogeneration of reactive oxygen intermediates are investigated, allowing the ROIs to be rationally manipulated with effective tuning of reactivity. The research provides a method for phase separation that facilitates the deconvolution of complex photochemical processes.

Among the hazards driven by weather patterns, ground deformation due to landslides has immense global impacts. Large portions of the Earth's surface are at risk to ground failures, affecting a considerable fraction of the world's population. Landslides cause a global annual death toll of several thousand and financial losses of more than $1B per year in the United States alone. The most formidable challenge in predicting ground failures derives from their ability to suddenly accelerate despite the lack of observed precursors. In fact, natural slopes can deform in multiple ways, sometimes by displaying slow movements, while at other times moving rapidly in a fluidized state. Such modes of deformation coexist at the same site, affect portions of terrain proximal to one another, and may be experienced by the same hillslopes at different times. The current scarcity of predictive large-scale ground deformation models is largely a consequence of the poor spatial coverage of ground-based monitoring data. To overcome these obstacles, this project will rely on technological advances in remote sensing that allow the detection of rainfall patterns and ground movements at spatiotemporal resolutions that were unthinkable just a decade ago. These observational advances have the potential to unleash new formulation, calibration and validation possibilities for hydrologic and ground deformation models by means of abundant, openly-available, spatially-distributed information. Specifically, the project is motivated by the idea that pre-failure deformations have much to say about when, how, and why ground failure occurs, and aims to demonstrate that analyzing the deformation signature of the ground is the key to explain why hillslopes fail in different ways when subjected to variable weather patterns. If successful, this project will lead to new ways to decode the physical origin of ground instability and define measurable precursors of catastrophic landslide triggering, thus potentially inspiring the design of innovative real-time early warning systems able to better protect human life and infrastructure. <br/><br/>During the course of this project, the interaction between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere will be studied from a new multi-disciplinary perspective. Specifically, the project will formulate: (1) rheological laws for geomaterials able to explain variations in landslide velocity resulting from dynamically changing environmental conditions; (2) a multiscale weather-hydrology simulation platform able to quantify spatially heterogeneous rainfall inputs and soil moisture at the scale of mountain ranges; (3) landscape-scale geomechanical models able to reproduce the evolution of remotely sensed deformations via force-transfer laws between proximal portions of terrain; (4) a network theory for surface processes based on the physics of complex systems, by which patterns can be identified and precursors of runaway instability defined. Such a combination of methods will provide a comprehensive representation of landslide dynamics, thus improving our ability to forecast landslides and mitigate hazards at the landscape scale. Most importantly, it will provide innovative tools to address open questions in the domain of hazard forecasting, such as: (i) Can we use landscape-scale observations to infer the rheology of hillslopes? (ii) Which landscape-scale measurements are most useful for predicting the fate of incipient landslides? (iii) Is the concurrent collection of spatially-distributed data of rainfall patterns and displacement rates sufficient to identify landslide precursors? These questions will be answered by combining data from state-of-the-art remote sensing tools (e.g., satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar, high-resolution digital elevation models, and weather radar) with physics-based constitutive laws for soil and rock deformation, atmospheric-hydrologic models, and complex network theories. Rich datasets available for a variety of geological settings and earthen materials within and outside the United States will be used to test the predictive capabilities of the proposed approaches. This strategy will offer unique opportunities to validate the concepts at the core of the project and test their applicability to a wide range of geomorphic and climatic contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to efficiently handle the increasing amount of data, current data management systems are designed to support massive parallelism by scaling effectively to thousands of computing units. A critical component in the success of these systems is that they partition the input instance in specific layouts prior to processing. The goal of the partitioning is to improve data locality, i.e., data that is often processed together should be located in the same physical machine. Modern distributed large-scale systems adopt several types of simple partitioning schemes, but the simplicity of these schemes limits the data locality that can be achieved. This project aims to study - both theoretically and in practice - how more advanced partitioning strategies can further accelerate parallel query processing and speed up the data-to-knowledge pipeline in various applications across multiple domains. It will rethink data partitioning from the ground up, and examine it in a more holistic framework in the context of modern data processing.<br/><br/>This project aims to perform an end-to-end investigation of how the design of advanced data partitioning techniques can impact both exact and approximate parallel query processing. To achieve this research goal, this project focuses on three interconnected directions. The first thrust focuses on establishing formal foundations for data partitioning techniques, and study how partitioning theoretically impacts exact query processing. In particular, this thrust will investigate the theoretical tradeoffs between system parameters such as storage overhead, workload balancing, and efficiency for query execution over the partitioned instance. The second thrust will explore how approximate query processing can be benefited from smart partitioning methods as well. Finally, the third thrust will develop and implement novel partitioning strategies that aim to fill design gaps in existing techniques and address some of the drawbacks of existing partitioning techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Comparison of many pairs of species in this group will uncover the genetic changes responsible for and the evolutionary forces at work that generated reproductive isolation. Understanding the interactions between genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes that lead to species diversification will also contribute to agricultural breeding programs. The project includes efforts to educate grade school and high school students about evolution and the value of species diversity, and train undergraduate and graduate students in evolutionary biology and the molecular genetics of development.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on the evolution of F1 hybrid seed inviability, a relatively unstudied but potentially common reproductive barrier in flowering plants. This project integrates phylogenetic, population genetic, developmental, transcriptomic, and genome mapping approaches to systematically address whether hybrid seed failure is a key isolating mechanism driving population and species diversification across the genus Mimulus. The project will test the hypothesis that this form of reproductive isolation evolves rapidly via natural selection generated by parent-offspring conflict in all outbreeding flowering plant species. Such conflict-driven selection is expected to cause divergent evolution of the genetic control of endosperm development in seeds in different lineages via differential genomic imprinting, quickly leading to strong postzygotic isolation regardless of the ecological environments that the species experience. The main goals of this project are to determine the rate of evolution, strength, and importance of hybrid seed inviability in the speciation process across the genus Mimulus; to assess the developmental mechanisms and transcriptomic signatures of hybrid seed inviability, and finally to determine the genetic basis of hybrid seed inviability and the degree of parallelism in the genetic basis of speciation in this genus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind pollination has evolved repeatedly from insect pollination in flowering plants, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Shifts to wind pollination from animal pollination and to separate sexes (dioecy) from hermaphroditism represent major evolutionary transitions in flowering plants. Early progress in understanding the evolution of wind pollination was made in a plant genus where multiple origins of wind pollination from insect-pollinated ancestors is accompanied by the separation of sexes and the duplication of genomes, also known as polyploidy. Thalictrum are herbaceous perennials with great diversity of flower morphology, sexual system, and pollination mode amongst its circa 200 temperate species growing worldwide. Although polyploidy has a long history of recognized relevance to the evolution of plants, and a demonstrated contribution to increased species diversity, few studies have examined whether polyploidy is associated with shifts in pollinators or sexual system. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the processes contributing to changes in plant reproduction, with potential applications to agriculture, where alternative pollination vectors may be needed due to shortage of insect pollinators, and separate sexes are useful in the production of hybrid seed.<br/><br/>This study seeks to investigate the order of trait evolution and the phylogenetic patterns of trait-dependent species diversification in a diverse angiosperm lineage where evolutionary transitions in ploidy level, sexual system and pollination mode have occurred repeatedly. Thalictrum (Ranunculaceae) is an ideal system in which to study the tempo and mode of evolution of these ecological shifts, as they have occurred repeatedly, allowing for multiple comparisons. The broader questions addressed by this study are: 1) What is the effect of polyploidy, sexual system and pollination mode on net diversification rates? Do polyploidy and animal pollination promote speciation? Is dioecy an evolutionary ""dead end""?; and 2) What is the order of character evolution? Is transition to unisexual flowers more likely in a wind pollinated background or did unisexual flowers evolve first? Are either of these more likely in a polyploid background? This interdisciplinary research will make use of phylogenetic comparative analyses to uncover trait-dependent species diversification that will inform future evolutionary development experiments aimed at uncovering the genetic basis underlying independent shifts to wind pollination, dioecy and polyploidy and at determining whether these evolved through same or different genetic mechanisms each time, i.e., is it a case of parallel or convergent evolution?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reducing and managing risks from storm surge are challenging because of the complex nature of the hazard and the inherent uncertainty in storm surge forecasting. Weather forecasters and emergency managers often use maps and animations (visualizations) to communicate storm surge risks and threats to the public. However, little is known about how these visualizations influence people's understanding and response to risk. This project will contribute to research on visualizations and how well these work for the communication of hazardous weather risks.  By focusing on attachment to place within the context of coastal communities, the investigators will improve understanding of how people interact with information about coastal hazards and what role visualizations play in understanding and decision-making. The investigators will engage with practitioners and stakeholders throughout the project, from the planning stages to dissemination of the research results, ensuring project relevancy and building strong societal benefit for the needs of affected communities. This project will support educational activities through interdisciplinary training of students and faculty at a variety of institutions including from minority serving colleges and universities. The project will contribute to broader efforts to increase public scientific literacy by focusing on the role of visualizations in communicating complex scientific concepts in a relatable and usable manner. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to fundamental theoretical and methodological advances in geography, geospatial science, cartography, as well as decision, risk and management science and their intersection with communication of hazardous weather risks.  The research will bridge the gap between how spatially explicit storm surge information is being conveyed by scientists and their interpretation and use by members of the public in at-risk coastal communities. The investigators will consider the role of concepts such as space and place in data representation and hypothesize that connecting people to place through theoretically and empirically informed visualizations will enhance at-risk populations' understandings of and responses to storm surge hazard threats.  The project's research questions are: How do residents of coastal communities perceive a sense of place in their everyday lives and when hazardous storm surge threatens? How can sense of place constructs be integrated into visualization of storm surge threats? How do different ways of representing space and place in storm surge visualizations interact with people's understandings of and responses to the hazards? The investigators will use a multi-method interdisciplinary approach that employs an experimental participatory cognitive mapping process, research on and development of innovative storm surge visualizations, iterative focus groups on risk perception and the degree to which attachment to place factors in to decision-making, and an online survey to test the impact of different types of visualizations.  Together this suite of methods will be able to inform how the visualizations, attachment to place, and other factors influence people's understandings of and responses to storm surge hazards.  The research includes stakeholder engagement in coastal areas and experts from several related government agencies. Although the project focuses on coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the methods, technology, and visualization concepts will be relevant to other coastal communities in the U.S. vulnerable to hurricane storm surge. Furthermore, the theories and empirical findings will be relevant to non-coastal communities by understanding how attachment to place within visualizations can be used to improve communication of risk hazards and decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of this research will involve graduate students, and will therefore contribute to the development of the next generation of gravitational astrophysicists.<br/><br/>The work supported by this grant will develop better mathematical methods for using observations of neutron stars and our understanding of strong gravitational fields to determine the neutron-star equation of state in a way that is free from any assumptions about the microphysics of neutron star matter.  Other projects include searches in the publicly available LIGO data for gravitational waves emitted by the r-modes of rotating neutron stars and new research in numerical relativity that involves developing techniques for solving Einstein's equations on manifolds with arbitrary spatial topologies. These methods will be used to study a variety of problems, including an effort to explore the gravitational analog of the turbulent cascade seen in fluid systems and exploring cosmological models numerically to determine whether and how non-trivial topology could be recognized through observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists still do not understand the process of how energy is transported from the solar wind throughout each of these layers of low-density, plasmas. This work investigates how these energy transport processes occur from the magnetosphere into the ionosphere. The project is relevant to the National Space Weather Action Plan since it will assist in identifying typical limits of ionospheric disturbances generated from extremes of observed space weather effects. These disturbances affect the orbits of satellites that can compromise tracking and operations of our US commercial and defense assets. An early career scientist and undergraduate researchers will be supported.<br/><br/>The shielding electric field generated due to charge separation associated with the Region-2 Field Aligned Currents (FAC) plays an important role in determining the dynamics of the coupled inner magnetosphere-ionosphere system. However, the paucity of global-scale measurements of field-aligned currents and electric fields in the sub-auroral region has restricted our understanding of the dynamics of inner magnetosphere shielding and several questions remain unanswered. Specifically, (1) To what extent is the paradigm of shielding valid?, (2) What are the timescales associated with shielding?, and (3) How do season and local time influence shielding? The overarching goal of this work is to answer these questions by using measurements from the NSF-funded Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) dataset to determine the imbalance between the Region-1 and Region-2 FACs as a proxy for the intensity of shielding. Specific tasks will focus on combining AMPERE FACs with electric fields from the mid-latitude Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) to determine the extent to which the paradigm of inner magnetosphere shielding by Region-2 FACs is valid and to determine the modulating influence of ionospheric conductivity and MLT on the magnitude, extent and timescales of over-/under-shielding electric fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bernhard Schlegel of Wayne State University is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program within the Chemistry Division.  He studies the interaction of intense laser light pulses with molecules to investigate chemical reactions that occur over a very short time scale (attoseconds, or quadrillionths of a second). The research is theoretical and computational in nature and is being carried out in close collaboration with experimental scientists who are testing the predictions of these theories in laser laboratories. Dr. Schlegel's investigations are revealing how light delivered in short, intense pulses can be used to follow the movement of electrons in molecules during chemical reactions, called electron dynamics.  Results of this fundamental study can provide details about the individual steps involved in a chemical reaction, its mechanism, which can aid in making chemical processes more efficient.  He conducts workshops to instruct student researchers on how to utilize computational chemistry software. The computer software developed during the project is available to the scientific community through Dr. Schlegel's website and is incorporated into general-purpose quantum chemistry computer codes. <br/><br/>The response of molecules to intense laser fields involves electron dynamics on a time scale as short as few hundreds of attoseconds and molecular dynamics at times of a few femtoseconds and longer. Methodologies to simulate these interactions are being developed for both time scales. Time-dependent configuration interaction methods with real space complex absorbing potentials (TDCI-CAP) and real-time integration of time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) are used to investigate electron dynamics and ionization of molecules in strong laser fields. Machine learning is being tested for predicting the angular dependence of strong field ionization from orbital energies, ionization potentials and the shapes of molecular orbitals, electrostatic potentials and electric field gradients. Born-Oppenheimer, extended Lagrangian and Ehrenfest dynamics are being used to simulate isomerization and fragmentation in cations by ultra-short, intense mid-infrared laser pulses. The involvement of excited states in strong field isomerization and fragmentation reactions is to be investigated with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Besides high ionic conductivity, ionic liquids exhibit low volatility, good thermal stability, low flammability, and a wide electrochemical window. These properties could enable safe energy storage devices with higher energy and power density and longer-term stability than is possible with current technologies. However, the performance of these devices depends on the viscosity of the ionic liquids in extremely narrow spaces, and their high viscosity has been linked to reduced electrical conductivity and capacitance, poor wetting of porous electrodes, and lower power density. Therefore, research that addresses the flow characteristics of nanoconfined ionic liquids is of paramount importance. This project will examine the relationship between liquid composition and flow behavior in nanoscale channels. Thereby, it will enable to establish design principles of ionic liquids as electrolytes for next-generation supercapacitor and battery technologies. The proposed research will also contribute to the development of the US work force by training two graduate research assistants at the intersection between materials chemistry and engineering, interfacial science, and rheology. This multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and benefit engineering education. <br/><br/>The research project will address three major issues in the flow of nanoconfined ionic liquids: the relationship between liquid structure and nanorheology, the effects of surface composition (wettability) and nanoscale roughness on material behavior, and the connection between electrostatic and viscous phenomena. The experimental study will use a surface forces apparatus by confining the liquids between two surfaces with controlled characteristics. Measurements of static and hydrodynamic forces as well as dynamic shear will be carried out on a set of judiciously selected ionic liquids with a wide range of compositions. The findings of these studies will be used to develop a framework to predict the rheology of nanoconfined ionic liquids. Furthermore, the knowledge generated by this research will enable practitioners to modulate the nanorheological response of ionic liquids through the precise control of their structure, surface wettability, roughness and potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER award seeks to study how the brain of a small worm detects information about its environment and transforms that information into actions. The worm's small brain makes it possible to study the flow of information as it traverses through the brain with a level of detail and completeness that is not currently possible in other more complicated animals. The investigation uses new approaches that the principal investigator developed to record activity of the worm's brain as it crawls. The results of this study will provide new insights into how brains flexibly process information and generate actions. The work is integrated with a comprehensive education and outreach plan. In one component, hands-on workshops will be held for public policy students to learn about genetic engineering and machine learning, two cutting-edge technologies that enable the proposed research and also have the potential to transform society.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate circuit-level mechanisms underlying sensorimotor processing in the nematode C. elegans.  The animal flexibly interprets sensory signals to drive motor outputs dependent upon internal state. In some states an applied mechanosensory signal will propagate through the network to elicit a motor response, while in other states it will not. This project uses whole brain calcium imaging at cellular resolution in freely moving C. elegans to map out the functional paths by which the sensory signals propagate. Specifically, the work seeks to locate where in the network mechanosensory signals transition into locomotory signals, and to identify where state information impinges on this path using a whole-brain approach. C. elegans, with its compact nervous system of only 302 neurons, optical transparency, genetic tractability and mapped connectome is well-suited to carrying out the investigation. Education and outreach components of this research grant target students of public policy, undergraduate physics and engineering students especially from underrepresented groups, and undergraduate neuroscience students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They cannot be run efficiently on general-purpose processors, which has led to an explosive growth in custom hardware accelerators for ML. However, getting good performance and energy-efficiency from these accelerators is itself challenging, as it relies on three components: the ML model itself, the hardware parameters, and the scheduling of computations in the ML model onto the limited compute and memory resources on the accelerator. The proposed research will develop an open-source software cyberinfrastructure called MAESTRO that can be used to analytically determine the performance and energy-efficiency of ML models over target hardware platforms, prior to actually building the hardware and deploying the model. MAESTRO will be extremely useful for students, researchers, and industry practitioners alike to learn about, design, and deploy custom ML solutions. The project will also engage undergraduate and high-school students to teach them about ML through outreach activities involving hackathons and hardware building.<br/><br/><br/>Mapping ML computations over finite compute elements within an accelerator, and understanding the corresponding data that needs to move across the memory hierarchy is a non-trivial problem; the space of all possible ways of slicing and dicing the model (known as ""dataflow"") is exponentially complex, and the benefits of any mapping vary across ML models and target accelerator. To address this, the PI will first develop a set of data-centric directives to directly describe the mapping of the ML model over the accelerator, which will enable precise calculations of data reuse opportunities across space and time to reduce overall data movement. Next, the PI will develop the MAESTRO analytical cost model framework to estimate reuse, end-to-end performance, and energy over the target hardware. Finally, a set of tools will be developed around MAESTRO to automatically search for and determine the optimal hardware/mapping/model given constraints of runtime, power, energy, or area.  The proposed framework will enable iterative innovation and co-design across the ML model, mapping and target hardware, and will therefore be highly valuable for ML model developers, compiler writers and computer architects. MAESTRO will be released and maintained on an open-source license, and the PI will run periodic tutorials to build an active user-base in the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, although recent advances in neuroprobes such as nanoelectrode arrays make it possible to pick up signals from single neurons, scaling the systems to thousands and possibly millions of neuron sites is not practical due the enormous resources and time required to digitize, store and analyze the vast amount of data. This proposal aims to precisely address these challenges by integrating an artificial neural network on the nanoelectrode array, such that cell signals picked up by the electrodes are directly processed by the artificial neural network, and only the processed, ""useful"" data need to be amplified and transmitted, allowing real-time analysis with very low power. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to obtain state-of-the-art nanotechnology and neuroengineering techniques. Knowledge and techniques developed during research will be incorporated into course materials and other types of publications to allow cross pollination for students among different disciplines and broad dissemination to the general public. <br/>The proposed new neural recording system will offer unparalleled spatial resolution and processing capabilities, where high density and highly sensitive nanoelectrode arrays are integrated with a memristor-based artificial neural network that allows real time signal processing. By optimizing and utilizing internal dynamic ionic processes in the memristors, the artificial network can be directly driven by the spike trains from biological neurons without amplification or other pre-processing, where responses from the memristor network can be used to analyze temporal patterns in the neuron spikes and to connect detected neuronal activity with functions of the biological networks. The tightly coupled memristor network with the biological network can further allow functions in the biological system to be directly mapped on the electrical system, and potentially lead to future neural prosthesis and augmentation applications. New materials, devices, and networks will be developed, along with new recording and computing strategies that broaden the impact of the proposed project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to answer a simple yet important question: how shall we build next-generation datacenters that are cost-effective and deliver good performance?<br/><br/>For decades, the unit of deployment, operation, and failure in datacenters has been a computer server, that contains all the hardware resources that are needed to run a user program.

As a result, there are huge energy and monetary wastes in today's datacenters and it is hard to incorporate new hardware innovations.<br/><br/>This project intends to break the traditional server model into fine-grained hardware resources. Instead of packaging hardware devices in a server and connecting servers with a network, future datacenters  will connect hardware devices directly to the network. Doing so makes it more flexible and cheaper to run applications and deploy new hardware. This project will build the software infrastructure for this new datacenter model. Through innovation, design, and development of the proposed infrastructure, this project will improve the flexibility and reduce the total cost of future datacenters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current modalities for treating pulmonary embolism are effective for most cases with the exception of the acute massive and submassive patients (45% of patients).  The company's product is particularly suited for the massive and submassive pulmonary embolisms, respectively 5% and 40% of PE population. Based on the approximately 150K PE patient cases per year, with an estimated $3000 per QuickFlow catheter, the company's estimated target market at minimum 4% penetration within the first three years is $18 million. QuickFlow addresses a severely underserved market; hence, maximizing the value to both the patient and physicians. The value propositions of faster (less than one-hour procedure), safer (no thrombolysis, no vessel wall damage and whole clot removal), easy and intuitive to use (similar mechanism of use to the existent device), and less procedure cost (1 day in ICU instead of 2-3 days), make it appropriate for several key markets, with a global market opportunity in excess of $1.53 billion by 2022.  The implications of this device for the thrombectomy device market and healthcare system can be significant in helping to treat underserved PE patients and reducing cost. <br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a mechanical blood clot removal device to address pulmonary embolism and restore blood flow in 30 minutes of patient?s arrival.

But at times the waves slow down and grow quite large, forming a ""block"" in the jet-level flow.  The blocked flow results in a stagnation of weather systems, which can lead to prolonged cold spells, excessive precipitation, and other forms of extreme weather.  Naturally blocking has been a topic of intensive research for some time, but a satisfactory explanation for it has been elusive. One reason is that that much of the relevant wave dynamics theory assumes that the waves have small amplitudes, which is not the case for blocking.  To remedy this mismatch the PI and his colleagues have developed a bulk measure of the waviness around a latitude circle called Finite Amplitude Wave Activity (FAWA), along with its longitudinally varying counterpart, Local Wave Activity (LWA, see AGS-1563307).  FAWA and LWA are well suited to the study of blocking because they can be applied throughout the lifecycle of a block, even when the blocking pattern is quite pronounced.<br/><br/>Recently the PI and his group developed a simple theory of blocking based on the relationship between mean jet speed and LWA.  The idea of the theory is that an increase in wave activity slows down the jet stream, which slows down the propagation of waves along the jet.  The slowdown leads to a pile-up of LWA which increases waviness and further slows down the jet. The formation of blocks by accumulation of LWA is analogous to the formation of a traffic jam, in which a slow-down on a highway leads to accumulation of cars which further slows highway speed until a jam is produced. The analogy is exact in the sense that the formation of a block by the piling up of LWA can be modeled using the classical traffic flow equation derived in papers from the the 1930s and 1950s.<br/><br/>Here the PI uses his traffic jam theory of blocking to perform a diagnostic study of wave-mean flow interactions leading to blocks, using concepts from traffic flow theory to understand block formation.  For instance the ""capacity"" of a jet stream, meaning the amount of LWA that can travel along a jet without initiating a slowdown in wave propagation, can be defined in analogy with the capacity of a highway for traffic.  Quantities like capacity can be easily calculated from weather maps and from model simulations.<br/><br/>Further work applies the FAWA/LWA framework to Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events, in which the stratospheric vortex circling the North Pole breaks down and stratospheric temperatures rise dramatically, sometimes over 100F within a few days. SSWs are thought to occur because the vortex is disrupted by upward-propagating waves, thus SSWs are a logical target for analysis using the FAWA/LWA framework.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the extreme weather associated with blocks and the impact it has on human activities.  Blocking events are difficult to predict, and simulations from state-of-the-art forecast models are generally deficient in blocking.  The understanding developed in this work may thus be important for improved simulation and prediction of blocking.  SSWs are equally challenging from a forecast perspective, and they can also affect surface weather in various ways.  Codes for the calculation of FAWA and LWA from meteorological data are made available to the research community via github to promote their adoption and use.  Education and outreach are conducted through a biennial summer school and a local community science center.  In addition, the project supports two graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, thereby fostering the next generation of scientists in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will use modern next generation genome sequencing approaches to analyze bird and parasite specimens and their DNA to reconstruct the genealogies and history of associations between these ancient birds and their parasites. This hyperdiverse tinamou-louse system is a model for studying broadly important patterns and processes that are critical for understanding parasite diversification and the history of colonization onto new hosts. Thus, the data analyzed for this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in our general understanding of the basic principles of host-parasite interactions and therefore has implications for better comprehension of the basic biological principles governing human parasite interactions. Undergraduate students, graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and three high school students will actively participate in the project and several of these trainees are from underrepresented groups. Project participants will also deposit high quality museum specimens and data into publicly available museum collections and databases. Lastly, project personnel will work with the Academy of Natural Sciences public education and exhibitions departments to participate in public outreach events and to develop an exhibit on parasite diversity and evolution.<br/><br/>This study will use next generation whole genome sequencing to collect DNA sequences of 9 genera and 47 species of partridge-like tinamous and eighteen genera of their feather lice (Phthiraptera: Philopteridae). Tinamou feather lice are the most diverse community of feather lice found on any avian host group. However, neither tinamous nor their lice have been well studied and there are no complete published genealogies available to reconstruct the history of their host-parasite interactions over deep time scales. This exceptionally high parasite diversity on one host lineage may be a product of the ancient history of tinamous, providing extensive time for parasite speciation, colonization, and back colonization. This project aims to reconstruct robust genealogies of the tinamous and their feather lice using whole genome DNA sequence data to untangle the cophylogenetic history of their host-parasite associations. The project plan includes four major objectives: (1) reconstruct the genealogy of tinamou feather louse genera, including other major feather louse lineages, to determine whether tinamou feather lice as a whole are each other's closest relatives and whether host-switching and back colonization between tinamous and other avian families is prevalent in this louse group's diversification; (2) reconstruct a genealogy of tinamou species; (3) reconstruct genealogies of tinamou feather louse species from 10 focal genera; and (4) conduct analyses of these genealogies and associated genetic data including (a) a comparison of the genealogies of tinamou feather lice with the tinamou host phylogeny, (b) a comparison of the rates of DNA change between tinamous and their lice, and (c) a test for correlation between host and parasite body size, which is well documented in the literature but has not been well tested.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

California, for example, is all too familiar with dangerous mudslides triggered by flash flooding on top of burn scars left over from prior drought conditions. The central U.S. is also no stranger to back-to-back expansive flooding episodes that drive destructive surges down the major rivers. These grouped events seriously test our ability to manage flood and drought and ensure protection of lives and property. Scientists do not fully understand the weather conditions that cause these grouped events. Nor do they know how good we are at forecasting them 2 weeks to 2 months in advance. Experts from insurance, reservoir design and emergency responders will gather with scientists to identify how these grouped events cause problems. This knowledge will then be used to craft the research necessary to support solutions. New scientific discoveries are anticipated about what causes floods and droughts to group together across the U.S. This new knowledge will then be used to develop ways to forecasts these grouped events 2 weeks to 2 months in advance. These new forecasting approaches will support our ability to prepare and reduce impacts. Through supporting enhanced protection of lives and livelihoods this project ultimately strengthens our national welfare and economic competitiveness. In addition to new science and better forecasts the project has a number of other potential benefits. The integration of research and education is central to the project, and will be achieved through the training and career development of the project team and one graduate student. The project is also committed to diversity and inclusion. Participation of underrepresented groups will be broadened through the mentoring of students underrepresented in science each summer. To promote additional scientific research the project will adhere to, and promote, best practices in open, accessible and reproducible science. The project will also engage non-scientists through a series of media interviews, newspaper/TV appearances, and science writing regarding the special risks to humans and environment posed by connected floods and droughts, and strategies to reduce their impacts. <br/><br/>The work is structured around three objectives: 1) Identify potentially connective regimes and formulate hypotheses about the underlying shared processes by applying statistical models to observation-based datasets of U.S. extreme wet and dry events; 2) Advance the hypotheses by conducting a targeted suite of multi-scale dynamical model experiments for at least six instances of connected events; 3) Understand shared predictability sources by developing and testing a suite of prototype sub-seasonal to seasonal statistical-dynamical forecast systems. Potential contributions include understanding the shared physical processes connecting extreme wet and dry events, demonstrating extended forecast capacity for wet and dry extremes using forecast systems that emphasize connecting processes, and transforming how scientists conceptualize extreme events. Key project outcomes include a physical-process based definition of connected extremes, and a novel generalized research framework that co-advances shared-process understanding and forecast capacity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alloying elements called 'solutes' in metallic materials can exist in different forms, or phases. The solutes are in solid solution phases if they are randomly distributed in alloys as individual atoms; they can also be in certain small particles or 'precipitate' phases if some solutes agglomerate together to form specific structures through typical nucleation and growth progresses. Mechanical properties of alloys depend on the phases of solutes. Generally, alloys in solid solution phases are soft and ductile, convenient for low-cost mechanical forming and fabrication; but alloys with certain precipitate phases can be much harder and, therefore, difficult for mechanical forming compared with their counterparts in solid solution phases, so they are usually achieved in alloy components at final product stages.  <br/><br/>7000 series aluminum alloys with zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg) as the major alloying elements have a high strength-to-weight ratio after proper precipitation hardening (similar strength but half of the weight compared with conventional steel). Their widespread implementation in the automotive industry as structural components can achieve vehicles with lightweight and high fuel efficiency. However, the solute solution phases in these alloys can quickly (~30 minutes) transform into precipitate phases to harden the alloys even at room temperature, making significant challenges of their low-cost forming and fabrication using current automobile manufacturing techniques. <br/><br/>This University of Michigan-General Motors collaborative GOALI project aims to apply an integrated computational, experimental and statistical approach to understand and control the early stages of solid-solution-to-precipitate transformation kinetics of 7000 series aluminum alloys. The key objective is to design new alloy chemistries to retard the nucleation and growth of early-stage precipitate phases at room temperatures. These early-stage precipitates are mainly solute clusters and Guinier-Preston (GP) zones, both of which are made of a small number (less than 1000) of solute atoms agglomerated together. Then these alloys can stay in soft solid-solution phases for a longer time, convenient for conventional automobile manufacturing techniques. In addition, the new alloy chemistries should not impede the final precipitation hardening at a higher temperature. The proposed research will potentially enable implementation of 7000 series aluminum alloys in the automobile industry, contributing to vehicle light-weighting and favorably impacting energy savings, sustainability, and competitiveness. The generated computational-experimental-statistical framework and new knowledge will be applicable to alloy design in general and thus accelerate material development for meeting future needs. The proposed teaching and training elements will enable an integrated-computational-materials-engineering (ICME) approach to be widely imparted to senior undergraduate and graduate students in materials major and champion outreach/education activities of K-12 students as well as opportunities for students of underrepresented groups to be engaged in start-of-the-art materials research.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>Nucleation and growth theories of precipitates in solids are key fundamental principles to guide the development and application of advanced age-hardenable structural alloys. However, the conventional theories fail to provide quantitative guidance for the development and processing of multicomponent commercial alloys, where nucleation and growth of precipitates can occur in multiple steps with substantial structural-composition transformations under the influence of defects. This gap between theory and practice limits the industrial applications of many commercial alloys that require special fabrication and manufacturing processes. For example, high-strength Al-Zn-Mg-based 7000 series alloys have severe formability limitations if stamped more than ~30 minutes after the solutionizing treatment. These limitations result from fast precipitate kinetics at room temperature ('natural aging'), mainly the nucleation and growth of solute clusters and Guinier-Preston (GP) zones that can act as nuclei for subsequent precipitates. Understanding and controlling these nucleation and growth processes can slow down natural aging, and thereby expand the room temperature forming window amenable to the sustainable manufacturing of 7000 series Al alloys and other lightweight high-strength materials in the automobile industry, which has a significant impact on vehicle mass reduction.<br/><br/>In this industry-university collaborative GOALI project, the applicants plan to apply an integrated theoretical, computational, experimental and machine learning approach to understand and control the nucleation and growth kinetics of solute clusters and GP zones in Al-Zn-Mg-based alloys. A multi-scale simulation framework based on first-principles calculations, atomistic simulations, and phenomenological hardening model will be constructed to quantitatively describe the solute clusters and GP zone kinetics and their effects on hardness increments. Alloys with the proposed solutes will be synthesized and subjected to thermal processing and indentation hardness tests to verify their natural aging kinetics. A combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy and computer image simulations will be used to characterize the solute clusters and fine precipitates to verify the nucleation and growth mechanisms. A statistical machine learning surrogate model will be constructed to speed up the search of alloy chemistries to retard natural aging with further experimental confirmations. <br/><br/>In this project, the research team proposes a transformative alloy design concept to tune the early-stage precipitation kinetics of complex commercial alloys by searching the trace solute elements to control the structures and compositions of solid clusters and GP zones beyond the role of individual atoms of trace solute elements. The research team also proposes an efficient routine to design advanced alloys with a large parameter space by applying the integrated computational, experimental and statistical machine learning methods.  Quantitative understanding of precipitate nucleation and growth kinetics in 7000 series Al alloys using the newly developing computational and experimental tools will facilitate the development of advanced nucleation and growth theories for generalized multicomponent alloy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, for some tropical cyclones, the maximum surface winds have been observed to be maintained or even increase over land. A particularly noteworthy case is given by Tropical Storm Erin over Oklahoma, which dramatically and unexpectedly intensified into a strong tropical storm as it approached Oklahoma City from the west, resulting in millions of dollars of wind-related damage. The few prior investigations into this phenomenon generally agree that the required energy is drawn from the underlying land surface. However, they disagree on the extent to which the energy is associated with land warmth versus wetness, as well as on the physical processes that allow for a sufficient amount of energy to be concentrated near the surface so that it can be transferred to the tropical cyclones. Furthermore, the ideas advanced by these previous studies have generally been developed using highly simplified numerical weather prediction model simulations, with few instances in which these ideas have been tested for actual tropical cyclones. Consequently, this project seeks to significantly advance basic understanding of the energetics supporting tropical cyclone maintenance and strengthening over land while rigorously testing this understanding for a large sample of observed events. A partnership with the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will support the professional development and academic persistence of an undergraduate scholar from a traditionally underrepresented background, helping to increase representation of minority individuals within the workforce pipeline in the atmospheric and related sciences.<br/><br/>This research tests three guiding hypotheses: remote surface energy exchange is the primary but not exclusive control on tropical cyclone intensity change over land; non-desert soils cannot be sufficiently warmed to result in sufficient upward enthalpy flux for tropical cyclone maintenance or intensification over land; and intensity change over land is equally sensitive to surface energy exchange and initial finite-amplitude atmospheric variability. Factor separation applied to idealized numerical simulations is used to test the first two hypotheses, whereas ensemble-initialized real-data simulations are used to test the applicability of the idealized simulation results to the real atmosphere. An expanded climatology of atmospheric and substrate properties associated with overland tropical cyclone maintenance and intensification is to support the numerical model simulations and advance knowledge of the environments in which these events occur. Through these activities, this research will reconcile competing theories regarding the thermodynamic processes necessary to support non- or weakly baroclinic tropical cyclone maintenance and intensification over land through quantifying the respective contributions of local and non-local land-surface energy exchange to overland tropical cyclone intensity change. Given the ongoing scientific debate regarding the surface latent heat flux magnitudes needed to permit tropical cyclone intensification over water, findings from the research will also advance knowledge of the energetics of the traditional overwater tropical cyclone intensification process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, superconductivity offers applications such as quantum computing to meet future computing needs and restoring the reliability of the power grid alongside increasing its capacity and efficiency. The discovery of oxide high temperature superconductors (HTSs) provides possibilities for superconductors in applications at liquid nitrogen temperature and presents a fascinating research topic due to their unusual electronic structure and layered crystalline structures which gives profound effects on their physical properties, especially Jc. Raising Jc in HTSs has been the focus of world-wide efforts in the field of applied superconductivity. Growth of nanoscale artificial pinning centers (APCs) provides a powerful approach to raise Jc in nanocomposites, and the method can be directly implemented to large-scale HTS devices for commercialization. This project investigates the strained interfaces, the key driving force in strain-mediated self-assembly of APCs and the determining factor of the APC's pinning efficiency and hence Jc in nanocomposites. The goal is to achieve controllable APCs with precisely designed morphology, orientation, density, and interfaces. The scientific knowledge developed through this project will broadly impact future electronic and electrical applications. Nanoscale control of interfaces applies to computing, sensing, catalysis, and energy production/storage. The integrated modeling-synthesis-characterization approach can be extended to a range of nanocomposites beyond HTSs including ferroelectric, multiferroic, magnetoelectrics and semiconductors to produce novel and unprecedented properties. Both undergraduate and graduate students are gaining the cutting-edge research experience in preparation for careers in science and engineering. Students, especially those from underrepresented groups, are recruited through on campus programs (such as Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site and APS Bridge programs), collaborators and alumni. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project focuses on understanding and manipulating interface strains towards controllable growth and high pinning efficiency of nanoscale artificial pinning centers (APCs) in REBa2Cu3O7 (RE-123, RE for rare earth elements Y, Gd, Sm, etc.), aiming at high critical current density (Jc) in a strong magnetic field (H) in the APC/RE-123 nanocomposites. The project has four topics. Topic 1 investigates the pinning efficiency of c-axis aligned one dimensional (1D) APCs, especially the effect of the strained interfaces on Jc and pinning force density Fp. Topic 2 explores schemes, particularly multilayered 1D nanocomposites by insertion of the Ca-substituted RE-123 spacers, for repairing the defective interfaces for enhanced pinning efficiency. Based on theoretical predictions, topic 3 searches for new 1D APCs with small diameters approaching the coherence length and self-repairing functionality. Topic 4 explores APCs of mixed morphologies for H-orientation independent Jc using microscopic control of the strain field in nanocomposites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Few people survive and many structures cannot withstand encounters with pyroclastic flows, making them the deadliest features generated from explosive volcanic eruptions. Dilute pyroclastic flows are particularly hazardous because they are less constrained to follow topography, making them much more unpredictable. These flows typically terminate when the ground hugging current becomes less dense than the surrounding atmosphere and reverses buoyancy, at which point it rises up to form ash-laden plumes.  Understanding the mechanism and rate of this buoyancy reversal, and ultimately the runout distance of these flows, is necessary for accurate hazard prediction and for interpreting deposits of past eruptions.  Likewise understanding the formation of buoyant plumes is necessary to understand the  aviation and ashfall hazards 100's of kilometers from the eruptions.  As the world's population continues to grow, deadly encounters with volcanic eruptions will increase rapidly, and thus scientists need to accurately predict their behavior, including impact force, runout distance, and buoyancy reversal in order to mitigate their hazards. In addition to those societal impacts, graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoc are supported by this award. Interactive tools and videos are also being developed around this work, to be distributed to K-12 educators as well as via the National Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>Because the destructiveness of pyroclastic flows inhibits direct measurements, this study will combine physical analog experiments with multiphase numerical modeling to establish how pyroclastic flow properties, dynamic pressures, and buoyancy evolve during travel.  Ground hugging flows can reverse their buoyancy if enough pumice and ash is deposited and/or if enough air is entrained and heated, expanding the flow.  At present, this reversal is often posited as an abrupt terminating condition for the progression of the flow on the ground.  Counter, however, to assumptions used in parameterized models, the processes that result in buoyancy reversal, entrainment and deposition, are heterogeneous and can alter concentration gradients as indicated by previous analog experiments, multiphase numerical models, and field evidence.  Indeed, previous approaches that treat such currents as uniform oversimplify entrainment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of flow dynamics.  As the behavior and runout of turbulent currents are strongly dictated by the development of buoyancy reversal, a better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between sedimentation and entrainment is needed to develop more realistic models. Experiments in the Experimental Volcanology Laboratory (Smithsonian Institution) will investigate how buoyancy evolves due to entrainment in stratified currents. Experiments using the Deep Water Basin in the Morphodynamics Laboratory (UT Austin) will investigate how entrainment evolves in stratified currents modified by particle settling. Each set of experiments will provide independent and crucial information about how instabilities develop and incorporate ambient fluid into stratified currents, and how these processes control the rate and location of buoyancy reversal and liftoff. Three dimensional data from the experiments will be directly compared to multiphase numerical simulations (UOregon) to validate stratification evolution and liftoff conditions under end-member scenarios. A suite of simulations will also be used to explore the mixing processes and mass balance during the initiation of liftoff in ways not possible with parameterized entrainment models. This study aims to investigate heterogeneous deposition and entrainment in turbulent, stratified, particle-laden currents using complementary analog experiments and multiphase numerical models to establish how pyroclastic flow properties, dynamic pressures, and buoyancy evolve during transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The project seeks to understand the connection between land and aquatic ecosystems in a warming Arctic. This scientific challenge has been identified by the international community and Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) field stations in the Arctic. The Arctic ecosystem is being altered rapidly and systematically as a result of the changing climate. One critical element of change is permafrost thaw, which allows previously trapped nutrients to 'leak' in Arctic landscapes, although there is little agreement about the ultimate fate of the leaked material. To fill this knowledge gap, the project will use continuous and geographically extensive monitoring of river water quality to reveal landscape features that influence nutrient release from land to streams. In addition, the fellow will enhance public awareness of unique but globally-significant Arctic ecosystems through the use of technology to bridge the field to classroom gap. Hosted at Michigan State University, the fellow will work in partnership with the Arctic LTER at Toolik Field Station and Kellogg Biological Station LTER.<br/><br/>The postdoctoral fellow will use existing and planned LTER data collection to integrate Arctic ecological understanding at the plot and watershed-scales. The project will create a number of research products with broad interest to hydrologists, ecologists, and biogeochemists, including: 1) Analyses of synoptic and continuous data of catchment hydrology and hydrochemistry that have not yet been applied to the Arctic, and 2) Improved fundamental understanding of Arctic ecosystem 'hotspots' for nutrient fluxes. Further, the research is integrated with an education plan aimed at increasing participation of under-represented groups in Arctic research in three stages: 1) Developing K-12 lesson plans in partnership with Kellogg Biological Station Teacher Training Workshops, 2) Publishing these teaching plans as open-source Data Nuggets, and 3) Reaching K-12 classrooms through the free and broad-reaching 'Skype a Scientist' program. The project will expand current efforts at Michigan State University and the Arctic LTER aimed at understanding hydrochemical fate and transport, and will directly link to the Kellogg Biological Station LTER's outreach mission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New workloads are generated by social feeds, sensor readings (a common use-case of Internet-of-Things applications) and electronic micro-payments (an emerging model of e-commerce). They all have in common: (i) a very high volume of transactions and (ii) a high volume of analysis queries that need to use both historic and real-time data to provide useful and actionable insights. The primary challenge is that these workloads have conflicting requirements, and typically use different data systems architectures. On the one hand, we want to be able to answer analysis queries like, ""what was the most discussed topic in each month of the past year?"", or ""what is the average power consumption per neighborhood of city X?"". On the other hand, we want to efficiently store incoming updates and be able to provide real-time insights like ""where do we have a power network overload now?"", or ""what is the probability that a disaster is taking place based on the social feeds of a city X?"". Traditionally, data systems were engineered to efficiently support either a transactional workload -- that is, storing quickly new items -- or an analytical workload. The latter typically includes changing the data layout and organization, and building auxiliary indexing structures to allow for efficient data access. The emergence of complex workloads has pushed towards the need to develop new systems that can support hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP). This research will allow to execute such workloads efficiently and to anticipate workload changes in a robust way. Ultimately, the project will make data ingestion and data analysis a smoother process and will enable complex applications to have their data analyzed quickly.<br/> <br/>The researchers will build data systems that can efficiently evaluate mixed workloads by navigating the read-optimized vs. update-optimized continuum of data systems architectures. The key to do so is to vary the physical data organization and find the optimal for each use-case. Typically, data objects are physically organized in various ways between two extremes: either they follow the ingestion order, that is, the way they are generated or inserted in the system, or they are organized based on their value (or a specific subset of their attributes). This ""structure"" (also called ""bounded disorder"" in the literature) is treated as a continuum between the two extremes. In-between, hybrid data organizations have different parts of the dataset organized with different schemes. Transactional updates add data with disorder, while answering analytical queries efficiently requires data with bounded disorder. A fundamental challenge today is to find the data organization that enables a data system to offer a tunable balance between efficient updates and fast analysis queries. This project addresses this challenge from three different angles. First, by formulating an optimization problem, which can be solved at run-time. Second, by formulating a robust optimization problem which will deliver good performance even when preliminary assumptions are not accurate. Third, by building access methods that can exploit any inherently limited disorder in the underlying data to reduce the data organization effort needed for efficient analysis tasks. This research effort introduces HTAP data systems that can optimally organize data and exploit inherently bounded disorder while being robust in workload changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Most animals have mitochondrial DNA on a single chromosome. However, some species of parasitic lice have their mitochondrial DNA separated onto multiple chromosomes. It is not known how or why such a rare condition is maintained in lice. The fellow seeks to address this knowledge gap by testing whether differences in mitochondrial genome architecture (that is, single vs. multiple chromosomes) are linked to natural selection and speciation, the processes largely responsible for generating biodiversity. To this end, the fellow will rely on museum collections to compare DNA sequences and body measurements of lice species that have multiple mitochondrial chromosomes to those that have a single chromosome. This work will help answer a particularly puzzling question in biology while simultaneously showing a mechanism that generates biodiversity. The project will also include educational components that promote biodiversity among general audiences at both local and national scales.<br/><br/>The fellow will use multiple lines of evidence obtained from museum specimens to specifically address whether fragmented mitochondrial chromosomes act as a buffer to speciation via mito-nuclear incompatibility. First, the fellow will compare phylogenetic diversity, mutation rates, and genomic selection in two groups of avian lice that are known to have different mitochondrial architectures: wing (fragmented chromosomes) and body (single chromosomes) lice from doves. Lower mutation rates but higher diversification, divergence, and selection in body lice would suggest that single mitochondrial chromosomes promote speciation. Second, the fellow will test mutation rates and levels of selection in cryptic species of lice. Cryptic species have indistinguishable morphological differences but are highly divergent genetically. If pairs of cryptic body louse species have inseparable morphology with high genetic divergence and signatures of positive selection, whereas cryptic wing louse species do not, this would again indicate that single chromosomes promote speciation. The fellow will receive extensive training in morphology-based inquiry and genome evolution. This project will also include a component for training Purdue University undergraduate students in molecular/bioinformatic methods. Additionally, results from the work will be incorporated into lesson plans, outreach displays, and educational publications focused on evolution and biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elementary and middle school instruction is critical for fostering student interest in STEM subjects at early stages, and mathematics lies at the core and foundation of most STEM fields. However, many elementary and middle school teachers feel unprepared and lack confidence in teaching mathematics. This project will specifically respond to this need. The work will be done through a collaboration between the Mathematics Department and the College of Education at TAMU and in partnership with the Grand Prairie Independent Scholl District. It will provide solid preparation in mathematics and pedagogy that are aligned with school mathematics. Noyce Scholars will have opportunities to work with K-8 students through the mathematics department Summer Education Enrichment Math Camp and academic year Math Circle. Clinical practice in high-need schools will be provided through a partnership with the Grand Prairie Independent School District and other high-need schools. All TAMU Noyce Scholars at the undergraduate level will obtain a baccalaureate degree in mathematics as well as teacher certification upon graduation.  Individuals who already have a STEM degree will be supported in a post-baccalaureate year as they complete teacher licensure.<br/><br/>Over the five-year duration of the award, the project aims to produce 37 new, certified mathematics teachers who will teach in high-need elementary and middle schools in urban and rural regions of Texas. The project will recruit potential Noyce Scholars through multiple channels: 1) by providing informal teaching experiences to potential first and second year STEM undergraduates and STEM post-baccalaureates to gain initial teaching experience; 2) by working with Blinn College, Houston Community College, Lone Star College and the University of Houston to provide information for prospective teachers interested in coming to Texas A&M University; and 3) by utilizing the expansive network of the Association of Former Students to contact former STEM graduates of Texas A&M. The project will provide a strong mathematical and culturally responsive pedagogical training. This is particularly important in Texas where 68.5% or more teachers have no major or certification in mathematics and more than 65% of the school age population are students of color.

Through this specific binding, antibodies become highly active drugs with reduced side effects. The market for biopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies, is growing rapidly, with worldwide sales expected to reach $125 billion by 2020. The growing demand for antibodies and related biologics has driven up the cost of treatment using these products. As a result, the biopharmaceutical industry is increasingly under pressure from regulators, healthcare providers, and consumers to decrease production and treatment costs. Purification of monoclonal antibodies during bioprocessing is both slow and costly, representing more than 80% of the manufacturing expense. Membrane adsorbers are emerging as more efficient separation systems compared to conventional resin column beds in downstream biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Membrane adsorbers can be operated with much higher flow rates and throughput and, thus, are ideally suited for reducing processing times and production costs. The overarching goal of the EAGER project is to build the foundation for a new generation of macroporous membrane materials and modules that overcome the capacity, selectivity, and throughput limitations of existing commercial membrane adsorbers. To achieve this goal, functional polymers with high protein binding capacity and selectivity will be coupled with high surface area macroporous ceramic scaffolds, which can be configured into scalable modules for continuous bioprocessing. <br/><br/>Within the biopharmaceutical manufacturing community, the desired transition to precisely targeted therapeutics based on monoclonal antibodies (mAb) depends on dramatically increasing manufacturing speed and reducing production costs. Although membrane chromatography has demonstrated advantages over standard column chromatography, including higher throughput and lower cost, it is limited by low protein binding capacity and selectivity of commercial membrane adsorbers as well as complex module configurations and fabrication. Consequently, there is a critical need for a new generation of membrane adsorber materials that can be readily configured into scalable modules with high binding capacity and selectivity. This project seeks to build a foundation for the next generation of scalable membrane adsorber materials and modules for downstream biopharmaceutical manufacturing that overcome the limitations of existing commercial membranes. This EAGER project will focus on achieving two specific objectives: the design, preparation, and characterization of 1) salt-tolerant membrane adsorbers with high protein binding capacity for mAb purification; and 2) membrane adsorbers for selective mAb capture and recovery from bioreactor harvests. The strategy to establish the foundation for these membrane adsorbers relies upon the design of a family of macroporous ceramics with tunable pore size, structure, and morphology using directional solution freeze casting. Building upon the porous scaffolds, a two-pronged approach will be undertaken. Firstly, in-situ polymerization and phase-separation micromolding will be employed to prepare functional polymer microgels inside macroporous ceramic scaffolds that contain high concentrations of ligands with large protein binding capacity and selectivity. Secondly, conformal microgel coatings of highly tortuous dendritic pores will be prepared to provide hydrodynamic trapping and adsorption sites inside macroporous scaffolds. Fundamental understanding of the material preparation and functionalization process and protein binding capacity and selectivity will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There, pressure and temperature exceed 1.3 million atm and 3500 K (5840 degree Fahrenheit). Understanding its properties is critical to constrain the planet dynamics. The lower mantle conducts heat away from the outer core. This contributes to power the Earth's magnetic field which shields us from the solar wind. Furthermore, thermal convection in the mantle drives plate tectonics and associated hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Seismology, the study of seismic (elastic) waves, allows to observe directly the lower-mantle structures. But their interpretation requires knowledge of the elastic properties of the constitutive minerals. Bridgmanite accounts for more than 3/4th of the volume of the lower mantle, making it the most abundant mineral in the Earth. It is also of crucial interest when investigating lower-mantle properties. Here, the team quantifies experimentally the elastic properties of bridgmanite at the extreme conditions of the deep Earth. Coupling high pressure devices and state-of-the-art analytical techniques, they provide data allowing the interpretation of lower-mantle structures; notably that of large enigmatic provinces showing low seismic shear velocities. The project has strong implications in Seismology and broad impacts in Geodynamics. It also provides support and training in Mineral Physics for several graduate and undergraduate students, as well as educational outreach toward local elementary and middle schools. <br/><br/>In this study, the team synthesize large single crystals of (Al,Fe)-bearing bridgmanite in the laboratory. Crystal properties are investigated at extreme conditions of pressure and temperature in the diamond-anvil cell. This apparatus generates high pressures at the tip of two opposing diamonds. The high temperatures are obtained by external heating or using focused laser beams. Crystal elastic properties are measured in situ using a combination of laboratory Brillouin and impulsive stimulated light scattering, as well as X-ray diffraction at national synchrotron facilities. This is achievable because the team is developing new technology in time-resolved impulsive laser spectroscopy. These new techniques will be shared with the community for future studies of material properties at extreme conditions. The researchers use the obtained data to constrain bridgmanite full elastic moduli as a function of pressure, temperature and of its contents in iron and aluminum. Extrapolation of the results to conditions relevant to the lower mantle, as well as modeling, allows interpreting seismological observations. The project outcomes further the understanding of seismic velocities, temperature profiles and chemical compositions in the deep Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will serve as a forum for computational scientists, mathematicians, scientists and engineers to share ideas and techniques on and further the state of the art of advanced high order methods used to solve a broad range of scientific and engineering problems. American competitiveness depends heavily on technological advances.Yet American research on high order methods has been at a disadvantage compared to that in European or other nations due to the lack of conferences devoted to the subject. This conference will have broad impacts by providing a forum for researchers on high order numerical methods for the solution of scientific and engineering problems of strategic importance. It also recognizes the need for younger researchers, women and minorities  to have a forum in the US. More details about the conference can be found at https://www.nahomcon19.sdsu.edu/.<br/><br/>High order approximations to PDEs, be they finite difference, finite element or spectral, have needed advantages over lower order methods. Of course, they have lower errors for a given number of degrees of freedom. But also they are usually designed to have lower dissipation and dispersion errors. Their high resolution makes them more suitable for intrinsic multiscale problems such as turbulence computations, chemically reacting flows and  nuclear fusion reaction. The NSF currently supports numerous research projects on high order methods, but no nationwide conferences are in place that are focused on their study. The proposed conference topics are based on the general thrusts of these projects and are the forefront of high order method development. They include provably stable schemes, fast solvers for high order methods, methods for complex geometries, efficient and parallel implementations. Applications are considered in a range of fields including geoscience, fluid mechanics, combustion, solid mechanics, electromagnetics, biomedical, and image processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is an outstanding opportunity to reduce this cost by replacing current incandescent and fluorescent lighting with white light emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the color quality and efficiency must be improved further. These LED-based light bulbs produce white light by using a luminescent powder called a phosphor, coating on top of a near-ultraviolet (UV) or blue-emitting LED chip. The phosphor is a key component in these devices because it is critical for the overall efficiency and color of these bulbs; unfortunately, there are only a few viable phosphors available for this application today. Therefore, it is prudent to discover new phosphor systems to fully realize the conversion to new efficient lighting. The researchers are addressing this challenge by developing computational and data-driven methods to predict the properties of phosphors. This approach allows the directed discovery of new phosphors with enhanced optical response. This grant also supports extensive scientific education including sponsoring numerous research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. These students, mostly from underrepresented groups, are learning how to synthesize and characterize phosphors as well as the importance of this energy-efficient technology. The graduate students supported by this work are trained to pursue opportunities in the optoelectronics industry and also across the technology sector where materials science play a crucial role. Finally, the computational products of this research are disseminated through open-source platforms, so all researchers benefit from the scientific developments.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Replacing a traditional light bulb with an energy-efficient, phosphor converted-light emitting diode is one of the easiest ways to decrease electricity consumption. This goal requires the discovery of new phosphor systems, which convert the nearly monochromatic LED light into a broad spectrum white light, to fully make use of this technology. The phosphors investigated in this project are based on wide band gap materials (hosts) that contain a small amount of activator (rare-earth element). Depending on the host:activator combination, colors across the visible spectrum are obtained. The central hypothesis driving this research is that the quantum efficiency and thermal quenching resistance of a phosphor are related to the local coordination environment of the activator ion. This research employs advanced first-principles calculations, local structure analysis using X-ray and neutron scattering, and data science to establish a quantitative understanding of this relationship. Modeling these properties using computational tools and confirming the predictions through materials synthesis and characterization produces a feedback loop where our research results are improved with each discovery. The outcome is a series of design rules that will lead to the discovery of new phosphors with superior optical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet over the eons, tremendous insect pressure on plants has led to the evolution of a remarkable diversity of tactics to defend against being consumed. Plants defend with toxins, spines, and sticky sap. Despite demonstrations of how plant traits can reduce herbivory, in most wild plant systems scientists lack an understanding of the mechanisms of plant defensive responses. Do plants make specific toxins targeted at root feeders versus leaf feeders, all the while not poisoning beneficial visitors such as pollinators?  Deciphering the mechanisms of plant defense not only advances scientific knowledge of ecology and evolution but may have important societal benefits. Because wild plants have been engaged in a long-term evolutionary battle with insect pests, studying the mechanisms of defense may enhance crop pest management. This project focuses on milkweeds, which are the only host for the declining monarch butterfly.  Basic knowledge of the interaction between monarchs and milkweed will be gained, which could help sustain the monarch's threatened migration.  This project blends the latest advances in genomic manipulation, toxicology and chemistry in a way that will train scientists to meld natural history and important ecological problems.  The investigators will expand their communication to the public through schools, presentations, and a blog.<br/><br/>Little is known about how plant defenses are aimed at different attackers, whether there are trade-offs associated with multiple arms races, and whether tissue-specific phenotypic plasticity is a means to manage interactions with several pests. This work uses milkweeds as a model natural system with well-characterized defense chemistry to test the specificity and interdependence of interactions with diverse insect attackers that include leaf-feeding monarch butterflies, root-feeding beetles, and seed-feeding bugs. From the plant's perspective, trade-offs will be evaluated between multiple defenses and their non-target impacts on pollinating bumblebees as costs associated with constitutive or induced defenses. From the herbivores' perspective, assays of plant toxin expression will be coupled to impacts on insect target site enzymatic function, behavior, and whole-organism performance. Beyond guild-specific plant defense and trade-off hypotheses, classic explanations for diversity in plant defense will also be tested: the non-exclusive hypotheses that (i) naturally occurring toxin mixtures are differentially expressed in plant parts and (ii) mixtures are more effective than equal doses of single compounds. This view on specialization and interaction addresses the dynamic match in offense-defense traits that may generate diversity within plants and insects through distinct arms races occurring from roots to fruits. Feeding trials will be used to address how single cardenolides and natural mixtures impact physiological function, insect behavior, sequestration, and fitness. By extracting the Na/K-ATPase (the target of cardenolides) from the different insects, the specific action of toxins will also be assessed in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A better understanding of turbulence in the lower atmosphere is the prerequisite for better quantification and modeling of these scalar fluxes. Over the past few decades, there has been active research on the topology and transporting capacity of coherent structures in canonical turbulent boundary layers and convective systems. However, problems of practical relevance in micrometeorology have not profited from these studies. This project aims to fill the research gap by investigating the role of coherent structures in scalar transport in atmospheric boundary layer flows over heterogeneous landscapes. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the interactions between land surface heterogeneity and coherent structures at the point- and landscape- scales, and their implications for the breakdown of Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) in describing scalar fluxes. At the point-scale, the breakdown of MOST arises from advective terms communicating the signatures of land surface heterogeneity and vertical transport terms bearing the signatures of coherent structures. At the landscape-scale where a spatial averaging is conducted, dispersive fluxes arise from the interactions between land surface heterogeneity and coherent structures. This work combines field experiments and large-eddy simulations (LES) under a unifying framework via flux budget equations and their spatially-averaged version. <br/><br/>The field experiment will be conducted over a relatively flat but heterogeneous terrain in Idaho Falls, Idaho, with a 62-m tower and several short towers to be equipped with eddy covariance systems, a sodar, a wind profiler with RASS, 35 mesonet stations, and other instruments. The field work will provide a unique characterization of coherent structures and scalar turbulence in three dimensions and at high resolutions. It will allow quantification of horizontal and vertical terms in the scalar flux budget simultaneously. A series of LES runs will be used to extend the insights afforded by the field experiment from point to landscape scales. A novel approach based on quadrant analysis in time and space will be employed to model dispersive fluxes. The new datasets generated by the field experiment will provide opportunities for exploring other topics related to atmospheric boundary layer and land surface processes. Beyond the tutoring of two graduate students and two undergraduate students, the project will involve several educational and outreach components. It will generate mini-projects for students in several graduate and undergraduate courses taught by the PIs on boundary layer meteorology, applied meteorology, and fluid dynamics.

The design of catalysts that mimic the enzymes used by nature is a promising way to transform readily available starting materials such as plant cellulose. In this project, Professor Susanne Striegler of the University of Arkansas is developing fundamental understanding of enzyme-like catalysts and exploiting the synergy between their structure and function. This basic research is beneficial to our society as new avenues toward fine chemicals from bio-renewable resources grow in importance. Dr. Striegler is actively engaged in outreach activities to encourage middle and high school students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines and in combination with German language skill development. Encouraging students to strengthen their German language skills and STEM education prepares them to engage others at an international level and to study and work abroad.<br/><br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis and Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Programs of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Striegler of the University of Arkansas is developing biomimetic macromolecular, nanogel catalysts and elaborating the synergy between catalysis-supporting matrix effects and the catalytic function of transition metal complexes. The resulting catalysts may find applications ranging from new antimicrobial agents to biofuel production from non-activated oligosaccharides. Structure-activity relationship studies are being used to elaborate transition state-stabilizing interactions between non-activated saccharides and binuclear copper(II) complexes. The studies utilize kinetic analyses in combination with a computational approach to reveal binding sites of the saccharides, and energies and geometries of sugar-metal complex assemblies. The fundamental and basic studies are projected to maximize the catalytic potency of nanogels and open new research frontiers in biomimetic catalysis.

The most famous machine is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN on the Franco-Swiss border in Europe with a circumference of 16.6 miles. Reducing the size of these machines is a major goal in accelerator physics. A promising avenue utilizes intense laser beams as a compact proton source. The laser-driven proton beams to be generated in this project are expected to achieve relativistic speeds with favorable properties to reduce the size and cost of future accelerator facilities. For this purpose, a new Stanford jet target technology will be combined with a high-power laser at the Tel-Aviv Intense Lasers and Ultrafast Science facility in Israel, which has one of the fastest repetition rates in the world, firing 10 times per second. At these high rates the group will use machine learning algorithms for proton beam optimization to enable applications with high pay-off for society.<br/><br/>The investigators will perform high-repetition rate laser experiments that allow the application of machine learning algorithms to manipulate the laser pulse shape and contrast to optimize the proton beam properties. The goal is to achieve beams suitable for injection into a radio-frequency powered accelerator that has the capability to reach beam energies of 230 MeV + on a meter scale. This research will have far-reaching impact beyond the fields of laser-plasma and accelerator physics. The demonstration of the control of streaming instabilities and delivering protons beams of energy >20 MeV, >1 nC charge, <0.03 mm mrad emittance and repetition rates of 10 Hz as proposed here are well suited for subsequent acceleration to high proton energies for applications in research, medicine, and manufacturing. Stanford, with expertise in lasers, high-repetition rate experiments and accelerators, is in a unique position to deliver the components needed for compact high-efficiency hybrid accelerators.

Participating in this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program, selected students will have the opportunity to sharpen their research skills in an unfamiliar environment while developing the capacity to work effectively across cultures. Significant literature has demonstrated the important role that international education experiences play in strengthening the professional skill set of the workforce, especially STEM practitioners. Building opportunities for STEM students (especially those of underrepresented backgrounds) to engage in a unique research experience, without disrupting their curriculum calendars, allows the IRES participant to build cross-cultural communication skills, build a global network, be exposed to new perspectives and techniques and a refreshed knowledge base. As global scientific research collaboration increases, the American Chemical Society IRES program will help prepare students for a global research career which boosts competitiveness among the U.S. chemical workforce, instills an interest in expanding his/her perspective and apply local solutions to global challenges. ACS will select seven (7) qualified, diverse U.S. undergraduates to spend time in Germany (in partnership with the German Academic Exchange Service-DAAD) and three (3) at the National University of Singapore (NUS).  While fostering intellectual growth and maturity, the IRES experience is intended to catalyze students' desire to continue their graduate studies; deliver a substantial research experience; produce excellent scientific publications; instill a respect for other cultures and science professionalism; and provide an appreciation for the global scientific enterprise. <br/>On a reciprocal basis, ACS will work to place students from Germany and Singapore, at no cost to the hosting university or funding agency, in existing IRES/IREU programs in the United States. This model also brings a global perspective and network to domestic programs and allows those participants to learn from their colleagues from other parts of the globe. <br/><br/>This IRES program will prepare selected U.S. undergraduate students for advanced training in chemistry and materials sciences labs at advanced institutes in Germany and Singapore. Building upon a previous IRES program (2007-2016), this program prepares students to engage in chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science research in cross-cultural context. Students selected for the ACS IRES program will receive training in professional topics such as manuscript publishing, ethics in research, cross-cultural communication, science communication, collaboration and more. The research experience, coupled with professional skills training in an international context will increase the global competitiveness of future chemistry practitioners. <br/>During the research experience, seven students participating in the IRES program in Germany will be placed in leading research labs through the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). Three students will be placed in labs in the National University of Singapore. Students will work with graduate students to contribute to research projects, many resulting in publication or attribution in a leading journal. Throughout the research experience, IRES students have regular check-in sessions with ACS staff, including a PI visit. Students are expected to complete a research report on their experience in the style of a Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) manuscript (with feedback provided by editors) and present their research findings (via oral presentation and abstract) and experience at the spring ACS National Meeting. <br/>Selected IRES students come from a diverse background and significant effort will be placed into recruiting participants from underrepresented communities. To build a global network among U.S. IREU/IRES programs, ACS will work with our partners from Germany and Singapore to place (at no cost to the NSF) students from these countries in existing domestic IRES/IREU programs. <br/>Student researchers will explore a variety of technical topics touching on chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science.

Understanding the relation between neuronal activity in the brain and the functionality it enables is crucial to the characterization, early diagnosis, and effective treatment of mental illness. Advances in brain imaging technologies allow researchers to collect large volumes of brain activity data while subjects are resting or while working on a task. Multiple such brain imaging datasets that are publicly available present a tremendous opportunity to study the relationship between brain activity and brain functionality. However, a major factor limiting progress is the lack of suitable computational data mining tools that can sift through large volumes of data with challenging properties to discover insights about brain functionality.  One major challenge in developing the necessary tools is due to the properties of the brain activity data that are different from traditionally studied data for which majority of the computational tools are originally developed.  Another challenge is due to the manner in which desired insights are represented in the brain activity data. This project will result in novel computational tools and techniques that will address these two general challenges. This work is expected to accelerate progress towards effective treatment procedures for mental illness.<br/><br/>The overall goals of this project will be accomplished by defining original neuroimaging data analytic problems without shoe-horning them into existing frameworks, tackling the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of neuroimaging data, and leveraging domain knowledge in neuroscience. The driving neuroscience questions include: 1) What are the representations of the functional activity that adheres to the underlying structure of the brain connections? 2) What are the brain activation maps that can be used to represent a variety of brain functions and to study relationships among them? 3) What is the utility of transient brain states in uniquely identifying subjects, in comparison to a static representation? The corresponding computational research involves developing techniques for: 1) Determining the brain parcellation such that the resultant parcels reflect the underlying topographic connectivity; 2) Simultaneously learning the dictionary as well as classification models for multiple task-fMRI datasets; 3) Discovering and using transient brain states and their transitions to uniquely identify subjects based on their fMRI data. The resultant tools and techniques will enable the investigation of hypotheses relevant to personalized neuroscience -- understanding the neurological processes that are shared and unique to individual subjects. This will help achieve the clinically relevant goals of personalized neuroscience and eventually alleviate the huge societal burden of mental illness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been filled over and replaced with neighborhoods.  Such geomorphic changes increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides.  Similarly, sea level rise and climate-modulated variations in storm characteristics such as intensity, size and track path also alter flood risk.  The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which these geomorphic and climatic changes alter flood risk.  This goal will be met using a combination of computational modeling, historical climate and storm surge data analysis, and theory-based synthesis.  The study will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate and several graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented groups.  It will improve the well-being of communities within urbanized harbors and estuaries by highlighting coastal development practices that can worsen coastal flooding.  The project plan increases scientific literacy and engagement, and connects the research to applications through interactions with local stakeholders and governments, as well as the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers.<br/><br/>The project will improve the understanding and separation of climatic and geomorphic factors in coastal flooding through several elements of novel research and technical innovation.  The investigators will use a unique tide-gauge data set that extends back to the 19th century together with contemporary, retrospective, and idealized hydrodynamic models to elucidate system sensitivities.  Well-known, simplified insights into tidal dynamics will be tested for storm surge, then used to help interpret how altered local topography, bathymetry and wetland area have changed frictional damping and long-wave mechanics.  A combined analysis of climate, storm characteristics, and morphologic change will identify the modes and pathways through which climate variability and bathymetric change modulate storms surges.  Advanced non-stationary univariate and multivariate statistical models will be developed and employed to incorporate these changes and assess how statistical properties relevant for coastal design and risk assessments respond.  A flood model inter-comparison workshop will help quantify relevant modeling sensitivities, which will help to improve estuary and floodplain predictions for the academic and operational forecasting community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is targeted towards guiding the processing and design of these alloys for their rapidly expanding use in biomedical devices, aerospace and automotive components, and other applications. Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) will be examined because it is the most widely used and modeled shape memory alloy, and results from this work applied to improving its performance in practice will have the broadest impact. This research will use newly developed experimental approaches - including the ability to measure microscale deformations by tracking nanoparticle assemblies in a scanning electron microscope - to map and understand how these alloys recover large deformations, and what deformation remains permanent. Machine learning approaches will be applied to relate deformations to atomic structure, enabling an improved understanding of the effects of processing and furthering the ability to both model and design shape memory alloy components. In addition to this new information, the techniques developed in this research will be valuable contributions to the experimental mechanics infrastructure that can be used in investigations of a wide host of materials. Several outreach activities are planned, including science days and competitions to introduce students from elementary school to college to experimental mechanics and materials.  <br/> <br/>This research will experimentally characterize the interactions between stress-induced martensitic phase transformation and dislocation slip in polycrystalline shape memory alloys, specifically the impact of microstructure on the nature of these interactions and the superelastic behavior that results. Full-field, high resolution deformation mapping will be combined with high-dimensional clustering and computer vision approaches to segment and identify transformation and slip with respect to microstructure, shedding light on stochastic and deterministic contributions. This research will experimentally address a core difficulty in predicting the behavior of polycrystalline shape memory alloys, which is the existence of strain incompatibilities between the grains. Current constitutive models are largely evaluated by the comparison to experimental stress-strain curves. However, this comparison is not ideal in that it is between two different length scales: macroscopic curves are being compared to micromechanics based models. The results from this research will offer experimental insights into the intragranular interactions that are critical to the behavior of shape memory alloys, experimentally validate the underpinnings of the constitutive models, and quantitatively address hypotheses that are under active debate; such as the hypothesis that transformation and plasticity can occur synergistically, with plasticity providing a bridging mechanism across grains that are poorly oriented for transformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to addressing a fundamental scientific question that has remained open for decades, the knowledge sought by this research is essential for the advancement of a broad range of technologies and medical prognoses. For instance, the results from this project will provide direct insight into: the failure of tires, the design of stronger adhesives, the rupture of aneurisms, the design of cartilage, modeling of wound healing, etc. Additionally, this project will train two graduate students for careers in academia or industry and will integrate research results in the undergraduate and graduate curricula at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Texas at Austin.

The experimental component entails the development of new experiments that will leverage the use of optical microscopy and high-speed imaging in order to capture and measure the evolution of the various underlying processes at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of 1 micron and 200 microseconds. On the other hand, the theoretical component involves a novel mathematical formulation, and associated numerical implementation, that views fracture and healing in a unified manner as a phase transition and that allows, by design, for the accounting of the various underlying mechanisms (storage of energy by elastic deformation and dissipation of energy by viscous deformation and the creation of new surfaces) in a clear, natural, and theoretically consistent manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Burke of the University of California, Irvine is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to improve the accuracy and applicability of density functional calculations of electronic structure. Density functional theory (DFT) is a popular approach to computationally studying molecules and materials, allowing the design of new pharmaceuticals and materials using computers. The method has been used in more than 30,000 scientific papers each year and has resulted some impressive successes in predicting useful molecules.  For example, it has been used to find a better catalyst for making ammonia, an important starting material in chemical processes producing plastics, textiles, fertilizers, dyes and other chemicals.  DFT was also used to find the world's hottest superconductor, hydrogen sulfide under pressure. DFT is also used in many machine-learning applications in the physical sciences. However, even the best approximate density functionals, the basic component of DFT, have limited accuracy and ranges of applicability. Dr. Burke and his group are developing DFT methods that use machine learning to create new approximations in order to improve the computational results. He is also studying the origins of the approximations that underly DFT.  The resulting improvements in DFT may have significant technological and economic impacts.  Dr. Burke broadens understanding of DFT by hosting schools around the world and by training both undergraduate and graduate students in this important cross-disciplinary area of research.<br/><br/>Dr. Burke plans to improve DFT calculations in three distinct ways: One approach that is very novel (machine-learning), one very pragmatic and simple (density-corrected DFT), and one very old and deep (semiclassical approximations to functionals).  Dr. Burke has pioneered the creation of new functionals with machine learning (ML). These functionals depend on the density everywhere in space, i.e., are radically different for the local and semilocal approximations that form the heart of most modern DFT exchange-correlation functionals.  Dr. Burke is investigating approaches to broadening the applicability of ML density functionals. Regarding density-corrected DFT, he is evaluating functionals on Hartree-Fock densities. He uses a new method for the so-called semiclassical approximations which may lead to much more accurate kinetic energy and exchange energy functionals for realistic systems than any in use today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon, known as shear thickening, can be exploited for important applications, including energy dissipation, shock absorption and impact resistance.  However, shear thickening can also produce undesirable effects in material transport and processing. While substantial progress has been made in understanding shear thickening in suspensions of spherical and other compact particles, much less is known about shear thickening in suspensions of rod-like particles. These systems can show dramatic shear thickening at particle concentrations much lower than the concentration required for shear thickening in suspensions of spherical particles.  This suggests the possibility that suspensions with relatively low concentrations of very long rods can take advantage of shear thickening behavior in applications, or present challenges in material transport when shear thickening is not helpful. The dynamics of the orientations of the flowing rods is a critical determinant of the properties of suspensions of rods. This work seeks to characterize and understand the orientation dynamics in the shear thickening regime to enable prediction and control of the viscosity of rapidly flowing suspensions. The research team will also participate with the Science/Policy interface, a pilot project to involve a materials science graduate student in an interdisciplinary group project in science policy, and with outreach activities aimed at economically disadvantaged high school students through hands-on soft materials modules for use in the Georgetown University College Immersion Program.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to characterize shear thickening in suspensions of colloidal silica rods, which can be synthesized with a range of aspect ratios, and to utilize novel techniques to determine the dynamics of rod orientations and<br/>directly measure stress fluctuations during shear thickening. Using a customized high resolution microscope coupled with commercial rheometers, the investigators will be able to directly measure the spatially and temporally resolved orientation dynamics of the particles. In parallel, they will use a new technique they have developed to measure boundary stresses locally. Combining these two techniques will enable the team to determine the interplay between orientation fluctuations and stress fluctuations, and therefore identify the dynamical characteristics that determine shear thickening. The researchers will then extend this approach to silica rods with controlled nanoscale roughness. Orientation plays a critical role in the behavior of anisotropic molecules and particles, and the ability to control orientation through flow, external fields, or boundary effects is central to a wide range of commercial applications. The proposed research will develop and test novel tools and methods for characterizing the role of orientation in rod suspensions, and provide the characterization necessary to identify opportunities to manipulate particle orientation to control shear thickening. More generally, the proposed research will support the development and dissemination of a powerful techniques for measuring and analyzing orientation and stress dynamics of flowing suspensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These large houses, and the complex multifamily households that resided in them, have been the economic engines of the society and the scale at which resources were managed and maintained over the last five millennia. Investigations of plankhouses will therefore provide foundational data for understanding how small-scale societies can effectively organize economics, people and resources in ways that promote sustainability and resilience at the local level. The study of Northwest Coast lifeways, with its emphasis on local management of resources and decentralized decision making, can reveal potentially new strategies and options for reshaping current social practices towards greater sustainability. Archaeology is particularly suited to address these goals because it considers a range of societies with multiple different organizational principles. The project will provide cutting-edge training for graduate and undergraduate students in these increasingly important geophysical techniques. Moreover, in the face of rising sea levels, the methodological advances that will result offer a mechanism to expediently collect critical archaeological data from the globally-threatened coastal archaeological record.<br/><br/>Dr. Grier and his team will employ geophysical prospection methods, a set of techniques used to visualize the subsurface of archaeological sites without excavation. Traditional archaeological excavation is both costly and time consuming, which has resulted in a very limited sample of well-documented houses and villages for the region. Geophysical methods can provide a low-impact alternative, but they have been applied only in a limited way on the Northwest Coast. The researchers will develop a rigorous methodology for connecting the signals generated by geophysical techniques, such as ground penetrating radar and magnetometry, to specific buried archaeological features. They will generate a predictive model and evaluate predictions using limited ""ground-trothing"" excavation. Archaeological sites are a non-renewable resource, and geophysical methods, if systematically applied, can provide a means to acquire substantial data with minimal impacts, an approach consistent with the interests of First Nations/Native American Tribes, and useful for Cultural Resource Management practitioners and Public/Federal land managers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this CAREER project is to examine the effects of temperature and carbon dioxide exposure on the structure and function of the auditory (hearing) systems of closely-related sound-producing fishes of the croaker/drum family Sciaenidae.  These fishes are model organisms for the study of fish hearing and communication, most support valuable recreational fisheries in habitats ranging from fresh through salt water, and nearly all produce sounds to aid in reproduction and/or to raise alarm when disturbed or threatened. While auditory sense is of great importance to these sound producing fishes, little is known about the effects of changing environmental conditions on fish hearing and communication.  This project's interdisciplinary approach will make significant impacts in this rapidly emerging field that will be of broad interest to both the ocean science and recreational fishing stakeholder communities. The award supports recruitment and professional development of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. Student training includes mastery of quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and communication skills regarding environmental impacts on aquatic ecosystems and sustainable stewardship of future ecosystems. <br/><br/>This CAREER Award will expand the interdisciplinary neurosensory laboratory developed at Hampton University under the PI's earlier Research Initiation Award to examine how changing environmental conditions over the next century may affect the form and function of auditory systems of phylogenetically-related soniferous fishes that rely on auditory communication during aggregate spawning. This project will apply electrophysiological techniques and morphological analyses to assay the effects of increased temperature and CO2 concentrations representative of projected changes over the next century on auditory morphology and neurosensory function in representative freshwater, estuarine, and fully marine sciaenid fishes. Using related fishes from a common phylogeny but differing habitats and life histories, this project will examine the effects of chronic aqueous CO2 exposure (i.e. acidification) and increased temperature on the: (1) morphological development of sensory structures via digital microscopy and computerized tomography (CT), (2) neurosensory performance of auditory systems via Auditory Brainstem Response, and (3) manipulation of the GABA neurotransmitter to alter sensory deficits during CO2 exposure.

Despite the availability of various models in the quantum theory of gravity, fundamental questions remain on how to formulate dynamics in terms of quantum Einstein equations, and if different paths to construct such a theory result in qualitatively different physical predictions. Without insights on answers to these questions, the reliability of various models and their predictions remains an open issue. This NSF funded award aims to address various such questions in construction of models using techniques of loop quantum gravity. A primary objective will be to explore the physical consequences of choosing different procedures to construct models, especially in the cosmological setting. Research in this project will have direct implications for the understanding of a reliable procedure to quantize gravity and the way it can potentially impact physical predictions. The project aims to significantly enhance collaboration on fundamental issues in quantum gravity between researchers at Louisiana State University and at Friedrich-Alexander University at Erlangen-Nuremberg. Progress in this area of research will have broad benefit for canonical quantum gravity, classical gravity and cosmology communities.  Graduate students trained in this project will have opportunities for international collaboration.<br/><br/>Two fundamental problems in the construction of a canonical theory of quantum gravity are: (i) how to formulate quantum Einstein equations, and (ii) how does the procedure of gauge fixing in the theory commute with its quantization. Using non-trivial cosmological models,  this project aims to explore answers to the above questions. The primary goal will be to understand the physical implications of the choices made in the construction of models using techniques of loop quantum gravity, and whether they affect any qualitative predictions such as resolution of singularities and for cosmological perturbations. To overcome the problems associated with dynamics in quantum gravity, a relational formalism based on Dirac observables will be used and applied to cosmological perturbation theory both at the classical and quantum levels. The relationship between different models constructed via different routes will be explored to test their reliability and resulting predictions. This research is expected to yield significant insights on understanding the physical implications of loop quantum gravity, especially in the cosmological sector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a new technique of micropipette thermography, which, if successful, will lead to new insights into mechanisms of cancer progression, early cancer detection, and early cancer diagnosis.  This research proposes that specific cell types possess characteristic responses to heat that can be used to identify the cell type. Characterization of this property may introduce a new class of cellular thermal markers for normal or diseased cells. Significant broader impacts included the training and mentorship of graduate, undergraduate and high school students in thermal sciences. This will occur through hands-on learning experiences in the nano and bioengineering program that will combine approaches from different fields of study to reveal information about a life process.<br/><br/>The current project objectives are: (1) to determine the thermal characterization profiles of a cell line panel of serous epithelial ovarian cancer progression. A 3D model of epithelial ovarian cancer will be prepared as a test bed. Microsensors and the accompanying technical method for both the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity from previous published work will be used on clinically relevant serous epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines; (2) to correlate the thermal characterization profile with the proliferation characterization profile as a Transition Prediction Model in epithelial ovarian cancer. Subsequent analysis of the thermal-probed cells will use fluorescence analysis to determine resazurin-detected proliferation. A linear regression analysis will be performed to determine whether the profiles for thermal characterization along with proliferation characterization are correlated with cancer transition. It is noted that novel thermal properties could supersede the current paradigm which emphasizes the reliance on extensive genomic and proteomic analyses. Moreover, the added value of this project is the identification of (and continued inquiry to understand) cellular inherent thermal properties. The technology and method, if successful, will allow for a non-invasive tool, faster diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer with expedited next step bio-specimen determinations for early validation of the method and technology. Indeed, this empirical study of thermodynamics cell properties will advance recently proposed theories of heat transfer roles in metabolic reprogramming, bioenergetics, and oxidation-reduction metabolism status in cancer cell survival.  This kind of novel discovery will open doors for new therapies. Furthermore, future real-time diagnosis at the location of the cells in question, when combined with laparoscopy, may result in early detection and diagnosis. This technology ostensibly will extend to other circulating blood tumors and disease models, providing for future advancements in cancer detection and therapy solutions.

Besides the familiar pattern where new mutations lead to new traits, recent work indicates that social interactions may also expose existing genetic variation to selection much more broadly, facilitating divergence and speciation. The implications for whether and how natural animal populations adapt to new environments are of broad relevance and utility to society, and this work helps to elucidate the conditions under which adaptation to novel environments may be faster than currently anticipated. The project integrates research, mentorship, teaching, and community outreach to study plant-feeding insects that communicate with plant-borne vibrational signals, and the ways in which behavioral encounters between closely related species of these insects induce variation in their mating signals and mate preferences. The project involves a trans-Atlantic collaboration between senior and junior researchers; resource-development for researchers (making new software tools broadly and freely available); a pilot program for alternative-career training track in software development for PhD graduates; community outreach for families; and leveraging the host university's position as an urban-access university to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in science.<br/><br/>Biologists can best conceptualize speciation when population divergence in ecological and reproductive traits is accomplished by changes in a single locus. But speciation often involves divergence in complex suites of polygenic traits, and it is not clear how linkage disequilibrium is established and sustained in these cases. This project will test the hypothesis that social plasticity can cause polygenic traits such as mating signals and mate preferences to co-diverge as if they were controlled by a single locus. This could prevent gene flow between diverging populations early in speciation and help build up linkage disequilibrium. This would extend the efficiency of the simplest known speciation scenario to cases involving divergence in polygenic traits. The project integrates both empirical and theoretical approaches. The empirical component of the proposal will use the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers. This group of plant-feeding insects offer a case study of signal-preference co-divergence that provides unusual resolution in the analysis of the causes and consequences of variation in signals and preferences. Experiments will contrast phenotypic variation in mating signals and mate preferences due to developing in conditions mimicking first contact between closely related species with that due to genetic hybridization. Support for the hypothesis requires that signals and preferences co-diverge due to social plasticity upon first contact between nascent species. The project will also assess geographic variation in the social plastic response to test the competing hypothesis of reinforcement on signal-preference plasticity. Theoretical work will generalize the empirical tests of the hypotheses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When more aerosols are present clouds tend to have a larger number of smaller droplets, making them brighter and more effective in reflecting sunlight back to space. Thus increases in aerosol amount due to industrial activity can increase the brightness of clouds, resulting in a cooling effect on climate.  The extent to which the global temperature increase from greenhouse warming has been offset by human-induced radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud-interactions (RFaci) is an important and unsolved problem in climate science.<br/><br/>One obstacle to progress on RFaci is the difficulty of performing computer simulations which explicitly represent cloud properties yet cover the whole earth, so that global climatic effects can be assessed. Cloud motions are turbulent and require models with grid points spaced a fraction of a kilometer apart, while global model grid spacing is typically tens to hundreds of kilometers.  To bridge this scale gap the PIs have developed an ultraparameterized (UP) model, meaning a global model with coarse grid spacing in which each grid box contains a fine-scale cloud resolving model with a domain size much smaller than the grid box.  The model is challenging both scientifically and computationally, and the project includes a concerted effort to improve computational efficiency to make simulations practical.<br/><br/>The research addresses several specific questions regarding RFaci.  One question is why climate models tend to overestimate RFaci compared to estimates from satellites, in some cases by a factor of two. Comparisons between the UP model and satellite observations will be facilitated by a nudging methodology, in which external forcing is used to constrain the simulated weather patterns to match the days when the satellite observations were taken.  The nudging minimizes differences between simulated and satellite-estimated RFaci due to incorrect simulation of large-scale circulation features, allowing attribution of differences to aerosol-cloud interactions.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the societal implications of high versus low RFaci: if the cooling effect of industrially-driven RFaci is large, the strength of greenhouse warming must be at the high end of current estimates in order to explain the warming seen over the past century.  Likewise, if industrial RFaci cooling was small over the last century, the sensitivity of global temperature to greenhouse gas increase is likely to be on the lower end of its estimated range. RFaci is thus among the largest uncertainties in determining climate sensitivity and the severity of climate change impacts. In addition, software developed under the project is made available to the research community, in part through a version of the Community Earth System Model.  The project provides support and training for a postdoctoral research scholar, thereby providing workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hratchian, of the University of California Merced, is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new theoretical models to study transition metal compounds.  Transition metals include commonly known metals such as iron, gold, copper, titanium, and platinum.   The transition metal compounds used in this project are useful for increasing the speed of chemical reactions (chemical catalysts). Modeling chemical catalysis and the experiments that demonstrate their properties is challenging due to the complexity of their electronic structure. Professor Hratchian's research is focused on designing and applying new predictive models, which can be translated into useful software to address this complexity. These models inform and guide the rational design of next-generation catalysts used in energy research and pharmaceutical production.  <br/>Strong collaborations with experimental groups enhance the impact and scope of this project. Professor Hratchian develops new educational programs at UC Merced to improve student success. The outreach and education goals address needs at both graduate and undergraduate levels. At the graduate level, Professor Hratchian is expanding a program introducing students to leaders in quantum chemistry using an informal journal club setting. At the undergraduate level, new computational and simulation modules enhancing learning are being developed and implemented in the curriculum. Professor Hratchian also engages in outreach with local school districts and works with K-8 educators to develop new visualization tools for immersive learning with students in the Merced City School District.<br/><br/>This project has three main scientific objectives to assess currently available approximate spin projection models, to develop and implement new models that address electronic structures posing challenges for current models and to explore metal oxide and metal sulfide chemistry using these new models. The project builds on recent work from the Professor Hratchian's research group developing a hierarchy of affordable and predictive models for studies involving metal oxides, metal sulfides, and other systems suffering from spin contamination. This work is of critical importance in the field as spin contamination limits the expected accuracy of affordable mean-field models. Professor Hratchian also engages in educational activities aimed at students at all levels. These educational activities include the development of new computational modules to enhance learning in undergraduate courses, the expansion of a graduate level training activity, and collaboration with a local K-8 school district to build visualization models as engaging vehicles for immersive learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is intimately connected to the global system via ocean, land, and air masses, as well as the people that inhabit and/or are connected economically to the Arctic region. This is an unprecedented time in terms of rapid changes occurring in the Arctic, and our abilities to understand, predict, and respond to those changes are of US and international strategic interest. No single country is able to support the level of research necessary to keep pace with the changing Arctic, and therefore organizations like the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) represent vital platforms for discussing scientific issues and promoting international, interdisciplinary, and in some cases large-scale projects in the region. The impacts from melting sea ice on biogeochemical cycles, thawing permafrost and resulting change to the carbon cycle, biodiversity and northward species migration and ecosystem reorganization, and associated human interactions and response all link the Arctic to the global system and represent issues so important and so large that no one country can adequately address them in isolation. Additionally, new opportunities for economic development, fisheries, resource extraction and tourism carry a relatively high risk because Arctic science remains relatively immature. To this end, this project provides national support to maintain and enhance US leadership and partnerships in IASC, as well as our planning and coordinating roles for research efforts in the international arena.<br/><br/>The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) is a non-governmental international membership organization that encourages and facilitates cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research, in all countries engaged in Arctic research, and in all areas of the Arctic region.

IASC is an international associate of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and an observer in the Arctic Council and has connections to numerous other international Arctic organizations. The US is one of eight Arctic nations in the Arctic Council, with IASC playing a role in providing scientific input to this international policy organization. IASC assists with science development by providing scientific advice as well as coordination to support international science development. Since the founding of IASC, the scientific, environmental, economic and political realities of the North have changed dramatically.

Many of these habitats have experienced widespread loss and fragmentation due to human activities. This loss threatens the services these ecosystems provide to humans as well as the extraordinary biodiversity of fishes and invertebrates that live within them. However, there is still a lot that is unknown about these habitats which makes it difficult to understand the likely impacts of habitat loss or the benefits of habitat restoration. This research focuses on habitat loss and fragmentation in coral reef ecosystems. The focus of the research is to understand how habitat loss and fragmentation affect the biodiversity of fish and crustaceans on coral reefs in the South Pacific. Because many creatures living within the coral offer important benefits to the coral such as defense from coral predators and removal of sediment, this research also seeks to better understand how changes in the biodiversity and abundance of fish and invertebrates associated with corals, affect the capacity of corals to withstand future impacts, such as sedimentation and outbreaks of coral-eating seastars. Understanding whether habitat loss alters the capacity of corals to withstand stress in an increasingly stressful world is critical to devise effective strategies to manage and protect coral reefs and the many services they provide to society. Furthermore, this research facilitates restoration efforts, enhance the scientific workforce through mentorship of a diverse group of undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, and engage the public in both French Polynesia and the United States in scientific research and knowledge. <br/><br/>Many marine systems are characterized by habitat-forming foundation species, which harbor a diversity of occupants, and whose dynamics are thought to drive resilience of entire ecosystems As a result, there is widespread concern over the ongoing loss and fragmentation of biogenic habitats such as seagrass beds, oyster reefs, kelp forests, and coral reefs. Yet, without a more complete understanding of marine landscape ecology, we struggle to predict how the degradation or restoration of habitat alters ecosystem dynamics, function, and resilience. Most research in marine landscape ecology has focused on spatial patterns of occupant abundance and biodiversity; however, the causes and consequences of these patterns are rarely explored. An important but understudied consequence of variation in occupant density is that it may alter how occupants interact with their biogenic habitat. Because occupants can benefit biogenic habitat or harm biogenic habitat, changes in occupant density can affect habitat growth and survival. Consequently, habitat-driven variation in occupant density should feed back to alter habitat dynamics and the spatial patterning of the habitat. In summary, we are limited in our understanding of why patterns in landscape ecology exist, how these patterns alter the population dynamics and spatial patterns of the occupants as well as their habitat, and the implications of habitat degradation or restoration. The central objective of this proposal is to examine the causes and consequences of the nonlinear relationship between occupant abundance and the amount of biogenic habitat.  Specifically, the investigators: (i) examine the habitat-based mechanisms that produce spatial variation in occupant density; (ii) quantify how habitat-driven occupant density feeds back to alter habitat growth and survival; and (iii) apply this knowledge to understand how bidirectional habitat-occupant interactions affect the long-term dynamics, create novel spatial patterns, and drive variation in how systems respond to and recover from disturbances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to address the challenges when mapping complicated DNN models into hardware for energy-efficient and performance-driven implementations. The proposed techniques will promote wider adoptions of deep learning into both high-performance and low-power computing systems. The project will also enhance economic opportunities and have significant societal benefits via solutions that support broader adoption of intelligent systems for big data analytics, weather modeling and forecasting, disease diagnosis and drug delivery, and medical image processing. The research advances will be incorporated into coursework taught by the investigators. Activities on engaging underrepresented, undergraduate, and K12 students will be designed in collaboration with the Northeastern University Center of STEM Education and University of Southern California's Viterbi Center for Engineering Diversity. All software code from the project will be released via GitHub and educational modules and tutorials will be make available to the research community, industry, and government.<br/> <br/>Exploring the inherent model redundancy of DNNs, this project will develop an algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework for greatly reducing DNN computation and storage requirements by leveraging ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers), a powerful optimization technique. This project first solves the challenge in the application of ADMM due to the non-convex objective function in DNN training, and thereby lack of guarantees on solution feasibility, solution quality, and low runtime. Therefore, an integrated framework of ADMM regularization and masked mapping and retraining will be developed and further improvements on solution quality, performance-driven computation/storage reduction, and hardware feasibility will be investigated. Next, the project proposes a unified weight and intermediate result pruning and quantization technique that explores all four redundancy sources of DNN models. Due to the impact on energy efficiency of hardware implementations of DNNs, nearly all DNN models, or at least the most computationally intensive convolutional layers can be then placed on a single chip. Finally, design-time parameterization and algorithm-hardware co-design solutions will be developed for efficient utilization of available hardware resources, achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and adaptation capability. Extensive experimentation and evaluation will be performed to validate and tune the proposed technique with prototype systems using FPGA devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The communication within cells that allows cellular processes to occur is mediated by interactions between proteins. Understanding the details of these interactions, including their strength and specificity, will allow researchers to predict and modify the many types of cell behavior. Results will provide deeper insights into how protein binding interactions function in different cellular contexts and help explain how a common interaction can specialize to perform many different cellular functions. Undergraduate students working on this project will have the opportunity to learn both computational and experimental biophysics skills, including how both computational and experimental data can contribute to a project to form a more complete model of protein interactions. Students will also work closely with scientists at Texas Tech University (Mike Latham) and the University of Liverpool (Elliott Stollar) and experience first-hand the importance of collaboration to the modern scientific process. To allow a larger number of students to have an experience with undergraduate research, a research-based lab course will expose students to techniques in computational biophysics and molecular dynamics simulations. In this course, students develop and carryout a research project contributing to the larger project goals. This project also includes the development of a one-credit course for science majors on women and underrepresented groups in science. This course will be geared toward all natural science majors, and will encourage students navigating a major where women are traditionally underrepresented to consider and grapple with ideas about identity in science. Topics will include the challenges that women and minorities may face regarding identifying as scientists, stereotype threat, and impostor syndrome. The course will prepare students to be leaders on the topic of underrepresented groups in science and include a service-learning project.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cellular signaling interactions often involve binding of intrinsically disordered protein regions to small domains, but the binding pathways for these interactions are often not well understood. Full understanding of how these disordered folding and binding interactions contribute to function requires knowing how the binding pathway can be tuned in different contexts by adjusting the disordered sequence, domain sequence, or solvent environment of the interaction. This project will address this question using an SH3 domain-peptide interaction (Abp1p SH3 domain binding to the ArkA peptide) as a model system and employing a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy. SH3 domains are ubiquitous across eukaryotes, but the SH3 domain family contains many variations that impact function. These variations can influence the binding pathway, which in turn will affect biophysical properties such as binding affinity and association rates. This research will investigate how different aspects of the SH3-peptide interaction contribute to the binding pathway and biophysical properties of binding, ultimately defining a set of ""rules"" that help predict the ways that this interaction can be modulated with different functional consequences. Binding is hypothesized to begin with an initial encounter between ArkA and the SH3 domain, followed by fast initial binding of ArkA segment 1, and then slower, more specific binding of segment 2. Aim 1 of the research will confirm the role of the two ArkA segments in the binding pathway and determine how each affects affinity, specificity, and kinetics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of electrostatics in binding, and how it affects initial steering to the binding site as well its importance for specifically binding the correct peptide sequence. Aim 3 will focus on the importance of proline residues in the peptide sequence. Proline can uniquely affect conformation by switching between cis and trans conformational states and adopting a rigid poly-proline II helix structure. The project will help to advance our understanding of how disordered protein regions bind SH3 domains and how diversity between different SH3 domains and partners contributes to their functional differentiation. Understanding how these biophysical properties are tuned will not only impact the field of SH3 signaling, but also the wider field of disordered peptide binding, as similar mechanisms may exist for other recognition domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials also show promise as membranes for water purification and fuel cells. However, TPEs are challenged by issues with long-term stability, which limits their service life in established applications and prevents their adoption in clean water and clean air technologies. This research program will lay critical groundwork to address this challenge by tailoring the structure of block copolymer TPEs with a class of interaction-tuned polymer additives, thereby enabling careful studies of the molecular and mesoscale attributes that control the observed mechanical properties. This knowledge will guide the development of high-performance block copolymer TPEs that maintain their mechanical integrity over long timescales. Furthermore, the principles can be extended beyond the model chemistries that are the focus of this research program, thereby facilitating the development of new TPEs based on renewable feedstocks. The collaboration between Stein and Kilbey will provide graduate and undergraduate students with training in polymer synthesis and advanced materials characterization techniques. Laboratory research is complemented by 1) an annual workshop for graduate students at UTK focused on Fundamentals of Polymer Physics; and 2) a new graduate elective that provides training in Computational Tools for Data Analysis, which introduces methods to process, analyze and organize large amounts of experimental data. Undergraduate student involvement is facilitated by the NSF-supported ASPIRE and TLSAMP programs at UTK, which provide funded research opportunities for students from under-represented groups, especially first-generation college students from the Appalachia region.<br/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This research program will examine structure and properties in blends of linear triblock copolymers and interaction-tuned random copolymer (PrC) additives. The enthalpic and entropic driving forces that control miscibility of these constituents will be tailored by changing the composition, molecular weight and architecture of the PrC additives, enabling a systematic interrogation of a large parameter space. Three related research thrusts will test the key hypothesis that PrC additives can enhance macroscopic mechanical properties by modulating the local structure within nanoscopic PS domains. The local structure, as defined in the proposal, includes attributes such as chain conformations, interfacial area per chain, and the spatial distribution of PrC additives. Outcomes of this research will provide a framework that guides the design of miscible polymer additives to enhance specific TPE properties, including tensile strength, ductility, or creep resistance. This will allow for the design of block copolymer membranes that preserve their mechanical properties over long time scales, which is critical for next-generation energy conversion devices and water purification technologies. Although this research program will be implemented with model styrenic materials, the fundamental principles elucidated through the design of PrC additives are envisioned to be directly relatable to other classes of materials that face similar challenges with long-term stability, including those derived from renewable resources. Students will be trained in polymer chemistry, polymer physics, high-throughput analysis of large data sets, and advanced materials characterization. These technical skills are critical for competitiveness in and lifelong contributions to a society dependent on materials science and engineering. Additionally, opportunities provided to and direct mentoring of students from under-represented groups will help to inspire and stimulate young learners, catalyze their success, and ignite curiosity, ultimately fostering the development of a diverse and competitive workforce. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conversion of coal and biomass into useful fuel, thermal storage by particulate material, and particle-based solar receivers, all represent promising technologies that rely heavily on heat transfer in multiphase systems. Current tools used in industry and academia rely on simplistic models for average reaction rates as well as heat transfer coefficients that are known to vary by several orders of magnitude. This project introduces a new modeling approach that will enable researchers to address the huge range of challenges associated with heat transfer through gas-particle mixtures. For a broader educational impact, a toy version of a fluidized bed will be built with beads sprayed with thermochromic liquid crystals that change color with temperature. This will be presented at local schools to illustrate fundamental concepts of fluid-particle interactions.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers from Michigan, Iowa State, and Minnesota collaborate to develop a new paradigm in multiphase heat transfer modeling. The aim is to bridge the gap between particle-scale thermal processes and device-scale predictions. A consistent modeling framework is formulated that scales from a well-accepted physics-based model to a larger scale of interest. Current approaches typically ensemble-average data obtained from the microscale physics directly, without taking into account local variations on scales resolvable by the simulation framework. The proposed effort will connect the spatially-averaged, large-scale representation to two-phase statistics obtained from particle-resolved numerical simulations. A previously overlooked ergodic consistency requirement will be enforced so that the numerical solution converges to the ensemble-averaged two-fluid equations in the limit of large filter width.

Dr. Yang's research focuses on studying the distributions of electrons in, or the electronic structures of, chemical systems.  The electrons present in atoms rearrange their positions when atoms combine (or bond) to form molecules and solids.  This positioning determines the characteristic chemical properties of these systems and is important when studying many challenging problems in science.  Specifically, Dr. Yang models the electronic structure of chemical systems using equations of motion based on a mathematical method called density functional theory.  This theory has been applied successfully in a wide array of chemical studies such as modeling the speed of chemical reactions, solar energy conversion, fuel cell design and the development of pharmaceuticals; however, there are still important areas, including studies involving charged or transitory systems, where density functional theory contains approximations which lead to significant errors.  Dr. Yang's project focuses on analyzing these errors and developing systematic corrections to the approximations in current use, thus making the density functional theory of electronic structure more accurate and robust. The advances in density functional theory from this research may find applications to a wide range of computational modeling problems in biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, nanoscience and nanotechnology.  The project contributes to the development of future generations of theoretical and computational chemistry researchers.  Dr. Yang also engage students from underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in his research project as part of Project SEED.<br/><br/>The density functional theory (DFT) of electronic structure has had a significant impact on the application of quantum mechanics to many interesting and challenging problems in chemistry. Much progress has been made in both the forms and the performance of the approximate functionals based on the so-called generalized gradient approximation (GGA), ranging from meta-GGA and hyper-GGA to functionals incorporating perturbation theory and the random phase approximation. With all these developments, the accuracy of density functional approximations has been significantly improved for many chemical and physical problems, even for the very challenging problem of long-range van der Waals attractions. However, outstanding challenges in DFT remain and these challenges prevent the broad and robust application of DFT. Commonly used approximate functionals have significant delocalization error, with deviations from the exact linearity condition for fractional charges, leading to many inaccuracies in applications. These functionals also fail to describe static or strong correlation. Necessary conditions for overcoming these errors have been expressed in terms of fractional charges and fractional spins. Dr. Yang's research group derives corrections to commonly used functionals to satisfy these constraints, thus advancing the frontiers of DFT. Research efforts focus on eliminating delocalization error with localized orbital scaling corrections and reducing static correction errors with both localized orbital scaling corrections and multireference DFT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorial structure arises in these areas because one would like to model, for example, how the genetic makeup of a population changes over time, or to develop processes that move efficiently through the space of phylogenetic trees in search of the most likely one for a group of organisms.  One of the challenges in understanding these processes is determining how changes to the combinatorial structure accumulate over time.  This project seeks to develop new methods for understanding such processes when their behavior is driven by the rapid accumulation of small changes.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in this project.<br/><br/>Set partitions, integer partitions, and integer compositions play a central role in the study of combinatorial stochastic processes.  Markov processes on set partitions and integer partitions are well studied, but the theory for integer composition-valued processes is not as well developed.

This theory provides a general framework for understanding the nature of classification of mathematical objects up to some notion of equivalence, and, due to its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many areas of mathematics. A central place in this theory is occupied by countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs), which arise via actions of countable groups as well as via locally countable graphs. These connections between equivalence relations, group actions, and graphs create an extremely fruitful interplay between descriptive set theory, ergodic theory, measured group theory, and descriptive graph combinatorics. The overarching goal of the reseach is to deepen the understanding of these connections and further the theory of CBERs having major open questions as guiding targets.<br/><br/>The projects can be grouped into four topics. The first concerns closure properties of the class of treeable CBERs, namely, whether abstract quasi-isometries and finite index extensions preserve treeability in the Borel or measurable contexts. Next is the investigation of the quasi-invariant setting aiming to develop a theory of quasi-invariant cost. The third topic is the existence of desirable subgraphs of graphings of a CBER, e.g., the existence of cost-approximating subgraphings or subtreeings, as well as that of maximal hyperfinite free factors.

An ideal surface for condensation enhancement must provide large heat transfer areas and rapid droplet removal in durable operations. Until now, this could not be achieved because of scientific challenges in both droplet removal and surface durability. First, the passive liquid repellency on air-independent rough surfaces has not been achieved due to the large pinning forces on rough surfaces. Second, the surface durability in a steam environment with continuous droplet shedding cannot be sustained. Most of existing liquid-repellent surfaces rely on the existence of air lubricant, which can be displaced in a steam environment or in contact with low surface tension fluids, leading to the failure of condensate removal. The goal of this EAGER project is to address those challenges by developing previously unachieved hydrophilic and slippery rough surfaces. The research outcomes are integrated with outreach and education, with under-represented students recruited and trained. The PI also actively approaches the industrial companies in Texas for broad impact of the research .<br/><br/>The experimental study of condensation enhancement on air-independent slippery rough surfaces leads to a conceptually different strategy from the air-dependent condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces. This hydrophilic slippery rough surface gives a large surface area for condensation and in the meantime keeps a small contact angle hysteresis for condensate removal. The research objectives include: (1) experimentally demonstrate that the slippery rough surfaces can significantly increase the condensation heat transfer coefficient compared with the state-of-the-art condensing surfaces, and (2) understand the failure mechanism of this surface in a steam environment with continuous droplet shedding. To improve surface durability, polymer chains are grafted on the rough substrate to simultaneously enhance heat transfer areas and droplet removal. This project leads to the development of durable air-independent slippery rough surfaces for exceptional condensation enhancement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such understanding will directly impact the ability to engineer the formation of nanometer scale precipitates (particles) within these Ti alloys, leading to substantially higher strengths. The proposed research effort brings together state-of-the-art characterization tools for addressing these precipitation mechanisms. While the focus of the proposed program is on titanium alloys, it should be noted that the mechanisms being investigated are applicable in general to other metallic materials, and, in principle, also to other types of materials, such as ceramics. Additionally, the program will also illustrate the advantage of using state-of-the-art tools in a correlative manner for nanoscale characterization which will be applicable to a wide range of metallic materials beyond Ti alloys. The successful implementation of the proposed research will result in new science and have a significant impact on industrial exploitation of materials and hence will make a positive contribution to the Nation's economy. The accurate mechanistic understandings developed will be used to inform computational tools, improving their accuracy, and this will have a marked impact on industry. The educational outreach will consist of multiple components, including the development of simple yet attractive modules, based on scanning electron microscopy, for high school and undergraduate students as well as the general public to the fascinating world of metals and materials in general. Such activities will have a significant influence on encouraging high school students with diverse ethnic backgrounds to enter science and engineering disciplines. These educational activities will closely couple with the educational and outreach activities of the Center for the Accelerated Maturation of Materials at Ohio State University. Due to its geographic location, the College of Engineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at University of North Texas are in a unique position to offer such education and training to the workforce of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. In addition, the university has a substantial segment of students of Hispanic origin. These students will gain substantially from the research and education activities associated with this program.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>This research program involves a focused effort aimed at formulating a detailed understanding of the factors influencing refined alpha precipitation in titanium (Ti) alloys, and its consequent impact on deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties. More specifically, this program focuses on the influence of metastable precursors, involving structural and compositional variations within the parent matrix, on solid-state precipitation of fine scale alpha in Ti alloys and its consequent influence on deformation mechanisms. The significance of this program stems from the interrelationship between the complex, often hierarchical (multiple length scales) microstructure, and properties in these (as in other) alloys. In the main, these interrelationships have been determined experimentally, and to reduce the time and costs of materials development and optimization, in the future these quantities will be the subject of prediction by computational models. The successful development of such computational models of microstructural evolution and deformation depends critically on accurate descriptions of the nucleation process, so that the models may be as physically relevant as possible. Furthermore, it is now well recognized that classical nucleation theories, based purely on statistical considerations, are in many cases inadequate descriptions for developing robust computational models. Hence, it is the role of this program to provide such accurate mechanistic descriptions of both intrinsic and extrinsic (e.g., metastable instabilities in the beta phase) factors that influence the nucleation process. Under this program these mechanisms will be derived solely from critical experiments. Additionally, the critical deformation mechanisms and resulting mechanical properties corresponding to such refined scale alpha distributions within the beta matrix of Ti alloys will be investigated under this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long course sequences in mathematics can be a barrier to timely completion of the degree. Thus, the reform of such course sequences in mathematics, to improve both time to completion and rate of completion, is of great significance both statewide and nationally. Project goals focus on improving student success by: 1) increasing Fast Track math course success; 2) increasing persistence in students' STEM major; 3) increasing the percentage of STEM students who earn an AA/AS degree and/or transfer; and 4) decreasing the amount of time to earn a degree and/or transfer to a baccalaureate STEM degree program.

These trade-offs prevent individual biological species from dominating every habitat and climatic condition. However, while these trade-offs are prevalent, the understanding of what genetic and physiological mechanisms cause them is poor. Identifying the mechanisms underlying trade-offs in plants will provide knowledge of how evolution works and guidance for the improvement of crop species. This research focuses on understanding why trade-offs occur for adaptations of the yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus) to highly divergent coastal and inland climatic conditions in California. The coastal habitats of this region are inundated by a cool ocean fog during the summer months, which allows plants to survive year-round, but also means that there are more herbivores which eat them. In contrast, inland habitats are very hot and dry in the summer. The ways in which monkeyflowers have adapted to these different climates involves strong trade-offs, for which this research will establish the underlying mechanisms. The research will involve the mentorship of graduate students, postdocs, and underrepresented minority undergraduate students. Further, this award will support an ongoing partnership between investigators and the Michigan State University College of Education to create an inquiry-based learning module, focused on the monkeyflower system, for low-income middle school classrooms in Flint, MI. A website will be developed for distribution of this education module to classrooms nationwide. <br/><br/>Whether to allocate resources to reproduction, growth, and/or defense is a fundamental dilemma faced by all plant species. This research will focus on the evolutionary divergence in allocation to rapid reproduction, long-term growth, and herbivore resistance between coastal and inland M. guttatus. Inland populations allocate resources primarily to rapid growth and reproduction to escape from seasonal drought while investing little in herbivore resistance. Coastal populations have evolved to invest more in vegetative growth and herbivore resistance as a result of higher herbivore pressure and a longer growing season. Aim 1 of the research will evaluate how two previously identified loci (DIV1 and DIV2) involved in adaptive divergence between coastal and inland populations contribute to concentrations of precursor and bioactive forms of the Gibberellin (GA) growth hormone and the defense hormone Jasmonic Acid (JA). The effects of the two loci on induced and constitutive levels of defensive phenylpropanoid glycosides (PPGs) will be evaluated. Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive variation in allocation among rapid reproduction, long-term vegetative growth, and herbivore resistance. Functional molecular studies of gibberellin biosynthesis and signaling genes will be conducted to evaluate their role in the evolution of trade-offs. Aim 3 will use hormone applications in the field to evaluate the role of those hormones in adaptive shifts in resource allocation across climatic conditions. Plants will be grown in manipulative reciprocal transplant experiments to assess the roles of GA and JA pathways on flowering time, biomass, and fitness in coastal and inland habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the mechanisms by which individual cells are set on the path to, and then maintain, their identity and function, and how they communicate with each other in order to coordinate development of the whole organism, is of keen interest to developmental biologists. The goals of this project are two-fold. First, it develops computational tools for 1) characterizing the impact of cell-cell communication on molecular function, 2) measuring biological variation in molecular function between cells collected from different tissues or individuals, and 3) predicting experimental strategies for manipulating cell identity and function. Second, it trains high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the use of these tools and data analysis techniques, and develops approaches to engage students in interdisciplinary team-based genomics research. The project will thus achieve the broader goal of training the next generation of data scientists to address important problems in biology using genomics technologies. <br/><br/>Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies enable the measurement of different dynamic aspects of gene regulation across a wide spectrum of organisms. For each segment of DNA in a genome, we can now measure a snapshot of its physical accessibility, measure its relative rate of transcription into RNA, identify the location of reversible modifications to the DNA or its anchoring proteins, and even identify other distal DNA segments that are in physical contact with it. The research goal of this project is to quantitatively characterize the mechanisms by which signals from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors are integrated to drive variation in gene and chromatin regulation, and ultimately define cell identity and its dynamics. It specifically develops tools based on deep neural networks to perform in silico perturbations to cells in order to identify the regulators of transcriptional cell state, identify regulatory pathways underlying cellular responses to stimuli, and characterize the effect of cell-cell communication on gene regulation.

As examples, graphs are used to represent people and their interactions in social networks, or proteins and their functionality in biological networks, landmarks and roads in transportation networks, etc. Understanding graph properties and deriving hidden information by performing analytics on graphs at extreme scale is critical for the progress of science across multiple domains and solving real world impactful problems. Cloud platforms have been adopted to perform extreme scale graph analytics. This has led to exponential increase in the workloads while at the same time the rate of performance improvements of cloud platforms has slowed down. To address this, cloud platforms are being augmented with accelerators. However, the expertise required to realize high performance from such accelerator enhanced cloud platforms will limit their accessibility to the broader scientific and engineering community.  To address this issue, this project will research and develop a toolkit to provide Graph Analytics as a Service to enable researchers to easily perform extreme scale graph analytics workflows on accelerator enhanced cloud platforms. This will significantly increase the productivity of the researchers as i) the researchers will avoid the steep learning curve of developing parallel implementation of graph analytics algorithms, and ii) the increased size and scale of graph analytics will allow researchers to analyze significantly large datasets at reduced latency thereby enriching the quality of the domain research. Moreover, the techniques developed in this project will also be applicable for performing streaming graph analytics at the ""edge"" for applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructure, etc. The toolkit is expected to be used in many engineering and science disciplines including power systems engineering, network biology, preventive healthcare, smart infrastructure, etc. The research conducted in this project will also constitute materials appropriate for inclusion in graduate and undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>The project will research and develop high performance graph analytics algorithms and software for key graph workflows and kernels spanning multiple scientific and engineering domains. The target platform will be accelerator enhanced cloud platforms consisting of emerging node architectures comprising of multi-core processors, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and high bandwidth memory (HBM) with cache coherent interface. An integrated optimization framework consisting of memory optimizations and partitioning and mapping techniques will be developed to exploit the heterogeneity of the target platforms. Specifically, techniques for optimal memory data layout and integrated optimizations for cloud execution will be developed to realize scalable performance in accelerator enhanced cloud platforms. The memory data layout optimization seeks to fully exploit the high bandwidth provided by HBM by ensuring data reuse for a broad class of graph analytics problems. The proposed software will ensure seamless parallel processing of the entire graph on a single heterogeneous node architecture as well as cloud platforms with multiple heterogeneous nodes. The integrated optimization framework will be developed into a scalable, deployable, robust Cyber Infrastructure (CI) toolkit to provide Graph Analytics as a Service (GAaaS). The framework will be developed using state-of-the-art heterogeneous platforms. By accelerating graph analytics workflows on cloud platforms, this project will enable researchers to perform extremely large-scale graph analytics workflows which are key components of many scientific and engineering domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transformations in question include several versions of the Hilbert transform on the integers in dimension one and on the lattice in several dimensions. These basic transformations were introduced by David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century as simpler models of their continuous counterparts. For many applications, discrete models are much simpler from the point of view of computations. One of the goals of the project is to show that the magnitudes of the discrete transformations, as measured by certain summability properties of the sequences they transform, coincide with those of their continuous counterparts. Related geometric problems concerning the long time behavior of Brownian motion and more general stochastic processes under certain natural constrains, will be studied as well.<br/><br/>The project deals with several problems and conjectures for sharp inequalities which lie at the interface of probability, harmonic analysis and spectral, potential theoretic, and geometric properties of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian. A problem of significant interest in the early part of the 20th century was the question of how the size of a periodic function controls the size of its conjugate, where the size is measured by the Lebesgue Lp-norm, where p is strictly between 1 and infinity. In 1925, M. Riesz answered this question in his celebrated paper on the Lp boundedness of the Hilbert transform and showed that this implies the same for the discrete version acting on the space of doubly infinite sequences in little lp. Shortly thereafter, E.C. Titchmarsh gave a direct proof of the boundedness of the discrete Hilbert transform and showed that the norms of these two operators are equal. The following year Titchmarsh pointed out that his argument for equality was incorrect. The question of equality had been a long-standing open problem since 1927. In a recent publication, M. Kwasnicki and the PI solved this problem by identifying the sharp lp bound for the discrete Hilbert transform which turns out to be the same as the sharp Lp bound found for the continuous version found by Pichorides in the early 70's. The first part of this project discusses closely related problems for discrete operators in one and several dimensions. The second part of the project addresses questions of sharp inequalities, known as stability (or deficit) inequalities, for exit times of Brownian motion and symmetric stable processes from subsets of finite volume in Euclidean spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The objective of this study is to better understand how neurons (the cells that perform the communication in our nervous system) acclimate to changes in environmental temperature. Proper nervous system function is dependent on many temperature-sensitive processes. Currently, it is not well understood how the nervous system of cold-blooded animals acclimates to temperature changes. Most studies on this topic have examined either how proteins or DNA changes in response to temperature change. However, this study will investigate how RNA changes in response to temperature, and will use the octopus as a model system to do so. Octopuses are able to edit a large proportion of their RNAs via a process called ""RNA editing"" to produce new proteins. However, it remains unclear how this is accomplished. Few examples of altered protein function through RNA editing have been documented in any animal, and none as a result of temperature acclimation. The findings from this study will help determine whether RNA editing is an important mechanism for acclimation in the octopus nervous system to rapid temperature fluctuations. In addition to this research, the fellow will promote greater inclusion of underrepresented groups in research at the Marine Biological Laboratory and host methods workshops at the University of Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>This investigation will determine the magnitude and temporal dynamics of temperature-sensitive RNA editing in the octopus. The proposed experiments examine how quickly recoding events can change in response to acute temperature fluctuations at both the RNA and protein levels. Additional experiments will examine temperature-sensitive amino acid substitutions in kinesin and synaptotagmin, two important proteins for neuronal function, and ask whether they alter protein function to provide temperature compensation. The fellow seeks to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in biology at the Marine Biological Laboratory with a 3-point plan. Through a role on the MBL Diversity Committee, the fellow will 1) broaden career development opportunities for minorities already present at the MBL, 2) promote enrollment and funding opportunities at minority-serving institutions for world-renown MBL courses, and 3) train minority undergraduate students in molecular biology and approaches to whole organism physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these habitats have experienced widespread loss and fragmentation due to human activities. This loss threatens the services these ecosystems provide to humans as well as the extraordinary biodiversity of fishes and invertebrates that live within them. However, there is still a lot that is unknown about these habitats which makes it difficult to understand the likely impacts of habitat loss or the benefits of habitat restoration. This research focuses on habitat loss and fragmentation in coral reef ecosystems. The focus of the research is to understand how habitat loss and fragmentation affects the biodiversity of fish and crustaceans on coral reefs in the South Pacific. Because many creatures living within the coral offer important benefits to the coral such as defense from coral predators and removal of sedimentation, this research also seeks to better understand how changes in the biodiversity and abundance of fish and invertebrates associated with corals, affect the capacity of corals to withstand future impacts, such as sedimentation and outbreaks of coral-eating seastars. Understanding whether habitat loss alters the capacity of corals to withstand stress in an increasingly stressful world is critical to devise effective strategies to manage and protect coral reefs and the many services they provide to society. <br/><br/>Many marine systems are characterized by habitat-forming foundation species, which harbor a diversity of occupants, and whose dynamics are thought to drive resilience of entire ecosystems As a result, there is widespread concern over the ongoing loss and fragmentation of biogenic habitats such as seagrass beds, oyster reefs, kelp forests, and coral reefs. Yet, without a more complete understanding of marine landscape ecology, we struggle to predict how the degradation or restoration of habitat will alter ecosystem dynamics, function, and resilience. Most research in marine landscape ecology has focused on spatial patterns of occupant abundance and biodiversity; however, the causes and consequences of these patterns are rarely explored. An important but understudied consequence of variation in occupant density is that it may alter how occupants interact with their biogenic habitat. Because occupants can benefit biogenic habitat or harm biogenic habitat, changes in occupant density can affect habitat growth and survival. Consequently, habitat-driven variation in occupant density should feed back to alter habitat dynamics and the spatial patterning of the habitat. In summary, we are limited in our understanding of why patterns in landscape ecology exist, how these patterns alter the population dynamics and spatial patterns of the occupants as well as their habitat, and what the implications of habitat degradation or restoration will be. The central objective of this proposal is to examine the causes and consequences of the nonlinear relationship between occupant abundance and the amount of biogenic habitat.  Specifically, we will: (i) examine the habitat-based mechanisms that produce spatial variation in occupant density; (ii) quantify how habitat-driven occupant density feeds back to alter habitat growth and survival; and (iii) apply this knowledge to understand how bidirectional habitat-occupant interactions affect the long-term dynamics, create novel spatial patterns, and drive variation in how systems respond to and recover from disturbances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such nocturnal heavy precipitation contributes to nearly 80% of daily convective precipitation, critically affecting water resources availability, the economy, and the safety of the communities in the region. This nocturnal heavy precipitation is counterintuitive in the sense that the intensive convective activity over the Great Plains occurs at late night when the lower-troposphere is stably stratified, and the convective available potential energy is low. This paradoxical situation challenges the traditional understanding of development of severe convection yet also presents an opportunity for exploring new mechanisms for severe nocturnal convection and rainfall in the U.S. Great Plains. <br/><br/>The goal of this study is to examine a mechanism that initiates nocturnal convection in the absence of passage of fronts or convective complex with a low level of convective available potential energy in the lower troposphere. The significance of outcomes of this study is the exploring of a new mechanism for warm season severe convection and rainfall in the Great Plains at mid-night to early morning hours. The validation of the new mechanism will fill the gap in the knowledge of initiation of nocturnal convection in the absence of frontal boundaries and convective complex and will extend the knowledge of nocturnal convection beyond the traditional thinking. The findings will help improve model capabilities to predict the timing and intensity of severe convection and rainfall in the U.S. Great Plains. The broader impacts of this study also include its potential to improve the safety and wellbeing of the communities across the U.S. Great Plains and, through education, expanding local public schools' science education programs by engaging students in learning fluid dynamics and appreciating the impacts of geosciences in improving people's lives.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis is that the nocturnal intensification of the low-level southerly wind in the Great Plains is subject to Coriolis deflection, which would in turn lead to the development of a vortex rotating along the horizontal axis pointing to the north (the northern vortex). Interactions of the northern vortex with the wind blows from the Rockies generate a lift that can elevate air in the lower-troposphere high enough to initiate convection, responsible for heavy precipitation in the hours between mid-night and early morning in the Great Plains. The main research tasks are 1) identifying processes leading to development of the northern vortex; 2) quantifying the condition that creates the lift of the vortex; 3) quantifying the roles of the atmospheric moisture in generating the lift; and 4) identifying the missing or incorrectly described processes that have failed current models in reproducing the elevated convection of this kind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This reproductive isolation prevents interbreeding, allowing for the emergence of distinct species. This research project makes use of the tremendous species diversity present in the monkey flowers (Mimulus). Comparison of many pairs of species in this group will uncover the genetic changes responsible for and the evolutionary forces at work that generated reproductive isolation. Understanding the interactions between genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes that lead to species diversification will also contribute to agricultural breeding programs. The project includes efforts to educate grade school and high school students about evolution and the value of species diversity, and train undergraduate and graduate students in evolutionary biology and the molecular genetics of development.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on the evolution of F1 hybrid seed inviability, a relatively unstudied but potentially common reproductive barrier in flowering plants. This project integrates phylogenetic, population genetic, developmental, transcriptomic, and genome mapping approaches to systematically address whether hybrid seed failure is a key isolating mechanism driving population and species diversification across the genus Mimulus. The project will test the hypothesis that this form of reproductive isolation evolves rapidly via natural selection generated by parent-offspring conflict in all outbreeding flowering plant species. Such conflict-driven selection is expected to cause divergent evolution of the genetic control of endosperm development in seeds in different lineages via differential genomic imprinting, quickly leading to strong postzygotic isolation regardless of the ecological environments that the species experience. The main goals of this project are to determine the rate of evolution, strength, and importance of hybrid seed inviability in the speciation process across the genus Mimulus; to assess the developmental mechanisms and transcriptomic signatures of hybrid seed inviability, and finally to determine the genetic basis of hybrid seed inviability and the degree of parallelism in the genetic basis of speciation in this genus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this objective, we propose to establish the Data-Intensive Research And Computing (DIRAC) Research Training Group (RTG). The DIRAC RTG leverages strengths of the UC Merced Applied Mathematics faculty to provide undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers a training experience that prepares them for careers in academia, industry, and government. A key challenge is that computational and data-enabled sciences involve inextricable ties between mathematics, science, technology, and engineering. UC Merced Applied Mathematics is well positioned to address this challenge because of its three main approaches to science that will be at the core of this RTG: (1) modeling of physical and biological systems, (2) scientific computing, and (3) data analysis. To provide its trainees a collaborative training experience in computational and data-enabled sciences, the DIRAC RTG will foster Small Mentoring and Research Training (SMaRT) teams, which are vertically integrated, community-based mentoring structures, each centered on one of four research themes: (I) energy and the environment, (II) sensing and imaging, (III) mathematical biology, and (IV) numerical analysis. These SMaRT teams will provide support to individuals, guide their training, and produce a well-trained, nimble workforce that can contribute to the fast-paced modern computational research. Additionally, the DIRAC RTG is committed to serving the underrepresented and first-generation students that UC Merced Applied Mathematics actively recruits into its undergraduate and graduate programs. Built into each SMaRT Team are active measures for recruiting inclusive teams of trainees, providing continuous mentorship and support to retain these trainees, and developing the professional skills of trainees needed to succeed upon completion of this training program.<br/><br/>Computational and data sciences are new paradigms for scientific inquiry and discovery that incorporate mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge. Since computational and data-enabled sciences are relatively new, their natural and effective integration into existing training programs in mathematics remains to be perfected.  This RTG project brings together the entire Applied Mathematics faculty of UC Merced with the common goal of developing a modernized and comprehensive training program for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral associates that integrates these subjects in a natural and effective way and prepares the trainees for successful careers in academia, government, and industry in a broad range of fields. The proposed RTG project has three major components: (1) a balanced curriculum tightly integrated with research which is modernized to reflect the current needs in computational and data-enabled sciences; (2) a vertically integrated mentoring program that engages undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral associates, and faculty participants; and (3)  the development of extensive, dynamic, and supportive communities focused on education, research, and professional development. The thematic research areas considered focus on timely and important issues and are divided into (I) energy and the environment, (II) sensing and imaging, (III) mathematical biology, and (IV) numerical analysis. This training program focuses on enhancing each trainee's skills and experience in the process of research (as opposed to just the products of research) and provides practical teaching training, communication skills, and professional development. The activities in this RTG are crucial to making systematic improvements to the existing training program at UC Merced, which can then serve as a model for other programs. These institutional changes will profoundly transform mathematics programs and have long-lasting impact on training the future generations of computational and data-enabled scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As this population expands, we need to understand more about how these new immigrants become politically integrated into United States society. We know that social groups that succeed in terms of educational attainment and earnings typically have high levels of political participation. What is most perplexing about Asian Americans is that, despite their relative economic and educational success, they lag behind other racial groups in voter turnout. The most recent studies of this question have not produced adequate answers. This project will investigate the causes for lower Asian American voter turnout as well as provide a more detailed understanding of how Asian Americans understand and define participation in the public sphere. This latter aspect is important given that much of the potential for greater civic inclusion lies in the recognition of the diverse but often overlooked extra-institutional forms of political engagement more common among recent immigrants.  This project will provide political parties and our society generally with information useful in promoting  greater participation in the political process by facilitating greater engagement of civically-minded citizens, thus strengthening our democracy. <br/><br/><br/>This mixed-methods project will combine quantitative analysis of existing data sets with in-depth interviews.  The project will use The Current Population Survey between 2000 and 2014 to verify prior research concerning patterns of voter turnout among Asian Americans. The project will also analyze the 2016 National Asian American Survey to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms behind recent voter patterns, including forms of political participation other than actual voting. Finally, the project will conduct 90 interviews in a large city with subgroups of Asian Americans to capture these groups' perspectives on their political engagement and experiences in the public sphere.  After the interviews are transcribed, qualitative coding will produce common themes and concepts.  Atlas.ti will be used to organize, manage and analyze the data.  Findings from the project will show both overall patterns and subgroup differences in the motivations for political participation among Asian Americans, and test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms behind these patterns. Findings will inform theories in both sociology and political science related to political participation, especially the role of resources in motivating such participation.  Findings will also speak to sociological theories regarding ethnic group assimilation to better understand why Asian Americans assimilate readily socio-economically, but less readily politically. The findings will also speak to sociological theories regarding the role of culture in patterning public sphere behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine the impact of recent declines in state support for public universities on scientific research output.  Since the Great Recession, several states cut appropriations to higher education, and nineteen states have not restored funding to 2008 levels.  Yet few studies have examined the relationship between federal and non-federal research funding, and none have investigated the relationship between state funding for higher education and research output.  In addition, researchers have debated whether there are diminishing returns to science funding.  Diminishing returns occur when each additional dollar of funding results in fewer publications and citations.  The results of this research will allow policymakers to make informed decisions about the allocation of scarce funding resources to higher education at the state and federal levels.  <br/><br/>The proposed research will examine the effect of changes in support for higher education funding to examine the returns to science funding in terms of publications and citations across science and social science disciplines. First, the project will use new data that links publications, citations and grants to individual faculty members at research universities to model the returns to scale of science funding across several disciplines. Variation across these fields will shed light on the returns to scale in science funding.  Second, the project will examine whether state funding of higher education is a substitute or complement for federal research funding in the production of research output measured by publications and citations.  If state funding is a complement for federal research funding, one would expect that federal research dollars would fall in states that experienced budget cuts.  Third, the project will use individual level data on scientists and state budget shocks to higher education funding to examine the impact of faculty mobility on the research productivity of sending and receiving institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mechanism merges two transducers, one which converts mechanical shock to voltage and another which converts voltage to motion to open a micro-switch. The result is a self-operated sensor directly operated by mechanical shock when the shock goes beyond a threshold. Currently, shock sensors such as those in air-bag deployment devices need a processing unit to engage the device, which requires a complicated control system having risks of software and component failures. The system eliminates the need for signal processing units by synergistically connecting two transducers that overcome the limitations of each system. There is a gap in the knowledge of several key aspects of each transducer that this project will address. The system has promising applications in earthquake detection systems that need to trigger an immediate response to significant seismic activity such as shutting off power lines and sounding alarms. Wider applications include safety switches in the automotive industry and shipment monitors. To familiarize a broad range of students with transducers, educational activities will be undertaken that include hands-on experiences for local elementary schools and structured research projects for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the underlying multiphysics from the integration of triboelectric generators and levitation actuators.

Merging the two systems overcomes the limitations of each system. Despite much research on triboelectric materials, the coupled dynamic characteristics of triboelectric transducers and electrostatic actuators are unknown. The combined system contains mechanical and electrical components causing a sophisticated exchange of the energies between them that affects their normal behavior. This project will delineate the nonlinear interactions of the two systems using mathematical models, prototype fabrication and experimental verification.

These are new types of materials that have been recently proposed theoretically and are now beginning to be discovered. They are very poor conductors in their bulk but have highly conductive metallic surfaces. These materials are special in that their surface enjoys what is called topological protection, meaning that it cannot be changed without destroying the bulk material. In most materials, surfaces can be chemically altered as they tend to pick up impurities from the environment, which in turn interfere with how materials conduct electricity, a crucial feature for applications in any electronic device. However, the topologically protected surfaces of Weyl semimetals are robust to impurities. <br/><br/>This research project aims to develop methods for finding new Weyl semimetals, and for understanding their properties using computer-based simulations. The close competition between various degrees of freedom of the electrons in these materials makes their study particularly challenging, but also holds great promise for new functionalities.<br/><br/>The research will lead to new methods, algorithms, and software that will enhance and simplify our ability to carry out material-specific studies and to promote the gradual improvement of materials by computer-aided design, thus shortening currently expensive and inefficient trial-and-error procedures.

Guided by similarities between crystal structures and topological features of known systems, realizations of the band inversion mechanism between electronic states of different parity, hybridization effects between partially filled strongly correlated states with filled or empty topological energy bands, chemical valence arguments and physical intuition, a high-throughput screening of materials for their topological properties will be performed in the infinite space of chemically allowed compounds using computer-based simulations.<br/><br/>These findings will allow identifying new topological materials, such as Weyl semimetals, and, in particular, those with only Weyl nodes and no other Fermi surface states. Such discoveries could motivate further experimental studies of the chiral anomaly and topological superconductivity. Theoretical and computational approaches to predict and study complex behavior in these systems would potentially influence the design of quantum materials with unique characteristics that rely on topological protection of states, which are at the frontier of materials science.<br/><br/>The research will lead to new methods, algorithms, and software that will enhance and simplify our ability to carry out material-specific studies and to promote the gradual improvement of materials by computer-aided design, thus shortening currently expensive and inefficient trial-and-error procedures.

Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.<br/><br/><br/>This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It loses its capability of making predictions in extremely strong gravitational fields, e.g. inside a black hole or at the very early stage of the universe near the big bang. One of the most fundamental open questions in physics is how to complete GR in order to predict physics in an extremely strong gravitational field. The complete theory of gravity that we are searching for is called ""Quantum Gravity"". The theory of Quantum Gravity should play a crucial role in describing the physics inside black holes and helping us to understand the early universe near the big bang.

Just as human left and right hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images, biomolecules such as protein and DNA and other biologically-active molecules are chiral. The nonsuperimposable structural forms of these molecules are referred to as enantiomers. Artificially synthesized molecules are often a mixture of enantiomers. The ability to separate the mixtures into enantiomerically-pure compounds, or a single enantiomer, is particularly important to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, as one enantiomer may have an entirely different effect than another. Yet, enantiomeric separations remain a costly aspect of the chemical production process. With support from the Molecular Separations program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and partial co-funding from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry, the PIs will examine the application of a novel and potentially generic principle for the separation of enantiomers using magnetic solid surfaces. In chiral molecules, applying a voltage affects how strongly the molecule interacts with a ferromagnetic surface. The strength of the interaction depends on whether the molecule is left-handed or right-handed. To separate enantiomers using magnetic surfaces and applied voltages, however, the chiral molecules and surface must be in direct contact. The goal of the project is to establish the molecular parameters affecting the separation and to identify the ideal magnetic materials. The ability to separate enantiomers using such an approach has the potential to reduce the cost of producing drugs and other agriculturally-relevant molecules, improving human health and promoting sustainability.<br/><br/>The proposed activity builds on fundamental insights into the chiral induced spin selectivity effect and the recent finding that charge polarization in chiral molecules is accompanied by spin polarization. Recent results show that chiral molecules enantiospecifically adsorb on ferromagnets, where the adsorbed enantiomer is determined by the direction of magnetization of the substrate. The molecule's spin polarization affects the adsorption energy with a magnetic surface primarily through a change in the Pauli repulsion. The spin polarization changes the symmetry constraints on the electronic wavefunction, and this strongly affects the Pauli repulsion energy as the electron cloud of the molecule overlaps with the electronic wavefunctions of the substrate. Based on this behavior, a new approach to enantioselective separations and purification using magnetic materials will be developed. This goal will be accomplished through four objectives: 1) examining how the enantioselective adsorption of chiral molecules depends on the molecular properties; 2) examining different chromatographic constructs for separating mixtures of enantiomers; 3) exploring and defining the experimental conditions for efficient separations; and 4) examining the use of crystallization with magnetic surfaces for separations. The research will result in fundamental understanding of enantiomeric separations using magnetic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, the Invisible Hand of the Market suggests that in other settings, self-interested behavior leads to positive outcomes. What distinguishes these settings? One important differentiator is whether there is a diversity of interests. Another important ingredient is that the setting be large, in the sense that individual participants form only a small part of the setting (or the market, in particular). This project will be seeking to better understand large settings by quantifying the inefficiencies that arise due to self-interested behavior, and more specifically the rate at which these inefficiencies shrink as the setting size grows. The project will seek broadly applicable results, but will make this concrete by focusing on some specific settings including: (1) Price adjustment in market settings; one issue will be to identify when and why price adjustment algorithms lead to the desirable outcomes promised by the Invisible Hand. (2) Settings in which decisions do not involve payments, such as admissions to universities; the goal will be to develop plausible models which yield fair outcomes and which allow sensible student and university strategies to be explored. This genre of problem, involving human behavior together with computational concerns, appears to have broad appeal, both to undergraduate and graduate students; accordingly, the project will seek to involve students of all levels.<br/><br/>While this notion of largeness has been well-studied in the economics field, this has been mainly in continuum settings or as in-the-limit results.  In contrast, this project will seek quantifiable results, i.e. results that express a trade-off between the setting size and the quality of an outcome, and in particular settings for which there are polynomial trade-offs between the setting size and the quality of an outcome. One broad question is to identify conditions that allow continuum and in-the-limit results to be systematically converted to quantified results. More specific questions concern whether large market settings lead to robust versions of tatonnement (this is the family of price adjustment algorithms in which the price of a good is increased when the demand exceeds the supply, and reduced in the opposite case), robust in the sense that they are relatively parameter-free. The ultimate goal of this line of work is to provide an algorithmic explanation of price convergence to near-equilibrium states in a model which incorporates self-interested behavior. A second, quite distinct thrust will seek to explore  conventional advice in large stable-matching-type settings, e.g., for students applying to college, namely advice such as: include one or two stretch schools and a safety school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will help address this challenge by studying nuclear matter under extreme conditions such as at super hot temperatures or in super strong magnetic fields, which are available via high energy collider experiments. The PI will study the topological component of QCD, characterize the properties of this component via collider experimental data, and seek direct evidence of its presence through a novel transport phenomenon called the Chiral Magnetic Effect. The PI will mentor students engaged in this research at both graduate and undergraduate levels. In addition the project will develop outreach activities that bring current research to K-12 students as well as the general public through a variety of local events and online platforms. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in its quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase at extremely high temperatures, such as those produced in today's laboratory experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The key approach is to study the properties of the gluon topological component as well as to search for its manifestation via novel transport phenomenon related to quark chirality. Three specific topics will be explored. The first is to develop a statistical ensemble model of the topological component and study how it can explain the QCD confinement transition and quantitatively describe relevant lattice QCD data. The second is to quantify the contributions to key transport properties of QGP from the topological component by systematical comparison with experimental data utilizing Beyesian inference methodology.

Countless hours and productivity in corporations are lost when employees search for a small, specific video clip within a larger video asset to meet their business needs, costing institutions valuable time and money.  Through the enhanced discoverability within videos that the results of this project will provide, many industries such as education, media, online gaming, and others will benefit from enhanced efficiencies in publishing and video search results better reflecting user intent.  The benefits of this project are not confined to enterprises.  Society at large can benefit from a greater accessibility of video within archives that were previously unavailable, which can be used to create a society better-informed on world events and develop education and skills as the world's video archives that were once undiscoverable by the general public are made accessible.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a video understanding framework and knowledge graph to better enable video search and discovery for enterprise video archives and live stream video. Leveraging multimodal data and domain specific structured ontologies provided by content creators and data maintainers, this project proposes to develop four new machine learning and computer vision technologies.  Firstly, a webly supervised content-based retrieval system for video will be created in order to build classifiers without being provided annotated training data, effectively solving the video classification data cold start problem. Second, the project will build a multimodal ontology mapping system to enable mapping semantic concepts external and novel to our current technologies. Furthermore, to provide the ability to understand and formalize object relationships temporally, an Allen interval algebra module for video will be developed; combining it with knowledge relational learning in order to learn temporal relationships between objects that comprise its knowledge graph. Finally, to qualify the action relationships between people/objects in the developed knowledge graph, a holistic video modeling approach will be developed and applied to action/event recognition and other tasks, such as captioning or titling, expanding a key recognition capability to complete the knowledge graph.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The unique properties of different types of crystals are a result of not only their chemical compositions, but also the precise and specific arrangement of the constituent atoms. As nanosized crystals (of dimensions of only about 1/1000 times the width of a strand of hair), these diverse properties could lead to applications as far reaching as earth abundant and active industrial catalysts, new cancer treatments, magnetic storage media, better batteries, and inexpensive and efficient solar panels. Before any of this is possible, the routes to synthesize these crystals at the nanoscale must first be discovered because the extreme conditions of geology cannot be easily replicated in the chemistry laboratory or industrial facilities.  The research group of Professor Janet Macdonald at Vanderbilt University seeks to understand how the precise placements of atoms in nano-sized rocks can be controlled.  Experiments are designed to interrogate what happens to organic molecules and metal atoms when they react and how to control the precise placement of atoms in these nano-sized rocks.  The ultimate goal is to make all the phases of crystals that geology does, and possibly be able to design and prepare crystals with new phases. The project also examines how the surfaces of small pieces of iron oxide pigments bind to granite surfaces in the remarkably durable rock paintings of the Anishinaabe, an indigenous people of the United States and Canada. The goal here is to rediscover the lost technique for rock art and return it to the Anishinaabe. The project supports the training of researchers in high school, undergraduate and graduate student levels. Established and new connections encourage Anishinaabe researchers to take part in the research. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project uses libraries of organic molecules that contain sulfur and selenium atoms as precursors to obtain the diverse crystals made of these materials. A wide, sweeping and systematic study of the phase-controlled synthesis of iron, cobalt, nickel and copper chalcogenide nanocrystals is being performed.  Libraries of organochalcogenides are employed to separate the roles of kinetic rates from the decomposition mechanisms in phase-determination. Organic reaction products are identified to decipher the mechanisms of decomposition of the organochalcogenides on the metals and deduce the impact of these mechanisms on phase control. In a second aim, organoselenol and diselenide chemistry facilitates polytypic selection in the transition metal chalcogenides. In situ solution 1H and 77Se NMR spectroscopy of nanocrystal reactions are used to understand how the organochalcogenide chemistry influences the polytypism in nanocrystal synthesis. In the final thrust, adherence of hematite pigments to silica is studied under varied application conditions precisely controlled using laboratory chemicals.

The CMS detector at the LHC is one of the world's most powerful and sophisticated cameras, observing the collisions of protons and recording the outcomes for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. The members of the high energy physics group at Rutgers University have been crucial to the construction, maintenance, and continued improvement of the device itself. They have initiated and guided several studies of the data collected, including ones that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces, or even glimpses of new fundamental particles. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations. <br/><br/>The Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

This population, potentially the largest in the world and at the southern limit of the species' range, has doubled in size over the past 20 years while most other colonies in the region have remained stable or declined. New information gained from this project will be useful in understanding the potential ofclimate-driven changes in terrestrial nesting habitats for impacting Adelie penguins in the future. The project will produce, and document, open-source software tools to help automate image processing for automated counting of Adelie penguins. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and contribute materials to ongoing educational outreach programs based on related penguin science projects. Information gained from this project will contribute towards building robust, cost-effective protocols for monitoring Adelie penguin populations, a key ecosystem indicator identified in the draft Ross Sea Marine Protected Area Research and Monitoring Plan. <br/><br/><br/>Adelie penguins are important indicators of ecosystem function and change in the Southern Ocean. In addition to facing rapid changes in sea ice and other factors in their pelagic environment, their terrestrial nesting habitat is also changing. Understanding the species' response to such changes is critical for assessing its ability to adapt to the changing climate. The objective of this project is to test several hypotheses about the influence of fine-scale nesting habitat, nest density, and breeding success of Adelie penguins in the Ross Sea region. To accomplish this, the project will develop algorithms to improve efficiency and safety of surveys by unmanned aerial systems and develop and disseminate an automated image processing workflow. Images collected during several UAV surveys will be used to estimate the number of nesting adults and chicks produced, as well as estimate nesting density in different parts of two colonies on Ross Island, Antarctica, that differ in size by two orders of magnitude. Imagery will be used to generate high resolution digital surface/elevation models that will allow terrain variables like flood risk and terrain complexity to be derived. Combining the surface model with the nest and chick counts at the two colonies will provide relationships between habitat covariates, nest density, and breeding success. The approaches developed will enable Adelie penguin population sizes and potentially several other indicators in the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area Research and Monitoring Plan to be determined and evaluated. The flight control algorithms developed have the potential to be used for many types of surveys, especially when large areas need to be covered in a short period with extreme weather potential and difficult landing options. Aerial images and video will be used to create useable materials to be included in outreach and educational programs. The automated image processing workflow and classification models will be developed as open source software and will be made freely available for others addressing similar wildlife monitoring challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plate tectonics is only known to occur on Earth, but not on Venus and Mars, and whether Earth always had plate tectonics in its 4.5 billion-year history is unknown. The emergence of plate tectonics on Earth depends on how rocks in the cold uppermost layers of the mantle - the lithosphere - deform.  As rocks deform they can weaken through the process of damage, which concentrates deformation, resulting in more damage, and so on. This positive feedback focuses lithospheric deformation into weak narrow plate boundaries, which are the locus of most seismic and volcanic activity. This project will develop and apply the physics of how mineral grains in rocks are damaged (termed ""grain-damage"") through combined theoretical and laboratory approaches. When mineral grains are deformed they accumulate defects, which eventually leads to grains breaking down into smaller grains, and this in turn makes the rocks weaker. This process is evident in rocks called mylonites that are often found at plate tectonic boundaries. This project will use grain damage physics to understand how and when plate tectonics arose on early Earth.  The project will also study how damage in grains influences cycles of earthquakes at plate boundaries, specifically how rocks weaken, recover and transmit stress to other rocks and eventually trigger more earthquakes. Plate boundary processes have a significant human impact, including evolution of plate boundary fault systems and earthquake recurrence. The project promotes diversity through the support and professional development of two early career female scientists, specifically with interdisciplinary training in theoretical and experimental methods. The project will also involve organization of a symposium on the evolution of plate boundaries for students and young scientists, and will contribute new scientific materials to education and outreach activities at an established scientific visualization facility. <br/><br/>This project will advance the study of lithospheric grain-scale physics and deformation mechanisms, and their application to the generation and operation of plate tectonics. The PI's will extend the grain damage theory for lithospheric weakening and plate boundary formation to include mineralogical phase mixing and dislocation dynamics in polymineralic materials, with calibration and testing by rock deformation experiments. These new developments are necessary to address two major scientific questions:<br/>1. Emergence of plate tectonics: How did tectonic plate boundaries form in the ancient Archean Earth? Did thermal and petrological evolution in the early Earth, namely cooling, decreasing crustal production, and changes in lithospheric composition, affect localization of deformation in the lithosphere and the emergence of plate tectonics? Specifically, the PI's hypothesize that temperature and melting affect mineral composition, which can then influence rock weakening through the positive feedback of grain damage and mixing between petrological phases.<br/>2. Post-seismic creep and lithospheric shear zones: How does transient ductile behavior in the lithosphere, with associated changes in microstructure like grain-size and dislocation density, influence the accumulation, transmission and release of stress following an earthquake? How does this response affect earthquake recurrence cycles and triggering? Does inherited lithospheric weakness, and thus age of a plate boundary, influence post-seismic recovery and earthquake cycles?<br/><br/>To address these questions, the investigators will connect new developments in grain-scale physics to plate-scale geodynamic models using experimentally determined rheological laws. These multi-scale models will provide the platform for coupling plate-boundary formation to thermo-chemical evolution of the upper mantle, and to seismogenic behavior in the crust. The ultimate scientific goal of this project is to understand emergence of plate tectonics on early Earth, and how plate boundary evolution and behavior influences post-seismic response and earthquake cycles. These issues span the time scales of the evolution of Earth's surface in deep time, the development of the neotectonic environment, and the behavior of seismically active zones. The proposed work will use theory and experiments to better understand Earth's tectonic processes on the geological and human time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the hazards driven by weather patterns, ground deformation due to landslides has immense global impacts. Large portions of the Earth's surface are at risk to ground failures, affecting a considerable fraction of the world's population. Landslides cause a global annual death toll of several thousand and financial losses of more than $1B per year in the United States alone. The most formidable challenge in predicting ground failures derives from their ability to suddenly accelerate despite the lack of observed precursors. In fact, natural slopes can deform in multiple ways, sometimes by displaying slow movements, while at other times moving rapidly in a fluidized state. Such modes of deformation coexist at the same site, affect portions of terrain proximal to one another, and may be experienced by the same hillslopes at different times. The current scarcity of predictive large-scale ground deformation models is largely a consequence of the poor spatial coverage of ground-based monitoring data. To overcome these obstacles, this project will rely on technological advances in remote sensing that allow the detection of rainfall patterns and ground movements at spatiotemporal resolutions that were unthinkable just a decade ago. These observational advances have the potential to unleash new formulation, calibration and validation possibilities for hydrologic and ground deformation models by means of abundant, openly-available, spatially-distributed information. Specifically, the project is motivated by the idea that pre-failure deformations have much to say about when, how, and why ground failure occurs, and aims to demonstrate that analyzing the deformation signature of the ground is the key to explain why hillslopes fail in different ways when subjected to variable weather patterns. If successful, this project will lead to new ways to decode the physical origin of ground instability and define measurable precursors of catastrophic landslide triggering, thus potentially inspiring the design of innovative real-time early warning systems able to better protect human life and infrastructure. <br/><br/>During the course of this project, the interaction between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere will be studied from a new multi-disciplinary perspective. Specifically, the project will formulate: (1) rheological laws for geomaterials able to explain variations in landslide velocity resulting from dynamically changing environmental conditions; (2) a multiscale weather-hydrology simulation platform able to quantify spatially heterogeneous rainfall inputs and soil moisture at the scale of mountain ranges; (3) landscape-scale geomechanical models able to reproduce the evolution of remotely sensed deformations via force-transfer laws between proximal portions of terrain; (4) a network theory for surface processes based on the physics of complex systems, by which patterns can be identified and precursors of runaway instability defined. Such a combination of methods will provide a comprehensive representation of landslide dynamics, thus improving our ability to forecast landslides and mitigate hazards at the landscape scale. Most importantly, it will provide innovative tools to address open questions in the domain of hazard forecasting, such as: (i) Can we use landscape-scale observations to infer the rheology of hillslopes? (ii) Which landscape-scale measurements are most useful for predicting the fate of incipient landslides? (iii) Is the concurrent collection of spatially-distributed data of rainfall patterns and displacement rates sufficient to identify landslide precursors? These questions will be answered by combining data from state-of-the-art remote sensing tools (e.g., satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar, high-resolution digital elevation models, and weather radar) with physics-based constitutive laws for soil and rock deformation, atmospheric-hydrologic models, and complex network theories. Rich datasets available for a variety of geological settings and earthen materials within and outside the United States will be used to test the predictive capabilities of the proposed approaches. This strategy will offer unique opportunities to validate the concepts at the core of the project and test their applicability to a wide range of geomorphic and climatic contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The social science approach to this work includes<br/>understanding the perceived barriers and benefits of grid infrastructure that can increase resilience during<br/>extreme weather events and routine storms. Field data, enabled by the participation of a utility affected by<br/>Hurricane Michael, will play a crucial role in defining the solutions proposed using resilient microgrids.<br/>The currently affected electric grid in the Florida panhandle, combined with the heightened need for<br/>reliable access to electricity, provides a unique opportunity to re-engineer this critical infrastructure using<br/>self-reliant, local, and resilient concepts such as the microgrid. In that regard, the team will use its<br/>extensive body of work in the field of electric power microgrids, aimed at normal and disaster-recovery<br/>modes of operation, to fulfill the requirements of a stable, reliable, and economical source of electricity<br/>supply to communities. The work will consider social factors by extensive engagement with the people on<br/>the ground including the more vulnerable populations affected along with those most involved in current<br/>efforts in providing relief. This information will be used in a multi-criteria based prioritized design of<br/>microgrids for minimizing fragility, including sustainability measures, and increasing resilience. This idea<br/>of engineering the grid will create a template for Smart electric infrastructures, especially in the Atlantic<br/>coast and Gulf of Mexico regions, so that they can all become prepared for future onslaughts from<br/>hurricanes. The team includes engineers and a behavioral psychologist that are experts in electrical power<br/>systems design and operation, resilient and sustainable systems engineering, and surveys-based<br/>approaches to identification and quantification of barriers and benefits. Collaborations with a municipal<br/>utility from the FL panhandle, entities engaged in Hurricane Maria related rebuilding efforts in Puerto<br/>Rico, a national lab, and an international academic institution strengthen our team.<br/><br/>The significant and transformative components of this RAPID proposal are: (a) engagement of local<br/>communities and utility to assess electricity supply needs; (b) engagement of relief/recovery providers in<br/>the area for coordinating solutions; (c) design of specialized microgrids using multi-criteria based<br/>priority-oriented approaches; (d) co-optimization of design objectives including fragility, sustainability,<br/>and resilience of microgrids; and, (e) creation of template for resilience plan for hurricane-prone electric<br/>grids. We will achieve the goals of this RAPID proposal by utilizing real data gathered from the ground,<br/>basing our design and operation principles on sound mathematics and engineering, modeling and<br/>simulating on realistic test systems, and proposing validation techniques for future implementation in the<br/>field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much research has been focused on the study of PDEs on smooth spaces, where the local geometry has a very simple model, however singularities can arise naturally in nature, the most well known being black holes. The current research project focuses on the study of PDEs on such singular spaces. This study will have applications in algebraic geometry, where singular spaces play a central role in modern research, as well as in the theory of partial differential equations. At the same time, singular spaces occur naturally as limits of families of smooth spaces, which could collapse in certain directions for instance. In this way the proposed research will shed new light on the behavior of such families. Aside from pursuing these research projects, the PI will continue training PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition the PI will also co-organize a yearly summer workshop for<br/>undergraduate students aimed at conveying ideas in geometry to them which do not typically appear in the undergraduate curriculum. The PI will also co-organize a yearly bridge program aimed at helping incoming graduate students with diverse backgrounds get up to speed, to ensure their success.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to investigate singularities in Kahler geometry from different points of view. On the one hand, singularities can arise in the limit of a sequence of smooth spaces, and it is important to understand the structure of such limit spaces. The PI will study the question of when the limit space can be identified with a singular Kahler space, building on work of Donaldson-Sun as well as Liu and the PI. Of particular interest are non-collapsed limit spaces of Kahler manifolds with Ricci curvature bounds, however the PI will also investigate the much less understood collapsed limit spaces. In a related direction, the PI will study canonical metrics, such as Kahler-Einstein metrics, on singular complex varieties, in particular the behavior of such metrics near the singular set. A good understanding of the geometry of such singular metrics would lead to applications of differential geometric techniques to the algebraic geometry of singular varieties. Finally, in relation to the collapsing theory of Kahler manifolds, the PI will study the construction of canonical metrics on fibrations that are almost collapsed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For almost every major societal issue -- from biodiversity conservation to cybersecurity, from considering how robotics will change the ways we live, to genetic engineering or to coastal resilience and food security -- there is a science center, national park, natural history museum, a zoo, or an aquarium hosting an exhibit or citizen science project, convening a dialogue program, or planning a community initiative related to that topic. What have we learned from these efforts? What do we know about how ISLs are engaging with and addressing socio-scientific concerns? Where are the gaps in understanding about what works and what doesn't? For example: Is STEM knowledge more approachable when situated within a social question? Are socio-scientific concerns more approachable when viewed through a STEM lens? Are there heuristics or guiding principles that can maximize the impact of these efforts?  With increasingly sophisticated methodologies for conducting research syntheses, it is now possible to mine disparate studies, explore relationships between variables, and examine trends within and across groups of studies. Taking the opportunity to aggregate what we know is critical for improving public audience experience and institutional outcomes.<br/><br/>For purposes of this research, societal challenge is defined as a social problem where: STEM knowledge and scientific reasoning are necessary to understand and to respond; and there are claims or warrants for ISL's to engage in the problem. Three bodies of peer and field reviewed literature (peer-reviewed journals, graduate theses, and evaluation reports of nationally-funded projects) provide the source for studies to be included in the research synthesis. The team's approach contains several cycles starting with a search by combinations of keywords (e.g. cybersecurity, coastal resilience, social problems, social issues, science controversies, public polls) and a review of the Table of Contents of approximately 30 journals (such as Curator: The Museum Journal, Museums & Social Issues, or Visitor Studies) and archives (such as informalscience.org) that publish or archive ISL research. Subsequent cycles will (1) search journals cited from initial items retrieved until no new concepts or projects emerge; (2) review grants awarded through NSF and IMLS; and (3) examine peer-reviewed articles related to projects that may show up in the literature of other disciplines. Studies will be classified using a scheme that includes metadata (date, source of publication and keywords) and categories suggested by the research questions (e.g., intended audience, STEM discipline(s), types of impact, intervention format, societal issue). <br/><br/>Next, studies will be assessed for inclusion in the analysis by evaluating their relevance (sources and evidence of claims), usefulness (contains adequate information for analysis purposes), and clarity of methodology(ies) used. NVIVO software will be used to manage the analysis of the literature. The coding system will draw on theoretical constructs (e.g., social phenomenology, issues framing, rhetoric, social problems claims), the research questions, and iterations of mapping and exploring the literature. Advisors with expertise in socio-scientific research, public engagement with science, and evaluation will review and inform the coding plan; an external panel will assist in finalizing the coding plan. Descriptive and correlational analysis will be conducted to identify patterns, themes, and trends and to examine relationships between groups of data.  The interpretation process will involve the PIs and the advisors exploring implications and conclusions. Outputs and activities under this award include the research synthesis report and several research briefs as well as researcher-practitioner webinars to share the research. <br/><br/>The professional audiences for this research are: (a) individuals working with ISL organizations, particularly practitioners who engage public audiences through exhibits or education programs, and those who set direction or policy; (b) researchers and evaluators; and (c) university students and faculty associated with museum studies or STEM disciplines that contain a public communications focus. ASC is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been filled over and replaced with neighborhoods.  Such geomorphic changes increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides.  Similarly, sea level rise and climate-modulated variations in storm characteristics such as intensity, size and track path also alter flood risk.  The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which these geomorphic and climatic changes alter flood risk.  This goal will be met using a combination of computational modeling, historical climate and storm surge data analysis, and theory-based synthesis.  The study will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate and several graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented groups.  It will improve the well-being of communities within urbanized harbors and estuaries by highlighting coastal development practices that can worsen coastal flooding.  The project plan increases scientific literacy and engagement, and connects the research to applications through interactions with local stakeholders and governments, as well as the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers.<br/><br/>The project will improve the understanding and separation of climatic and geomorphic factors in coastal flooding through several elements of novel research and technical innovation.  The investigators will use a unique tide-gauge data set that extends back to the 19th century together with contemporary, retrospective, and idealized hydrodynamic models to elucidate system sensitivities.  Well-known, simplified insights into tidal dynamics will be tested for storm surge, then used to help interpret how altered local topography, bathymetry and wetland area have changed frictional damping and long-wave mechanics.  A combined analysis of climate, storm characteristics, and morphologic change will identify the modes and pathways through which climate variability and bathymetric change modulate storms surges.  Advanced non-stationary univariate and multivariate statistical models will be developed and employed to incorporate these changes and assess how statistical properties relevant for coastal design and risk assessments respond.  A flood model inter-comparison workshop will help quantify relevant modeling sensitivities, which will help to improve estuary and floodplain predictions for the academic and operational forecasting community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This reproductive isolation prevents interbreeding, allowing for the emergence of distinct species. This research project makes use of the tremendous species diversity present in the monkey flowers (Mimulus). Comparison of many pairs of species in this group will uncover the genetic changes responsible for and the evolutionary forces at work that generated reproductive isolation. Understanding the interactions between genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes that lead to species diversification will also contribute to agricultural breeding programs. The project includes efforts to educate grade school and high school students about evolution and the value of species diversity, and train undergraduate and graduate students in evolutionary biology and the molecular genetics of development.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on the evolution of F1 hybrid seed inviability, a relatively unstudied but potentially common reproductive barrier in flowering plants. This project integrates phylogenetic, population genetic, developmental, transcriptomic, and genome mapping approaches to systematically address whether hybrid seed failure is a key isolating mechanism driving population and species diversification across the genus Mimulus. The project will test the hypothesis that this form of reproductive isolation evolves rapidly via natural selection generated by parent-offspring conflict in all outbreeding flowering plant species. Such conflict-driven selection is expected to cause divergent evolution of the genetic control of endosperm development in seeds in different lineages via differential genomic imprinting, quickly leading to strong postzygotic isolation regardless of the ecological environments that the species experience. The main goals of this project are to determine the rate of evolution, strength, and importance of hybrid seed inviability in the speciation process across the genus Mimulus; to assess the developmental mechanisms and transcriptomic signatures of hybrid seed inviability, and finally to determine the genetic basis of hybrid seed inviability and the degree of parallelism in the genetic basis of speciation in this genus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While progress has been made towards understanding how the mechanical properties of the tissue change during wound healing, much less is known about how local remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at the cell level during would healing leads to the new mechanical properties at the tissue level. The objective of this project is to understand how the extracellular matrix (ECM) is remodeled at the microscale by fibroblasts, and how these changes of the ECM lead to the observed changes at the tissue (macro) scale.  This will be tackled through a combination of experimental and computational modeling efforts.  The framework will increase knowledge about how the way in which cells sense and respond to their mechanical environment at the microscale is linked to tissue level growth and remodeling.  By advancing understanding in this area, it may be possible to translate the knowledge to improved interventions to support wound healing - a key problem in medicine.  In order to further broaden the impact of the award, the open-source software developed through this research will be made available to the community through Github.  In addition, the researchers will organize a workshop at a national conference focused on multiscale modeling of biological systems in order to train the next generation of scientists. The work will further be complemented with educational and mentoring activities aimed at increasing representation of minorities by continuing to participate in the Purdue?s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship and Pathways to the Faculty Programs. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to elucidate how the underlying cellular events at the microscale are connected to the macroscale mechanics during would healing. It is hypothesized that growth and remodeling at the macroscale can be predicted with a multiscale model based on microscale ECM remodeling.  This process is expected to be dependent on fiber degradation, fiber deposition, and cell-driven contraction. In Objective 1, the project will connect a finite element tissue level model to a detailed microscale model where a fiber network is remodeled by a fibroblast population represented as agents. In Objective 2, the growth and remodeling of fibrin and collagen gels seeded with fibroblasts subjected to an initial deformation and controlled cytokine concentration will be tracked for days to weeks. These measurements will be used to calibrate the computational model. The model will be further validated in Objective 3 by experimentally perturbing the system to alter collagen deposition, fiber degradation, and cell contractility. Finally, the project will create an in vitro wound model consisting of a fibrin domain inside a collagen gel and compare changes in geometry with the computational model's prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  Understanding the genetics that determine how organisms adapt to a changing environment is a challenging problem in evolutionary biology, but essential for predicting future evolutionary change.  The Fellow will use laboratory evolution experiments to determine the long-term evolutionary response of yeast populations, reproducing in different ways, when exposed to environmental stressors. To increase participation from members of underrepresented groups in biology, the Fellow will conduct workshops in collaboration with the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) at Oregon State University to train undergraduates from such groups in computational methods common in biological data science. <br/><br/>Findings from laboratory evolution experiments suggest a fundamental difference in the genetics of adaptation between populations of organisms that reproduce by mitosis or budding versus those that involve meiosis. Adaptation in the former is fueled by de novo beneficial mutation, while standing genetic variation drives the process in the latter. Experimental study systems involving meiosis are required to model evolutionary change in higher eukaryotic organisms using this mode of reproduction.  However, experiments that feature such systems are limited by scale; carrying out powerful experiments is difficult with complex eukaryotes.  Thus, there is a need for large, highly-replicated experiments that feature reproduction involving meiosis.  In addition, despite strong evidence that changes in gene regulation drive adaptation to selective pressures, laboratory evolution experiments rarely feature gene expression assays. The Fellow seeks to address these gaps with evolution experiments employing Saccharomyces cerevisiae to address the following questions: (1) How repeatable is the evolutionary response across a range of selective pressures? (2) How do patterns of gene expression change across different stages of adaptation? And (3) What are the relative contributions of changes in cis and trans regulation in driving adaptation? The Fellow will recruit students from OSU's LSAMP program to contribute to this research endeavor as a means of further promoting the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon-carbon bonds are an essential part of almost all organic chemicals. These important bonds form the backbone of most medicines and plastics (polymers) and thus are produced on massive scales.  Dr. Dong?s research focuses on forming carbon-carbon bonds from simple, inexpensive and non-toxic stating materials without also producing by-products which must be separated and/or discarded. This approach follows the principles of ?Green Chemistry? in that the new synthetic routes to commodity and specialty chemicals are more environmentally friendly. The research grant also supports the education of students at many levels.  Professor Dong is actively engaged in the ""ChiS&E"" program to provide early chemistry education to Chicago public middle-school students.  He is also involved in the Collegiate Scholars Program to teach high school students and the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) to offer laboratory research experiences to undergraduate students. These outreach activities encourage a diverse group students to explore careers in science and engineering while learning and actively contributing to research.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop byproduct-free ketone-olefin coupling reactions via transition metal (TM)-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond activation.  These approaches could serve as more environmentally-friendly approaches to access alkylated ketones. The research plan employs bifunctional templates to enable enamine/TM or imine/TM cooperative catalysis. The team's objectives are first, to develop a direct branched-selective alpha-alkylation of ketones with simple olefins via enamine/TM cooperative catalysis and second, to develop a direct alkylation of ketones with simple olefins via imine/TM cooperative catalysis. Carbonyl functionalization plays a central role in organic synthesis. Enolate alkylation and conjugate (alkyl) addition represent two common and important approaches for introducing alkyl groups at carbonyl positions.. Notably, these reactions are not economically- or environmentally-friendly processes mainly due to the use of stoichiometric halogen-based alkylating agents and/or stoichiometric organometallic species. Here, Professor Dong and his team employ a TM-catalyzed enamine or imine-mediated C-H functionalization strategy to achieve ketone alkylation using simple unactivated olefins as the alkylating agents. This approach is considered more sustainable than current methods because stoichiometric by-products are not generated and the reaction conditions are generally pH- and redox-neutral, thereby tolerating a broad range of functional groups.  From a practical viewpoint, olefins are typically a cheaper and more readily available feedstock than the corresponding alkyl halides or organometallic species. Byproduct-free ketone alkylation methods using regular olefins as the alkylating agents are developed through the new bifunctional catalysts. Professor Dong and his team are engaged in several outreach activities, including introducing grade school students to chemical concepts.  Integrating educational activities of students from diverse age groups and backgrounds into the existing research program has been a primary goal of the research group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wilson of Michigan State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry. Dr. Wilson develops computer-based methods to better understand properties of molecules that have important uses such as in sensors, optical probes in medical applications, photocatalysts, optical switches, and organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) used in lighting, mobile phones, and televisions.  Her project combines a myriad of computational chemistry methods grounded in quantum mechanics in what is termed a composite approach to predict energies and other properties of molecules containing heavy elements.  Greater understanding of the properties of these molecules aids in the rational design of next-generation devices, and helps to identify strategies to replace rare components in devices that are not easily recyclable.  Some of the heaviest elements that comprise molecules are very difficult to characterize and can require a very significant amount of computer time, memory, and storage space to model. In some cases, the elements cannot be modeled due to the limitation of resources and complexity of the molecules.  Dr. Wilson and her research group develops methods that enable the properties of these heavy element molecules to be described with significant efficiency and accuracy.  The training of students from high school to graduate school is a top priority in Dr. Wilson's research group, as is increasing and advancing underrepresented minorities in STEM through a variety of outreach events and research opportunities. The research enables students to gain experience in computational methods development and applications, manuscript preparation, and presentation of research results at scientific conferences, preparing these early career computational chemists to thrive in their future scientific careers. In addition, increasing and advancing underrepresented minorities in STEM is a continuing priority in the Wilson laboratory.<br/><br/>From the design of new molecules to the development of new photophysical devices, energetic data is often critically-needed information needed. However, one of the long-standing challenges in computational chemistry is achieving chemically-accurate energetics due to the extensive computational requirements.  Dr. Wilson and her research group are developing a family of accurate, efficient, and easily usable quantum mechanical approaches for the transition metals and heavy elements.  Her methods provide a complete set of ab initio composite strategies that can be applied across the periodic table, and providing the field with novel, accessible ways to approach the heavier elements. Such methods are needed for a range of challenges, including characterizing charge transfer states in photochemical processes which are important in applications such as sensors, probes, switches, and organic light-emitting diodes.  The methodology developed is being implemented in computational chemistry packages to enable dissemination to the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the spirit of the great David Hilbert, our project is problem-driven. As he said over one hundred years ago, ''As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long is it alive. [...] It is by the solution of problems that the investigator tests the temper of his steel; he finds new methods and new outlooks, and gains a wider and freer horizon. [...] A mathematical problem should be difficult in order to entice us, yet not completely inaccessible, lest it mock at our efforts.''<br/> <br/>In the case of this project, most of the problems to be considered were posed over sixty years ago by Paul Erdos, the greatest problem poser in history, and are related to the distribution of primes and modular arithmetic. In fact, the energy and momentum of this project will be established by a kickoff conference which will bring together outstanding mathematicians who have done dynamic and useful work on some of his most challenging problems. For many decades, the main problems seemed to be out of reach, but a few years ago Hough and Nielsen proved some breakthrough results. Within the scope of this project, in applying methods of combinatorics and probability theory to solve several major problems that have remained, some new mathematical techniques for their solutions could be derived that might then be applicable to many other problems, including those in number theory. This project has the promise to be impactful in a number of ways within and beyond the discipline. For example, the factorization of integers is of great practical importance in cryptography, and reconstruction problems are likely to be of use in biology (e.g., DNA sequencing). The second shortest path problem is related to a proposed diagnostic test for schizophrenia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Murray and J. von Neumann as a mathematical tool to understand particle physics. Subsequently, it became an independent discipline that has stimulated the development of powerful mathematical theories and bringing valuable insight to physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell phone network design). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary in nature as they arise canonically from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time their study remained closely connected with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently geometric group theory. This project investigates several major open problems inspired by the rich interaction between operator algebras and the aforementioned fields.<br/><br/>This research project explores new horizons in the classification of group von Neumann algebras. The first objective of the project is to advance Connes' rigidity conjecture, a major wide-open problem predicting that ICC property (T) groups are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras (W*-superrigid). The PIs proposed several natural constructions of W*-superrigid property (T) groups based on new developments in geometric group theory and deformation/rigidity theory. The second objective of the project revolves around the study of prime II1 factors. The main focus is to understand the relationship between various manifestations of negative curvature in group theory and primeness aspects of the corresponding group factor. The results arising from this project are expected to reveal significant cross-pollination between, geometric group theory, ergodic theory, random walks, C*-algebras, and von Neumann algebras. The PIs intend to organize a series of workshops aimed at stimulating collaboration between experts in these fields. To promote the career development of graduate students the proposal also involves a student exchange program between the participating institutions aimed at exposing students to different expertise and research environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These benefits occur through interactions of each individual with the flows produced by others and may take the form of energy savings or speed enhancement. Also to be explored are more subtle aspects of flow interactions such as maintaining or holding together a group, preventing collisions, establishing natural formations or patterns of individuals, and communication through motions that spread across the group. The research work will combine mathematical descriptions of the motions of individuals and the surrounding fluid (water or air), laboratory experiments on ""robotic flocks"" of motorized swimmers or flyers, and the analysis of video footage of birds flying in formations. The different approaches will allow for a complete understanding of the fluid-dynamical interactions in a group as well as insights into how animals exploit or modify such mechanisms. The work thus stands to clarify the role of flows in animal groups and in so doing also suggest how such effects can be exploited in applications such as flow energy harvesting and efficient propulsion. Additionally, education and outreach programs will train high school students, university undergraduate and graduate students in STEM research and especially the important role of mathematics in the natural and engineering sciences.<br/><br/>Specifically, physical experiments on mechanical swimmers, flow-locomotor interaction models and simulations, and crowd-sourced biological data will be combined interactively and applied towards understanding formation swimming and flying. Research will start with the detailed interrogation of few-body systems in order to cross-validate all approaches and to understand fundamental mechanisms. Experiments and simulations will inform models based on vortex-body interactions, and comparison against biological measurements will inform behavioral models in the context of formation flight of birds. Many-body systems of in-line arrays will then be studied, with all methods used to understand principles, for example through analogies to conventional states of matter, in which aspects such as group cohesion, crystallization or other patterning, dynamical instabilities, and information transfer will be explored. Biologically-relevant issues including self-organization and collective advantages will also be studied, and structural and dynamical metrics will be established and tested.

In turn, rising temperatures may increase the activity of these microbes, causing more CO2 to be lost to the atmosphere. The so-called positive feedback is a daunting threat to ecosystem sustainability and human society. However, responses of microbes in soils are complex. Different microbial groups may respond differently to temperature increase through changes in growth, composition and physiology. There may also be genetic changes to these microbes, which may profoundly change the impact of microbial activities.  Genetic changes in response to temperature increases have rarely been studied. In addition, soil organic carbon varies substantially in how quickly it can be decomposed by microbes as temperatures increase. Given this level of complexity, it is difficult to achieve accurate predictions of soil response to temperature change. This research will design a unique soil warming experiment to test hypotheses on microbial responses to future environmental changes. Results will add substantially to knowledge on carbon cycling and allow better forecasts of environmental changes. In addition, this project will greatly increase research capacity at an institution serving underrepresented minorities, with strong impacts on their training and retention in STEM fields.<br/><br/>In this project, it is hypothesized that soil warming will cause consistently more CO2 loss to the atmosphere. This is likely driven by greater microbial decomposition of recalcitrant carbon compounds in soil organic matter (SOM), supported by elevated phenolic oxidase activity and greater diversity in fungal laccase genes. To address this hypothesis, a soil warming infrastructure will be established at Tennessee State University (TSU) to collect high frequency data on soil respiration, SOM content and quality, microbial community composition, extracellular enzyme activities, and microbial genomic information for at least two years. It is further hypothesized that thermal adaptation will result in decreased carbon use efficiency (CUE) and accelerated biomass turnover (rB) of microbial communities under warming. To address this hypothesis, the streams of data collected in the experiment will be integrated with a microbial ecosystem model to estimate the temperature sensitivities of CUE and rB. These efforts will improve the mechanistic understanding of soil microbial community response to temperature change. The project results should improve the representation of microbial processes in Earth system models. By developing strong research collaborations with the University of California Irvine (UCI), a leading institution in microbial and ecological sciences, this project will enable underrepresented minorities to participate in learning state-of-the-art modeling skills, and to get hands-on experience in microbial and molecular analytical techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emerging field of plant nanobiotechnology can help to mitigate plant stress and make agriculture more resilient and efficient. Similar to drug delivery in humans, delivering nano-sized agrochemicals to plants will require better understanding of how the nanomaterial's properties influence its uptake into the leaves, and its movement through the leaf and plant. This project will determine how to tune nanomaterial properties to allow them to cross the leaf surface, enter leaf tissues, and co-locate with selected target locations in the leaf. The ability to deliver nanomaterials into plants at the required rate, location, and dose for mitigating crop stresses will lead to a paradigm shift in the way society manages agriculture to sustainably meet the demands of a growing population. The project will train one post-doctoral researcher and two PhD students, and will provide research experiences for six undergraduate researchers. The investigators will build an international community of plant nanobiotechnology researchers and enable students to provide much-needed innovation in agriculture.<br/><br/>This collaborative project converges ideas from several scientific disciplines (polymer- and nano-chemistry, nanotechnology, and plant biology) to elucidate how the properties of engineered nanomaterials affect plant leaf-nanoparticle interactions, nd promote delivery of nanoparticles into the plant vasculature (phloem) and leaf photosynthetic organelles.

The more than 600,000 bridges in the United States have an average age of 42 years and have been subjected to varying levels of deterioration due to mechanical wear and weather conditions, inadequate maintenance, and deficiencies in inspection and evaluation. The cost of inspecting, repairing, and replacing deteriorating highway bridges has been estimated at more than $140 billion. Bridge collapses - including the I-5 Skagit River Bridge in Washington state and the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River, which killed 13 people and injured more than 145 - should serve as strong motivation to ensure that the conditions of bridges are accurately assessed. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technologies present a way to identify and predict early-stage bridge deterioration to enable proactive repair and rehabilitation. However, these technologies in their current state cannot meet the increasing demand for efficient, cost-effective, safe bridge inspection because they rely on manual data collection, which is prone to human error, non-comprehensive, slow, labor-intensive and therefore expensive, and negatively impacts traffic flow. More importantly, manual inspection is dangerous for inspectors because they must work in open traffic and climb high bridge structures. In response to these concerns, this project seeks to integrate NDE technologies into a single system that will allow bridges to be inspected by a team of robots. In addition to increasing the safety of human bridge inspectors, reducing traffic delays, and saving money by reducing manual labor, this system will combine the data collected by each individual NDE robot to build a more accurate and reliable assessment of a bridge's condition.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a novel research framework that will integrate NDE technologies with recent advances in robotics and automation sciences.

Better performance, longer battery life, and smaller environmental footprints - improving energy efficiency will be the key enabler of applications and services that have not been possible in the past. Approximate computing has recently emerged as a promising approach to the energy-efficient computing of intrinsically error-tolerant applications like image processing, where small deviations from the exact results in the underlying computations do not substantially degrade the resulting application-level quality. For such applications, approximate computing can produce ""just good enough"" results to save energy at the cost of only minor or no quality loss.<br/><br/>This project will develop design methodologies for taking advantage of approximate computing in embedded systems, where the contribution of non-computing subsystems (e.g., sensors, actuators, user interfaces, and network interfaces) to energy consumption is at least as significant as that of computing subsystems (e.g., microcontrollers and memory). In embedded systems, both computing and non-computing subsystems must be holistically considered to take full advantage of approximate computing and accomplish full-system energy quality and scalability.

Often, the locations of certain components in the film must be carefully controlled. This has traditionally been achieved with expensive multi-step fabrication processes. Recent mathematical models of nanoparticle film formation have identified a means to create complex, vertically-structured coatings in a single step, a process referred to as stratification. This process has the potential to decrease production time and costs of multifunctional nanoparticle films. However, there are few experimental studies of the stratification process. In this project, a new experimental technique that involves scanning through the film with a narrowly-focused X-ray beam will be performed during the stratification process. These experiments will follow motion of particles throughout the film formation process, and will ultimately provide information on how stratification depends on the nanoparticle concentration, nanoparticle size, evaporation rate, and other processing parameters. The research will help improve manufacturing processes for multicomponent films used in applications that will benefit human welfare and health, such as inorganic-polymer films for next-generation batteries, drug-loaded coatings for medical implants, and mold-resistant paints for humid environments. Impacts related to STEM workforce development include training of a graduate student and undergraduate students in novel experimental techniques for colloidal materials. The investigator will also aim to recruit students from underrepresented populations for the research. Finally, concepts from the research will be incorporated into new curriculum materials and video lectures on fluid mechanics for high school audiences. <br/><br/>Recent research has identified a means to create vertically-structured coatings in a single step during stratification. Theoretical descriptions of binary colloidal mixtures show a variety of stratification regimes as the volume fraction and Peclet number of small and large particles are varied. However, comprehensive comparison of model predictions with experiments has not yet been achieved because of difficulties in (i) quantifying the vertical concentration profile of particles in the film, and (ii) following motion of particles during the film formation process. This project will use small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with a narrowly-focused beam, performed at varying vertical positions in the film, to fully explore the complex stratification behavior predicted by recent models. The objectives of the work are to: (1) create an experimental process diagram of stratification behavior as a function of particle volume fraction and Peclet number; (2) conduct the first measurements of stratification during film formation by performing time-resolved microbeam SAXS; (3) conduct X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) studies to yield knowledge of how particle diffusivity and dynamics vary during film formation; and (4) integrate research into new curricular materials and video lectures on fluid mechanics for high school audiences. The work will provide the first in situ measurements of particle concentration during film formation in multicomponent systems and the first direct experimental test of recent stratification models in both final dried films and during the film formation process. The project will also help establish new advanced scattering techniques for characterization of colloidal materials. Finally, the data and insight gained will aid in driving improvements to theoretical descriptions of stratification. The research will broadly impact development of single-step processes to create multicomponent films with complex concentration profiles, decreasing production time and costs of multifunctional films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is an outstanding opportunity to reduce this cost by replacing current incandescent and fluorescent lighting with white light emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the color quality and efficiency must be improved further. These LED-based light bulbs produce white light by using a luminescent powder called a phosphor, coating on top of a near-ultraviolet (UV) or blue-emitting LED chip. The phosphor is a key component in these devices because it is critical for the overall efficiency and color of these bulbs; unfortunately, there are only a few viable phosphors available for this application today. Therefore, it is prudent to discover new phosphor systems to fully realize the conversion to new efficient lighting. The researchers are addressing this challenge by developing computational and data-driven methods to predict the properties of phosphors. This approach allows the directed discovery of new phosphors with enhanced optical response. This grant also supports extensive scientific education including sponsoring numerous research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. These students, mostly from underrepresented groups, are learning how to synthesize and characterize phosphors as well as the importance of this energy-efficient technology. The graduate students supported by this work are trained to pursue opportunities in the optoelectronics industry and also across the technology sector where materials science play a crucial role. Finally, the computational products of this research are disseminated through open-source platforms, so all researchers benefit from the scientific developments.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Replacing a traditional light bulb with an energy-efficient, phosphor converted-light emitting diode is one of the easiest ways to decrease electricity consumption. This goal requires the discovery of new phosphor systems, which convert the nearly monochromatic LED light into a broad spectrum white light, to fully make use of this technology. The phosphors investigated in this project are based on wide band gap materials (hosts) that contain a small amount of activator (rare-earth element). Depending on the host:activator combination, colors across the visible spectrum are obtained. The central hypothesis driving this research is that the quantum efficiency and thermal quenching resistance of a phosphor are related to the local coordination environment of the activator ion. This research employs advanced first-principles calculations, local structure analysis using X-ray and neutron scattering, and data science to establish a quantitative understanding of this relationship. Modeling these properties using computational tools and confirming the predictions through materials synthesis and characterization produces a feedback loop where our research results are improved with each discovery. The outcome is a series of design rules that will lead to the discovery of new phosphors with superior optical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Milky Way Galaxy likely contains between ten million and a billion stellar-mass black holes: those with masses a few times larger than the Sun.  Estimating this number and the true distribution of black hole masses can provide important constraints on how black holes form, the existence of primordial black holes from the early universe, and the interpretation of recent gravitational wave detections of merging black hole pairs. To date, no isolated stellar-mass black holes have been definitively detected and only a few dozen black holes have measured masses -- all in binaries.  Microlensing, an effect of general relativity where a black hole's gravity lenses the light of a background star observed from Earth, provides a method to detect isolated black holes and measure their masses.  A research team at the University of California-Berkeley will carry out sensitive observations of microlensing events to measure both the magnified brightness and the shifted astrometric position, allowing them to precisely measure the mass of the lensing object and determine if it is indeed a black hole or simply a chance lensing event between two normal stars.  The outcome is expected to be the first unambiguous detection of an isolated black hole in the Milky Way.  As part of the project, the principal investigator (PI) will also enhance the training and diversity of the next generation of scientists and engineers by improving the training for the teachers who will educate them. The PI will start a U. C. Berkeley chapter of the Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators, which provides a professional development program that enables junior researchers to receive training in inquiry-based teaching methods and education pedagogy.  New inquiry activities developed as a result will be also freely disseminated to a broad community of astronomers to multiply the impact of the program.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new high-precision astrometry experiment to observe long-duration microlensing events and detect and measure the masses of isolated black holes for the first time.  Using astrometric observations obtained from the adaptive optics system on the W. M. Keck Observatory, a sample of approximately seven long-duration microlensing events (i.e. candidate black holes) will be monitored in order to measure their lens masses. The expected accuracy on the lens mass is ~10% for a ten solar mass black hole and the predicted black hole detection rate is ~50%. The resulting black hole detection frequency and masses from the proposed survey will be used to constrain the total number of black holes in the Galaxy, their binary fraction, and kick velocities. Finding these isolated black holes would reduce the orders of magnitude uncertainty on the total number of black holes in the Galaxy and constrain theories of black hole formation and evolution. The proposed development of astrometry techniques, needed for astrometric microlensing, will also lay a foundation for new explorations in many areas of astrophysics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A single flood or drought event can cause problems, yet the devastation wrought by a series of back-to-back floods or dramatic swings between drought and flood conditions can be much worse. California, for example, is all too familiar with dangerous mudslides triggered by flash flooding on top of burn scars left over from prior drought conditions. The central U.S. is also no stranger to back-to-back expansive flooding episodes that drive destructive surges down the major rivers. These grouped events seriously test our ability to manage flood and drought and ensure protection of lives and property. Scientists do not fully understand the weather conditions that cause these grouped events. Nor do they know how good we are at forecasting them 2 weeks to 2 months in advance. Experts from insurance, reservoir design and emergency responders will gather with scientists to identify how these grouped events cause problems. This knowledge will then be used to craft the research necessary to support solutions. New scientific discoveries are anticipated about what causes floods and droughts to group together across the U.S. This new knowledge will then be used to develop ways to forecasts these grouped events 2 weeks to 2 months in advance. These new forecasting approaches will support our ability to prepare and reduce impacts. Through supporting enhanced protection of lives and livelihoods this project ultimately strengthens our national welfare and economic competitiveness. In addition to new science and better forecasts the project has a number of other potential benefits. The integration of research and education is central to the project, and will be achieved through the training and career development of the project team and one graduate student. The project is also committed to diversity and inclusion. Participation of underrepresented groups will be broadened through the mentoring of students underrepresented in science each summer. To promote additional scientific research the project will adhere to, and promote, best practices in open, accessible and reproducible science. The project will also engage non-scientists through a series of media interviews, newspaper/TV appearances, and science writing regarding the special risks to humans and environment posed by connected floods and droughts, and strategies to reduce their impacts. <br/><br/>The work is structured around three objectives: 1) Identify potentially connective regimes and formulate hypotheses about the underlying shared processes by applying statistical models to observation-based datasets of U.S. extreme wet and dry events; 2) Advance the hypotheses by conducting a targeted suite of multi-scale dynamical model experiments for at least six instances of connected events; 3) Understand shared predictability sources by developing and testing a suite of prototype sub-seasonal to seasonal statistical-dynamical forecast systems. Potential contributions include understanding the shared physical processes connecting extreme wet and dry events, demonstrating extended forecast capacity for wet and dry extremes using forecast systems that emphasize connecting processes, and transforming how scientists conceptualize extreme events. Key project outcomes include a physical-process based definition of connected extremes, and a novel generalized research framework that co-advances shared-process understanding and forecast capacity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prototypical example is the spacetime which unifies the three dimensions of physical space and the one dimension of time into a four-dimensional system such that where and when events occur can be studied in clean and effective framework of mathematics. It is indicated by Einstein's general relativity theory that, as a source of gravitation, the spacetime is not flat. How the spacetime is curved can be precisely determined by a system of curvature equations, namely, the Einstein equations. Broadly speaking, this project centers on the relationship between the curvature of a space and the geometry on it. The latter, geometry in our context, consists of both local and global aspects. The local geometry refers to the concrete and rigid shape of a space at small scales, while the global geometry or topology focuses on the profiles at large scales which are invariant under continuous transformations. It is a fundamental principle that geometric complications of a space always correspond to the analytic singularity behaviors of the solution to the Einstein equation. The central part of this project is dedicated to the development of new tools and techniques in understanding the Einstein equation, which reflects substantially new geometric structures of the underlying space. In addition to pursuing open and fundamental problems at the forefront in differential geometry, this project also contributes to establishing correspondence between the new developed geometric structures and the conjectural principles in physical disciplines such as quantum field theory and string theory. <br/><br/>This project is concerned with a family of Einstein manifolds collapsing to a lower dimensional metric space. Together with Aaron Naber, the PI obtained a new flavor of regularity and structure theorem for collapsing Einstein spaces. The PI will continue this project to explore the structure of the singular sets and classifying bubbles for collapsing spaces. Besides studying general collapsing theory, joint with Song Sun, the PI will construct a large variety of new collapsed Einstein spaces in any dimension, which will predict new phenomena especially for higher dimensional geometries. In higher dimensions, the wild geometric nature of the limiting singular set and the lack of effective regularity theory would constitute essential difficulties in analysis and in the construction procedure. The new tools and techniques in the construction are expected more interesting than the problem itself, which will generate many problems and new directions to study. In another line of investigation, the PI will address issues involving collapsing Einstein 4-manifolds with Kaehler structures. Joint with Gao Chen and Jeff Viaclovsky, the PI will address issues involving elliptic K3 surfaces. The first part of this direction would study the metric characterizations of K3 surfaces with generic elliptic fibrations. Specifically, the PI and his collaborators will geometrically identify the bubbles and quantitatively describe the metric behaviors in each class of elliptic K3 surfaces, which would essentially connect the geometric collapsing and algebraic degeneration in an effective way. In the second part, with Hans-Joachim Hein, Song Sun and Jeff Viaclovsky, the PI have managed to construct a family of collapsed Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces which collapse to a closed interval, which in effect gives a metric-geometric description for the Type II complex structures degeneration of polarized K3 surfaces in algebraic geometry. Based on the new metric constructions, the PI and his collaborators will continue this program with a specific goal to understand the boundary structure of the moduli space of the K3 surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subsequently, it became an independent discipline that has stimulated the development of powerful mathematical theories and bringing valuable insight to physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell phone network design). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary in nature as they arise canonically from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time their study remained closely connected with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently geometric group theory. This project investigates several major open problems inspired by the rich interaction between operator algebras and the aforementioned fields.<br/><br/>This research project explores new horizons in the classification of group von Neumann algebras. The first objective of the project is to advance Connes' rigidity conjecture, a major wide-open problem predicting that ICC property (T) groups are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras (W*-superrigid). The PIs proposed several natural constructions of W*-superrigid property (T) groups based on new developments in geometric group theory and deformation/rigidity theory.

The discovery of the so called ""chemical expansion effect"" in selected ceramic materials, in which changes in chemical composition may cause the volume change and, hence, large stress, opened a possibility to elicit an electro-chemo-mechanical (ECM) response using electrical current to control chemical composition. The main challenges towards rationally designing new materials with the desired ECM response has been the inability of current materials to operate reasonably fast at room temperature and the lack of atomic-level understanding of their working mechanisms. The investigators are developing a new concept of an ECM material, based on the metal-ceramic nanocrystalline composites, that they had successfully tested for feasibility. To study the underlying principles of how they work, the researchers are using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a research technique that uses ultrabright X-rays to identify changes in the local atomic environment around metal ions under operating conditions. The project impacts the field of ceramic materials through the development of fundamental understanding and design criteria for this new class of ECM materials. The project fosters international ties between Stony Brook University and Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. The broader impacts of this project are being realized through connections between faculty and students from both institutions, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral scholars in science and engineering disciplines, dissemination of research results to the peer community, and through exploration of materials for new technologies.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The focus of this project is to develop fundamental understanding of processes taken place in ceramic materials during electro-chemo-mechanical (ECM) actuation, an effect recently proposed for developing new generation of micro- and nano-actuators. The ECM effect is the change in mechanical dimensions of a solid as a result of a change in chemical composition induced by an electric field. To formulate the conditions for practical realization of ECM actuation, the complex relationship between the processes of oxidation/reduction, diffusion, phase transformation and generation of macro- and micro-stresses must be understood. As a platform for such investigation, Anatoly Frenkel (Stony Brook University), his international collaborator Igor Lubomirsky (Weizmann Institute of Science) and their respective groups are studying an oxygen ion transport-based ECM device using metal-ceramic nanocomposites. Atomic-level synchrotron characterization provides insights into the effects of the reduction, oxidation and strain in real-time operating conditions. This project offers research opportunities and training at advanced national research facilities at the post-graduate, graduate, and undergraduate levels.

This instrumentation will be used to view the aurorae and make new discoveries about how they are created. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and the scientific datasets will be shared with the public.<br/><br/>A significant manifestation of high-latitude electromagnetic energy and particle flows is the terrestrial aurora which involves many acceleration processes affecting electrons and ions. These processes occur in both the magnetosphere and the ionosphere and are a key component of magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling. Radio emissions from the accelerated auroral electron beams, with their complicated temporal and spatial variations, provide a window into the accelerated electron distributions and the processes that produce them. Auroral Medium Frequency Burst (MFB) emissions are especially promising in this regard because they are associated with substorm expansion arcs and exhibit structure on a range of time scales overlapping with those of Alfvenically accelerated suprathermal electron bursts and other phenomena such as flickering aurora. MFB is, however, relatively poorly understood: its source altitudes is not known, and although a mechanism has been proposed that suggests a connection to Alfvenic aurora, it has not been conclusively confirmed by observations. The proposed experiments, which will answer these and other outstanding questions about MFB and auroral radio emissions, are critical steps toward using MFB and its time and frequency structure as a diagnostic of auroral acceleration and nonlinear wave processes, to answer key questions about the temporal and spatial dynamics of these processes in the ionospheric context as well as their relation to larger dynamical processes such as storms and substorms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet with the explosion of online news coverage, Americans now routinely consume information from a wide variety of sources, including many that did not exist a decade ago.  In this new media landscape, citizens encounter information that depicts the Supreme Court as deliberative, unbiased, and apolitical; or they may receive coverage that is very negative, ideologically polarized, and even inaccurate. Because the authority of the Court rests on the public's understanding of its procedures and guiding principles, the coverage that citizens encounter has significant ramifications for the rule of law.  This project provides the first large scale investigation of Supreme Court media coverage across thousands of news outlets and explores the implications when it comes to support for the Court and the rule of law.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main components.  First, the project develops a web application that allows for the automated collection of Supreme Court news coverage from a wide variety of mainstream and non-traditional news sources online, in real time. The project will make text and image data from the application publicly available in a user-friendly format, so that scholars will be able to search and refine coverage based on dates, keywords, and sources, among other features. Second, the project develops a theoretical framework for understanding the most important features of coverage in a new media landscape.  The framework highlights differences in the frames, tone, and complexity of coverage across mainstream and non-traditional outlets, specifically as they apply to Supreme Court news.  The insights are tested by leveraging multiple text analysis tools and applying them to the coverage corpus.  Third, the project explores the effects of both the content of coverage and media fragmentation more generally. The theoretical framework highlights the content and number of choices as two key aspects of the new media landscape. The project highlights how coverage that is simplistic, ideological, and negative in tone may increase the perception of the Court as a political institution, affecting the public's support for the Court and the rule of law.  Using an experimental approach, the theory is tested with a series of novel survey experiments administered to U.S. citizens.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Law and Social Sciences program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research(EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These non-thermal plasmas act through highly reactive molecules that stimulate the combustion process with low energy input. In this project, we will develop and implement a robust and accurate predictive model that can be used to optimize the plasma- assisted ignition of turbulent flows in combustion devices. If successful, the model developed holds enormous potential to reduce combustion-generated emissions and improve thermal cycle efficiency with positive outcomes for energy security and the environment. The project features activities that seek to enhance undergraduate STEM education at UT Austin and are likely to be adopted in high schools (G9-12) throughout the United States upon completion of the project.<br/><br/>Despite the technological promise with regard to improving energy conversion processes, a systematic understanding of the interaction of plasma discharges, coupled plasma and combustion chemical kinetics, and turbulent transport is lacking. Such understanding is required in order to implement plasma-assisted ignition (PAI) in practical devices towards low-emission and high-efficiency energy-conversion technology. The outcome of a PAI event depends on the competition between transport of energy and plasma-generated radicals out of the igniting kernel and accelerating chemical kinetics and heat release. In this project, we will identify the non-dimensional parameters that govern PAI of turbulent reactive mixtures and define regime diagrams by leveraging massively parallel and large-scale simulations. The high-fidelity physical models employed ensure that no closures are invoked. The flow configuration considered in our approach is a canonical homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow whereby the rates of turbulent transport and all other relevant scales may be carefully controlled. Consideration will be given to temporal and spatial scales of plasma discharges, turbulent flow, chemical kinetics, and rates of molecular diffusion of heat and mass. Data from simulations will be analyzed using powerful new mathematical techniques that quantify the competition of chemical reactions and transport locally and instantaneously during transient ignition events. An important aspect of our approach is that simulations will closely mirror PAI experiments in a turbulent combustion vessel conducted in parallel by our collaborators, providing the unique opportunity for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalysts are critical to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, where they are used to reduce energy requirements of chemical processes and to guide the details of precise chemical transformations. Many of the most active catalysts are based on expensive, rare metals. An important area of current research is to find cheap, abundant replacements for the current metal catalysts. Dr. Gregory H. Robinson, Chemistry Department, the University of Georgia, is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division to make and study highly reactive chemical compounds containing abundant elements including silicon and aluminum. The approach uses radical chemistry. Most chemical compounds contain an even number of electrons, while radicals contain an odd number.  This gives the radical compounds the ability to stabilize metals with unusual electrical charges; Specifically, it permits silicon, aluminum, or other abundant elements to mimic the behavior of the rare, expensive metals that are currently used in catalysts.  Chemistry students engaged in this work acquire valuable skills to permit them to enter the technologically sophisticated workforce.  Professor Robinson is committed to presenting chemistry (and science in general) to a broad range of students.  His presentations include visits to troubled high schools to talk to the students about careers in chemistry/science. He is a unique role model for individuals from underrepresented groups and has mentored a number of students who have gone on to positions in academia and industry. <br/><br/>This project utilizes N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and anionic dithiolene radical ligands to form and stabilize unusual main group species. Group 13 element containing dithiolene radicals are obtained from the reactions of lithium dithiolene radicals with XER2 (X=halide, E = group 13 element, R). These combined with NHCs give radicals where the unpaired electron is primarily associated with the main group atom. NHCs together with the dithiolene radical ligands are used to form species containing E-O or E=O bonds (E = main group element, O = oxygen). Reactions of NHC stabilized chlorosilanes and phosphines give S-heterocyclic silylenes and phospheniums, which is then extended to species containing E-E bonds. These compounds are characterized by the usual chemical and physical methods. This project allows the study of the largely unexplored synthetic and structural chemistry of low-oxidation state, earth-abundant chemical elements at the carbene-dithiolene radical interface. The project also contains an outreach/mentoring component that targets a range of students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adoption of biofiltration is hindered by concerns that undesirable microorganisms will be released into the drinking water. Overcoming this concern would help pave the way for wide-scale adoption of this technology. The goal of this project is to develop a novel framework to control the biofilter microbial community. Such control will allow management of biofilter performance. To achieve this goal, the research team will perform laboratory and pilot-scale experiments using state-of-the-art genomic techniques to enrich beneficial microorganisms. The project team includes experts in drinking water treatment, biofiltration, and microbial ecology. The academic and industrial collaboration will help speed the transition of research to full-scale industrial implementation. <br/><br/>Biofilter operation is guided by chemical and microbiological endpoints, yet current biofilter control approaches lack the nuance necessary for managing microbial communities. Considering this lack of control, it is no surprise that there is little to no knowledge of how biofilter microbes contribute to biofilter performance. This knowledge gap coupled with concerns about the seeding of the water distribution system with biofilter microbes has been a major stumbling block for the wide-scale industrial adoption of this technology. To overcome this barrier, this project will develop the novel Eco-Genomic Framework (EGF) for controlling the biofilter microbial community. This project focusses on using the EGF to tailor the biofilter microbial community to enhance post-filtration disinfection efficacy while maintaining biofilter performance. Preliminary EGF research results suggest that microbial disinfection resistance is associated with nitrogen species availability and resultant genetic stress response in biofilter microorganisms. This project will experimentally test EGF predictions 1) to establish a relationship between nitrogen species availability and nitrogen stress response exerted by biofilter microbes, 2) quantitatively link nitrogen stress response and disinfection resistance, and 3) optimize nitrogen species availability in the biofilter to maximize disinfection efficacy while minimizing potential deleterious impacts. These objectives will be accomplished through laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments coupled with state-of-the-art molecular, bioinformatics, and statistical approaches. The outcomes of this project will serve as proof of concept for the utility of the novel EGF for biofilter operation led by academic and industrial researchers with a track record of productive collaboration, thus increasing the likelihood of successful EGF development and industrial deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical aspect of both of these processes is the exchange of material between the surface and deeper parts of the Earth. Magmas formed at subduction zones reflect this transfer of material through distinctive chemistry suggesting surface-derived material in their source region. One salient example of this is the elevated redox state of subduction zone volcanic rocks, as compared to mid-ocean ridge basalts, which is generally thought to arise from the subduction of oxidized surface material. Although the redox state of volcanic rocks can be assessed through more established methods, the redox state of subduction zone plutonic rocks can be more difficult to assess due to slower cooling rates and lack of appropriate mineral assemblages. This work will expand our knowledge of the redox state of arc magmas through development of a detailed understanding of Fe redox state in a ubiquitous mineral in arc magmas, amphibole, and application of this understanding to a suite of subduction zone plutonic rocks. This work will provide a new tool for the community to implement in the study of subduction zone redox. In addition to scientific contributions, this work will support the scientific training of a female post-doctoral scholar and summer undergraduate researcher at Caltech.<br/>	Volcanic rocks erupted in subduction zone settings are generally more oxidized than those from mid-ocean ridges. The cause of elevated magmatic redox state in arc environments is controversial but commonly attributed to one or more of the following: (a) source processes: sub-arc mantle oxidation via melts/fluids carrying oxidized species from the slab; (b) crustal differentiation processes: assimilation and fractionation during storage in the crust; or (c) eruption and shallow level processes: degassing during ascent and eruption. Most studies on in arc rocks focus on volcanic rocks, which may have experienced some or all of the above processes. Consequently, volcanic rocks are difficult geological records from which to untangle the effects of various oxidizing mechanisms. To understand the processes responsible for the oxidized nature of arc magmas, this research focuses on temporally and genetically related arc plutonic rocks from different crustal depths using Fe valence state in amphibole. The research objectives are three-fold: (1) synthesis of amphibole grains under varying oxygen fugacities using high-pressure and temperature piston-cylinder experiments; (2) development of a new workflow to quantify both Fe valence state and accommodation mechanism of ferric iron in amphibole via in-situ, high-resolution synchrotron M?ssbauer spectroscopy (SMS); and (3) application of the results of part 1 and 2 to igneous rocks from different crustal depths in the accreted Talkeetna arc (Alaska). Although Fe speciation in amphibole has been characterized previously, primarily through bulk techniques (e.g., wet chemistry), SMS affords high spatial resolution and precision which is critical in determining amphibole Fe speciation at the sub-grain scale, as these minerals are often spatially zoned, can exhibit sub-solidus alteration along rims and fractures, and contain inclusions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in climate cause communities to adapt to enhance resiliency and foster practices that are more appropriate for new conditions. In regions where dry seasons are increasingly long, the shorter rainy seasons experience more severe storms. Rural and agricultural communities are especially vulnerable to new seasonal conditions and their resources for adaptation are limited. The Dry Corridor of Central America (spanning parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) is an important region for agriculture and needs adaptation strategies. The project location is ideal because of its many-decades history of changing climate. Regions of the western United States are also becoming more arid and experience more extreme rainfall events. Effective adaptation and resiliency strategies incorporate combinations of technological and societal changes. The collaborative model in this study consists of experts in hydrology and watershed studies, ethnography and participatory research, agriculture, and community outreach. Researchers and professionals from Michigan Technological University, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), and Lutheran World Relief (LWR), a US-based international relief organization that is starting a multiyear project to strengthen communities for disaster mitigation, provide needed expertise to achieve project objectives. The project team and student participants are incorporating hydrometeorological data into forecasting tools to provide data-driven recommendations for rural agricultural communities so they are more resilient to water scarcity and flooding. Students learn new collaborative research methods in an international context to enhance their capabilities for working in socially and culturally diverse settings to address complex problems in land-use management in a changing climate and challenging landscapes.<br/><br/>Students work with mentors/experts in social and hydrological sciences research and education in agricultural communities in the Dry Corridor of El Salvador. The project participants work with local farmers and agricultural stakeholders to gain experience in adapting to climate change. The interdisciplinary scientists and development professionals work together in participatory research in communities experiencing water scarcity and extreme rainfall events. Students collect hydrometeorological and community data to use in computational tools to understand and forecast the hydrological system in steep-sloped, semi-arid area subject to changing land-use. The increased hydrological understanding along with participatory, community-based research better informs decision-makers about more appropriate agricultural and water management practices in response to observed changes in the regional climate. The research team measures the effectiveness of these strategies on crop yields, water usage, and impacts of precipitation-related hazards. The research aims to inform farmers and other local stakeholders about hydrological factors that influence crop yields in areas with highly variable weather and climate. The research will influence decisions regarding crop selection, planting practices, and irrigation. Each year a new diverse cohort of ten US graduate students with different, but complementary, disciplinary backgrounds work together on issues related to these hazards.

The problems with direct measurement largely stem from the vast scales of space and time that are of interest in understanding global circulation.  One tool for estimating global circulation patterns that holds promise is seen in neodymium isotopes which appear to be powerful tracers of deep ocean circulation, over a variety of timescales.  Unfortunately, the elemental behavior of neodymium contrasts the isotopic behavior of neodymium in the oceans, a puzzle branded the ""neodymium paradox.""  This inconsistency of geochemical behavior opens to question the application of neodymium isotopes as a tracer of circulation.  Therefore, scientists from Oregon State University, Tulane University, and Bigelow Laboratory of Ocean Sciences propose to test the hypothesis that there is a yet unconstrained (even poorly identified) source of neodymium to the oceans that can explain the discrepancies seen between the elemental and isotopic neodymium marine budgets.  The scientists further seek to understand the mechanistic cause of this source and thus be able to start making global constraints on its influence.  Understanding these processes will fundamentally change our interpretations of neodymium data and allow us to more accurately quantify ocean circulation with a greater degree of confidence.  For outreach activities, the scientists plan to participate in open house days held at Oregon State University, da Vinci days, National Ocean Science Bowls, Salmon Bowl and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences' Cafe Scientifique.  Undergraduate students and one graduate student from Tulane University would be supported and trained as part of this project.  <br/><br/>Scientists from Oregon State University, Tulane University, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences propose to test the hypothesis that there is a benthic source of neodymium (Nd) to the oceans that exerts a primary control over the distribution of this element and its isotopes (eNd) in the ocean.  This benthic flux results from early diagenetic reactions that release rare earth elements (REEs) from the solid phase to pore fluid.  The scientists contend this flux will explain eNd distributions throughout the modern and past global oceans. The planned research will be guided by three questions:<br/>(1) What are the mechanisms that control the magnitude and isotope composition of the benthic flux?<br/>(2) What are the relationships among bottom water, pore fluid, and the terminal solid phase compositions? Particularly, how and under what chemical conditions does an eNd signature become part of a preserved archival record of [Nd] and eNd?<br/>(3) Can our understanding of the deep water benthic fluxes account for the integrated bottom water eNd as a function of apparent water mass age and circulation path (e.g., how do the pore fluid and solid phase values reconcile with the existing water column signature and water mass age data)?<br/>To test these ideas, sediments and their pore fluids will be collected from a diverse set of deep sea sites in the Pacific Ocean that reflect slow-to-fast sedimentation rates, carbonate-, terrigenous-, volcaniclastic- and siliceous-sediment, and low-to-high organic carbon.  The sediments and porewater samples, as well as samples from the overlying water column will be characterized for the following parameters: major, minor, and trace metals, Nd isotopes, carbonate chemistry, oxygen, nutrients, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, radiocarbon, porosity, and grain size.  With these observations we will build a quantitative numeric geochemical model (e.g., PHREEQC, Geochemist's Workbench, Humic Ion Binding Model) that can capture the cardinal controls over the benthic source.  Our goal is to provide a new interpretive framework for Nd and eNd, such that we can offer quantitative estimates of benthic fluxes for use in models of global circulation.  This work has potentially transformative implications on our understanding and application of REEs and Nd isotope data in both the modern and ancient oceans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While low labor productivity is the cause of poverty and its transmission to future generation, economists know very little about the causes of low labor productivity among the poor.  This research project will combine insights from psychology and economics, sophisticated economic theory, and experimental methods to study the sources and consequences of low labor productivity among the poor.  This experimental research will be carried out in three different settings, thus making the results generalizable.  Each of the three projects will try to answer a specific development question: individual's labor productivity, people's ability to save and smooth out consumption, and total productivity in the economy. The results of this research will provide a better understanding of the sources of low labor productivity among low income people.  In so doing, the results could provide powerful inputs into policies to increase productivity, hence decrease poverty in the U.S. and around the world.  This could also lead to increased labor productivity, faster economic growth, and improved living standards for U.S. citizens.<br/><br/>This research project advances the literatures in development and behavioral economics. The proposal consists of three projects.  Each project links missing markets to distortions in productivity in a low income  setting. The first project tests whether redistributive arrangements, considered a response to missing insurance markets, dampen labor supply and productivity. It will use a field experiment to examine whether enabling workers to convert earnings gains into long run savings, leads to increases in worker output and earnings. This would provide the first evidence for such distortive effects of redistributive pressure in a natural field setting. The second project seeks to provide the first piece of evidence for the role of cognitive constraints on consumption smoothening, helping to explain violations of the permanent income hypothesis. It uses a field experiment to test whether interventions that lower the cognitive costs of planning improve consumption smoothing and output. The third project advances the development literature on both separation failures and factor misallocation by directly testing whether labor rationing is a cause of factor misallocation.  Each of these projects highlight how the presence of missing markets can exacerbate underdevelopment.  By leveraging insights from both economics and psychology, this research will enable work that expands our understanding of the causes and consequences of poverty through new frontiers of inquiry that are not possible through any one discipline alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This arsenic is released from minerals within groundwater aquifers. People that regularly drink toxic levels of dissolved arsenic are at risk of getting deadly diseases. Some rocks and sediments contain enough arsenic to contaminate groundwater under certain conditions. This project aims to understand the conditions under which arsenic is trapped or released. One setting in which great quantities of arsenic is trapped is in riverbank sediments. Rivers continue to flow during dry periods by contributions from groundwater. Groundwater that has lots of iron and arsenic carries huge amounts of these elements to the riverbank sediments. It is important to understand the fate of this trapped arsenic and iron. The goal of this study is to develop a theory on the growth and fate of these iron-arsenic deposits. This project accomplishes this goal by observing which minerals the arsenic is bound to within sediments on the edge of the Meghna River in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has some of the highest naturally occurring levels of arsenic in aquifers in the world. Laboratory experiments will test the impact of tidal fluctuations on the nature of these iron-arsenic deposits. The movement of water and elements will be measured in the field between aquifers and the Meghna River. This project supports the research of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students and prepares the next generation of U.S. and Bangladeshi scientists to understand the movement of toxic elements between aquifers and rivers. <br/><br/>Arsenic-contaminated water resources are prevalent in fluvio-deltaic aquifers whose sediment are the geogenic source. The fate of As in groundwater discharging to rivers, however, remains unknown despite advances in understanding the origin and transport of As in groundwater. A few observations have suggested that As is stored within shallow, permeable, riverbank sediment through sorption on iron-oxide surfaces, referred to herein as Permeable Natural Reactive Barriers (PNRB). These accumulations threaten the communities along rivers should there be a reversal in groundwater flow induced by pumping, or should this high-As sediment be scoured and then re-deposited along a segment of the river where infiltration occurs. In deltaic regions, aquifers are connected to large rivers subject to periodic forcing driven by tides and seasonal flooding. Thus, the dynamics of groundwater-borne As transported to and from rivers should also be driven by similar periodic forcing. The amplitude and period of these fluctuations will uniquely determine the properties of these PNRBs, and knowing this, combined with knowledge of the iron (Fe) and As concentrations of the aquifers, should allow regional prediction of the accumulation of As in riverbank sediment. This project investigates the dynamics of a Fe-oxide PNRB through complementary detailed field characterization of sites along the Meghna River in Bangladesh along with laboratory experimentation and advanced coupled flow and reactive transport simulations. The data-driven modeling is used to assess the occurrence of PNRBs in similar tidal river-aquifer settings through sensitivity analysis. The anticipated findings will advance the understanding of the cycling of geogenic As in shallow, reducing alluvial aquifers connected with rivers in Asia. Critical knowledge on coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for the protection and management of water resources will be provided to both the local communities dealing with As contamination and the broader scientific body. Local stakeholders will be directly involved in the research and project findings will be translated for policy makers to reach affected communities. This study funds the research projects of undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral investigators and expands the infrastructure for studying groundwater-river water exchange along the Meghna River in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ranavirus has triggered localized die-offs of amphibians.  It also has the potential to drive endangered populations to extinction.  Ranavirus infection is a worldwide problem. Thus, a solution requires expertise and collaboration with a wide variety of experts. The 5th International Symposium on Ranaviruses (5th ISR) brings scientists from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia together to share research about ranavirus infections, host susceptibility to infection, immunity against infection, and improved diagnostic tests.  NSF funds will support the participation of early stage investigators.  This will provide an opportunity for US-based junior scientists to share their knowledge and to promote the progress of science (and NSF mission). This helps train the next generation of researchers, which is one of the missions of the NSF.<br/><br/>This award supports travel of junior investigators to the 5th International Symposium on Ranaviruses (5th ISR). This meeting will address multiple issues related to ranaviruses and the diseases they cause.  At the ecological level, the 5th ISR will address how to diagnosis, control, prevent, and (in a limited number of settings) treat ranavirus disease.  At the population level, the meeting will identify potential host species, ascertain the basis for susceptibility, and develop models to better understand (and hopefully predict) the outcome of infection.  Finally, identifying specific elements of the host immune response that correlate with protection from disease, and determining, at the molecular level, the basis for viral virulence, will provide insights into how ranaviruses trigger host die-offs and how the host combats infection.   Collectively, the meeting will bring together ecologists, modelers, immunologists, pathologists, and molecular virologists to address this multi-faceted host-virus system.  Because the problem of ranavirus-mediated disease is worldwide, any attempt at understanding the intricacies of this phenomenon require international collaboration.  This meeting encourages active participation of young investigators. Thus, this NSF award provides an opportunity for early career scientists to establish themselves in the field and to provide their input for future directions in ranavirus research. The strength of the 5th ISR is that it creates genius by bringing together individuals with complementary talents to resolve an issue that each by themselves can only partially address.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ocean thermal expansion (due to increasing ocean temperatures) and mountain glacier ice loss (due to increased glacier melt rates) have contributed most to global mean sea level rise (SLR) and are expected to continue to dominate SLR over at least the coming century. Unfortunately, the uncertainties in recent glacier contributions to SLR and current volume of glacier ice remain high due, in part, to limited data on glacier volume changes. The improved estimates of historical glacier changes and current glacier volume from this project will provide a critical step towards assessing changes in SLR, quantifying glacier sensitivity to environmental variability, and providing accurate projections of future SLR and its associated societal impacts.  This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will also develop educational lab kits for K-12 classrooms. These kits will communicate the results of this research to school teachers and students, while simultaneously providing hands-on, real world, geographical and spatial science exercises.  <br/><br/>The proposed work will quantify regional glacier volume/mass changes over the past approximately 150 years to significantly improve the spatial and temporal estimates of glacier changes and the associated contributions to SLR.  Investigators will include all mountain glaciers and ice caps across the globe in their analysis.  The investigators will also quantify the current spatial distribution of volume of glacier ice using observations from the initial phase of the research to constrain a glacier model.  This will be accomplished using a combination of techniques (automated cloud characterization schemes, NDSI, photogrammetry, photoclinometry) applied to a suite of remotely sensed data and historical imagery to map glacier area and volume changes over the past several decades.  The investigators will use this information to constrain spatially-varying scale factors for a glacier volume-area scaling model. This work will extend back in time to the Little Ice Age (LIA) by compiling reliable moraine dates and maps, and automated mapping of LIA moraines.  The volume of ice around the end of the LIA will be calculated, which will permit placing the spatial and temporal patterns in glacier volume change into context relevant to assess anthropogenic changes. These new glacier volume and volume change estimates will be used to estimate regional patterns of past and future contributions of glaciers to SLR and identify specific regions where glacier changes and contributions to future SLR are likely to be significant. Thus, this research project will focus on glacier contribution to SLR globally and will provide new insights estimating the impacts of SLR in many countries, including the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluid motions in the photosphere provide power for the waves, but the precise excitation mechanism is yet unknown.  Once excited, the wave energy must be transmitted to the corona.  However, recent observations have shown that the interface region between the photosphere and corona (i.e., the chromosphere and transition region) is complex. Thus, it is known how wave energy propagates through the interface region.  These issues hinder the development of coronal heating models, which are limited by our poor understanding of the wave properties at the base of the corona.  To tackle these important science problems for solar physics, this three-year project will use data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) to measure the properties of waves in the interface region of the solar atmosphere.  The main science objectives of the project are to: (1) identify where plasma waves are generated; (2) determine how wave energy propagates from the photosphere to the corona; and, (3) specify the wave boundary conditions at the base of the corona.<br/><br/>During this three-year research project, archival data from IRIS will be analyzed to address the following three major issues.  First, determine where MHD waves are generated.  It is currently unknown whether waves are generated mainly in the photosphere and propagate up through the interface region or whether the waves are generated within the interface region.  The photosphere exhibits various fluid motions that can generate waves, such as the buffeting of magnetic field lines by granular motions.  But, the waves can be reflected by the strong density gradients at the transition region and so not reach the corona.  Global acoustic p-modes at the photosphere could launch acoustic waves, but they must undergo mode conversion if they are the source of the Alfvenic waves observed in the corona.  Alternatively, waves may be generated in the chromosphere, for example, by reconnection.  The IRIS data will be used to determine the wave modes and sources and sinks of wave power through varying heights in the interface region and thereby identify signatures of these processes and other possible ones.  Second, measure the propagation of waves from the photosphere into the corona.  Wave reflection and damping may prevent much of the wave power from reaching the corona.  This project will determine how waves are transmitted through the interface region by observing the propagation of waves along structures and by measuring the power spectrum of the waves.  These measurements will then be compared to existing observations and spectra of lower lying photospheric fluctuations and of Alfvenic waves in the higher lying corona.  The analysis will determine where Alfvenic waves are reflected, if there is conversion of wave power from longitudinal to transverse modes or vice versa, and where wave energy is dissipated.  Results will be compared to theories for the propagation, reflection, and damping of waves throughout this complex region.  Third and final, characterize the wave modes and power at the base of the corona in order provide the critical boundary conditions needed for models of coronal heating.  By comparing the amplitudes and phases of velocity and intensity fluctuations one can constrain the relative contribution of compressible versus incompressible waves.  IRIS has sufficient spatial resolution to see torsional oscillations and thereby estimate the Alfvenic wave energy content of torsional versus kink waves.  By studying the power spectrum of the waves, it will be determined whether the fluctuations are already turbulent at the base of the corona or whether the turbulence develops in the corona at larger heights.<br/><br/>This research project will have broader impacts through postdoctoral training and public outreach.  The project will train a postdoctoral research scientist in the field of solar physics and in techniques for the analysis of spectroscopic observations.

Although they only cover about 15 % of the planet's surface, tropical forests contain two-thirds of live plant biomass and nearly one-third of all soil carbon. Also, these forests exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Changes in carbon cycling in tropical forests, therefore, could substantially alter global atmospheric carbon and, in turn, our planet's future climate. Tropical forests also have very deep soils, yet little is known about carbon cycling of these deeper soils. Temperatures in tropical forests are expected to increase significantly in the next 20 years. Little is known about how tropical forest soil carbon cycling will respond to temperature changes, especially in deeper soils. This research will use a unique soil warming experiment to test hypotheses about how tropical forest soils might respond to future changes. The scientists involved will also use this research to communicate to public audiences the importance of tropical forests for the global environment.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to assess relationships between temperature and biogeochemical cycling in deep soils of a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico. This work takes advantage of the first in situ warming experiment in a tropical forest. Three primary goals of this work are to investigate the mechanisms by which temperature and depth interact in tropical soil to regulate: (1) carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling; (2) soil oxygen availability; and (3) root lifespan, respiration, and depth distribution. This work will provide information critical to improving our ability to predict tropical forest responses to warming and the potential for these responses to feed back onto future climate. Three 12 m2 circular plots will be warmed + 2 to 4 degrees C relative to three control plots, up to 50 centimeters in depth. Each plot will be instrumented throughout the depth profile for soil temperature, moisture, oxygen, soluble carbon, nutrients, greenhouse gas emissions, and root dynamics. The variation in carbon and nutrient availability along the depth profile will be used to test hypotheses about substrate limitation of microbial and root responses to temperature. The soil and root measurements will further illuminate potential controlling mechanisms on deep soil responses to increased temperature. Ultimately, this deep-warming experiment will significantly advance understanding of processes and organisms below the rooting zone, an exciting biogeochemical frontier.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It plays a major role in the presence of life and it is therefore critical to understand how it is generated and can last through time. This project combines experiments and theory to understand if and how the cooling of the metallic core of planets generates a magnetic field and influences the core's evolution. In particular, the project aims to provide a ""revised"" standard model for the origin of the magnetic field in our planet. A novel aspect of this proposal is the constant interactions between experiments and theoretical models. Laboratory-based chemistry will be used to refine the models, and numerical results will then be used to motivate new experiments at specific compositions. The proposed study should improve the current understanding of core crystallization in the Earth and also in other planets such as Mercury and Mars.  This work will be shared with the scientific community and will contribute to the training of students as well as postdoctoral researchers by the PIs both in the US and in the UK.<br/><br/>The standard model describing the origin of the geodynamo posits that the field is maintained by slow cooling of the liquid iron core below a solid mantle and gradual bottom-up freezing of the solid inner core. This model is no longer tenable following the first calculations of the thermal conductivity of iron alloys at core conditions, which predict rapid cooling, a young inner core and pervasive melting of the lower mantle early in Earth's history. In this scenario it is presently unclear how the geodynamo was powered before inner core nucleation. Recent studies have argued that the ancient core could have crystallized from the top down. The central objective of this joint experimental-theoretical project is to understand if and how top-down crystallization generates magnetic fields and influences the thermochemical evolution of Earth's core. This project consists of two major interlinked components:  experiments on core analogues and theoretical models of core evolution. Phase equilibria experiments will be carried out at pressure up to 30 GPa and temperature up to 2200degC in the multi-anvil apparatus at UCSD-SIO using NSF-COMPRES assemblies. The team will consider the Fe-S-Mg(-O) and Fe-S-O(-Si) systems, building on PI's recent experimental work in the Fe-S-O system. Chemical analyses of quenched products will be used to determine the chemistry of phases, the liquidus curve and the eutectic temperature for the investigated systems. Results will be applied to the Earth's pressure and temperature conditions using rigorous thermodynamic extrapolation, as is common in experimental petrology, and will also be directly applicable to small terrestrial planets. Experimental results will be incorporated to theoretical models of the Earth's core and other terrestrial bodies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each Maker challenge engages students in hands-on creation of solutions to authentic problems in a social context, and each challenge is followed by one to three mathematics lessons related to the challenge. Explicit connections to STEM career possibilities are also featured, linking mathematics concept development to potential career interests. Published collections of mathematics MLCs, together with research on their effective use, will enable teachers and schools to incorporate Maker education in targeted ways to promote both learning in mathematics and broader interest among students in STEM related activities and careers. The project will also develop video resources and examples of student work that can be incorporated into teacher professional learning modules for schools and districts implementing MLCs. <br/><br/>This design and development project is guided by the hypothesis that authentic Maker experiences promote deeper engagement with mathematics concepts among ELLs; promote STEM activation in the dimensions of fascination, competency beliefs, and innovation solutions enhance; and enhance teacher perceptions of ELL capacities. Each MLC includes three components: (1) A maker challenge for teams of students to complete in a regular classroom during a single lesson; (2) Two to three follow-up mathematics lessons focusing on conceptual understanding of the mathematics embedded in or exposed by the challenge and students' language, culture, and prior experiences; and (3) Revisiting the Maker challenge to foster connections among Maker mathematics concepts, and language development.

The research plan for this project includes two studies that each explore two research questions.  Study 1 examines the impact of MLCs on opportunities to learn, and the research is guided by two questions: (1) What aspects of mathematics MLCs provide opportunities for English learners to equitably access mathematics learning? And (2) How do MLCs enable participating teachers to recognize capacities in English learners that support engagement in mathematics learning? Study 2 examines the impact of MLCs on STEM learning activation and mathematics learning. The research is guided by two questions: (1) Do features of MLCs impact English learners' growth in the dimensions of STEM learning activation, and their deeper mathematics learning? And (2) Do features of MLCs impact all students' growth in the dimensions of STEM learning activation, and their deeper mathematics learning? An array of standard measures will be used to collect data for these studies, and a background survey will be used to gauge resources and supports for learning available to students in their homes. For data analysis, three analytical models will be used to explore outcomes: (1) How well the MLC experiences influence the dimensions of STEM learning activation, (2) How well MLCs position all students, especially English learners, for future mathematics learning, and (3) Mathematics learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanotechnology is impacting sectors as diverse as medicine, textiles, electronics, and energy. However, concepts in nanotechnology are often complex and teachers are not readily exposed to tools and techniques because of their expense or availability. This RET program will immerse teachers in state-of-the-art university research laboratories to learn nanotechnology concepts and contribute to a research project. The program will help them to develop unique curricula that will be shared with hundreds of students in their classrooms, schools, and districts. The research focus is timely as scientific advances have given engineers greater control over the creation and analysis of materials at the nanoscale using tools like transmission electron microscopes. This program gives educators the experiences, knowledge, and tools needed to communicate the underlying science effectively, allowing them to train a generation of students who better understand nanotechnology and its role in addressing societal grand challenges.<br/><br/>Educators' experiences will be enabled through participation in university research projects as well as tours and usage of nanotechnology core facilities within the Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN) and engagement with companies. The NSF-funded RTNN, which is one of 16 sites in the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, is a collaboration between North Carolina State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Duke University. Participants will be recruited from local school districts and community colleges with high populations of underrepresented students. Teams of 2-3 teachers will be assembled to enable nano-focused curriculum development integrated across multiple grades. Each team will be advised by a faculty research mentor at one of the RTNN institutions. Participants will create and characterize nanoscale materials or devices, connect their work to real-world applications, and gain experience with state-of-the-art research tools and techniques. Currently, most K-12 and community college students have limited access to this field and the resources necessary to support nanotechnology fabrication and development. The first week is dedicated to orientation activities; the following weeks will intertwine project work with curricular development. To cap off the program, educator teams will finalize curricular materials and share their research experiences with fellow RET participants in a symposium. Upon return to their home institutions, educators will implement their curricula and continue to work with open-access user facilities at the participating universities. Through dissemination efforts, this program has the potential to impact thousands of students, many of whom are minorities from low wealth communities, and to encourage their pursuit of STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cancer is still the second leading cause of death in the United States.  Currently accomplished only by significant investment in new equipment, successful therapy hinges upon the ability to delineate and adapt to a precise tumor location ""on the day of"" radiation delivery. Community Centers cannot afford to replace existing machines with more accurate and expensive modalities.  Especially in rural communities with limited resources, few people diagnosed with cancer can afford to travel and incur the cost of staying 4-6 weeks in a local hotel to receive daily treatments from state of the art technologies located only in the wealthy institutions.  Using a novel cloud-based architecture and proprietary software, this Phase II award will allow remote clinics, and any hospital, to treat patients with highly improved real-time accuracy. By enabling their existing radiotherapy machines to deliver an adaptive dose to the current location of the tumor, radiation oncologists can significantly improve treatment efficacy, a patient's quality of life, reduce patient re-hospitalizations, and reduce the cost of therapy.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the unmet need to see daily changes in anatomy throughout the course of cancer radiation treatment and effectively target only the tumor. Today, a physician designs a treatment plan and dose prescription based on images that are captured days or even weeks prior to initiation of radiation therapy, creating a margin of error around the tumor that encompasses healthy tissues.  Unaccounted anatomical changes are quite frequent, leading to a diminished quality of treatment delivery, inferior outcomes, and a decreased quality of life. The phase I project investigated and developed a treatment-equipment agnostic approach to adapt the treatment to account for these anatomical changes. Phase II will focus on integrating artificial intelligence and deep neural analytics to predict two critical parameters for the treatment adaptivity: (a) treatment prognostics and (b) registration error quantification. Leveraging the company's cloud based, scalable, GPU computational framework, the project will develop and integrate patient-specific biomechanical models to automatically validate results and accurately predict future trends in patient-specific anatomical changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, for the roughly 200,000 young children in the US with a visual or hearing disability, language learning proceeds differently, and there are basic questions about the roles of hearing and seeing in language development for which we have no answers. Discovering answers to these questions is critical for supporting individuals with hearing or vision impairments, and those with language delays or deficits, and also for improving the health and educational outcomes of all children.  Children who are deaf or hard of hearing and do not receive sign language input or assistive technology (e.g., cochlear implants) show large delays in acquiring language skills. When such children learn sign language through normal visual modality, though, they appear to develop normal language abilities.  This suggests that vision can provide a ""path"" to language.  At the same time, other evidence indicates that vision is not strictly necessary for learners with normal hearing, as blind adults have largely normal language. Indeed, these individuals learn color and vision-related words (""see"") similarly to sighted peers.  Neurologically, their 'language' brain areas work quite similarly, whereas 'vision' areas reorganize. Unlike deaf infants who receive cochlear implants or sign language input, individuals who are blind do not generally receive (nor appear to require) additional input to support language. This is despite the fact that, in typical development, visual experiences have been linked to language learning (e.g. seeing where parents are looking or pointing).  This project seeks to provide critical evidence concerning how the brain rewires when infants are born unable to hear or to see, and how early brain development enables language acquisition. This project also has two educational objectives that will increase science knowledge among the lay public and schoolchildren, while building the communication, research, and pedagogical skills of tomorrow's scientists.<br/> <br/>Across five studies, this project will examine the knowledge and processing of language in infants who are blind, deaf/hard of hearing, or typically-developing. Given that infants understand words months before producing them, this work focuses on early word comprehension, particularly on words' sounds and meanings, using behavioral, neural, and observational approaches.  Real-time language processing will be measured by tracking eye movements and brain waves in response to language stimuli. In another studies, word learning will be tracked through the analysis of naturalistic recordings of parent-child interactions. Together, the results of these approaches will provide critical insights into how children learn and grow with the types of language input they receive, as well as how to improve language learning in special populations. The educational component of this project includes a multi-tiered research communication plan, along with a set of after-school enrichment activities for local K-2nd graders.  These activities will focus on teaching students about sensory organs in an engaging, experiential format, with simple demonstrations to facilitate STEM excitement and learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, accurate understanding and forecasting of these systems is important for public safety. Processes responsible for the growth and evolution of a particular class of MCSs, occurring at night, are especially poorly understood. This project examines mechanisms responsible for the evolution of such nocturnal storms using a unique set of data obtained by an instrumented aircraft flying in clouds generated by and trailing behind nocturnal thunderstorms during the 2015 Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field experiment. In particular, the project is assessing how small-scale processes occurring in clouds generate cold air which in turn generates features that act to force new air masses to rise, leading to the development of new thunderstorms that subsequently generate more trailing clouds and rain. The second component of the project examines the properties of clouds generated by thunderstorms occurring in the Tropics. This component was motivated by a problem faced by aviation, namely that aircraft flying at commercial flight altitudes can encounter conditions where there is no noticeable echo on their radar yet encounter large amounts of small ice crystals not detected by the radar; such conditions can be problematic for aircraft engines as evidenced by several engine events over the last 30 years. This project uses data collected by research aircraft flying in such conditions.  The research aircraft were instrumented with probes measuring cloud properties during the 2015 and 2016 High Ice Water Content (HIWC) projects conducted off the coast of Darwin, Australia and French Guiana. The project is examining processes that lead to the development of large numbers of small ice crystals by identifying the environmental conditions under which these small crystals form and grow. In both projects, model simulations are also being used to evaluate the role of specific processes in driving and maintaining thunderstorms (PECAN) and for generating small ice crystals (HIWC). Further, both projects acquired next generation polarimetric radar data coincident with the aircraft cloud observations so that cloud properties retrieved from polarimetric radar data can be validated, meaning that data from polarimetric radar in the future can ultimately be used to extend the limited range duration of the field experiment measurements. <br/><br/>At a more technical level, the PECAN data are being used to evaluate the hypothesis that microphysical cooling processes in developing and mature stratiform regions of MCSs force downdraft circulations that create mesoscale gravity wave features on the stable nocturnal boundary layer (SNBL) that in turn focus, organize and maintain future convective activity. In context of storm kinematics and dynamics as derived from multiple Doppler radar analyses and modeling investigations, the PECAN data are being used to (1) characterize the microphysical and thermodynamic structure of the transition zone, notch and rear anvil regions in formative, mature and dissipative stages of the PECAN elevated nocturnal MCSs; (2) quantify and understand how the horizontal and vertical distribution of latent cooling evolves across MCSs during their lifecycles and contributes to downdrafts and gravity wave features; and (3), determine how gravity wave features on the SNBL give rise to lifting that then drives convection and maintains the organization and long lifetime of nocturnal MCSs. The HIWC data are being used to (1) characterize the microphysical and thermodynamic properties of high IWC regions and contrasting them against properties derived from observations obtained in regions without high IWCs; (2) determine polarimetric radar signatures of high IWC regions and investigate how these signatures differ depending upon the relative prevalence of small ice crystals; (3) develop representations of size distributions and mass-dimensional relationships for high IWC regions as a volume or surface of equally realizable solutions in the appropriate coefficient phase space; and (4) conduct simulations to identify processes responsible for the numerous small ice crystals found above oceanic convective cores, and compare against HIWC observations. The broad impacts are (1) improved understanding so that operational forecasters and nowcasters can better anticipate the evolution of convective phenomena; (2) enhanced education and training opportunities (several graduate students are earning advanced degrees); (3) incorporation of PECAN and HAIC/HIWC data into courses taught and textbooks published by the PIs; (4) advanced scientific understanding of high IWC conditions that have led to about 150 power loss and/or pitot tube failures in commercial aircraft over the last several years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these species live near the surface of the water, where they grow and reproduce using different metabolic strategies that shape their place in the marine food web. For example, biologists have traditionally grouped planktonic microbes into either primary producers (which use photosynthesis to create new organic matter) or heterotrophs (which eat organic matter - such as the bodies - produced by other organisms). However, a large number of species are actually mixotrophic: they ""mix"" these two forms of metabolism by simultaneously conducting photosynthesis and eating smaller cells, including bacteria. Furthermore, many mixotrophs are metabolically flexible: they may rely more or less on each source of metabolism depending on environmental conditions. Because photosynthesis (which takes carbon out of the atmosphere and locks it into organic matter) and heterotrophy (which respires organic matter back into carbon dioxide) control whether or not oceanic food webs act as carbon sinks (having a net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), understanding mixotroph metabolism is critical to predicting the effects of marine plankton on atmospheric carbon. This project advances understanding of mixotroph metabolism by quantifying the extent to which mixotrophs can alter their reliance on photosynthesis over short and long timescales. The project tests how quickly mixotrophs can adapt to both warmer and colder water conditions, and how these adaptations alter their role in the carbon cycle. Researchers - including graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate trainees - will measure the physiological responses of experimentally evolved mixotrophs and use mathematical models to connect these changes to global oceanic carbon cycling. As data are collected, they are shared with the public through outreach seminars, annual open house events, and weekly scientific presentations at the local Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>In order to predict biologically mediated feedbacks in the climate system, we must understand how marine plankton will respond to future ocean conditions. While a number of studies have sought to quantify the potential evolutionary response of phytoplankton, much less is known about the impacts of shifting conditions (e.g., increased temperature) on mixotrophs. What data are available suggest that mixotrophs may modulate a positive climate feedback loop: when warmed, mixotrophs become more heterotrophic, thus reducing their contribution to the biological pump and enhancing local respiration of organic carbon. Warming may also result in reductions in cell size, reducing sinking fluxes and carbon export from the upper ocean. Furthermore, because the predicted increase in oceanic stratification is expected to favor mixotrophs, their metabolic responses may be increasingly significant to understanding the global carbon cycle. The PI of this project is experimentally evolving mixotrophs under a range of temperature conditions in a fully factorial design that also manipulates the availability of light (photosynthesis) and prey (heterotrophy). She quantifies the carbon budget, grazing activity, nutrient content, and grazer palatability of evolved lineages in order to estimate the impact of any observed adaptations on carbon cycling. Specifically, the investigator asks how evolved lineages compare to ancestral lineages in their ability to tolerate altered thermal conditions, and connects differences in fitness to shifts in reliance on photosynthesis versus heterotrophy. Simultaneously, she incorporates a mixotrophy module into a global ocean biogeochemistry model, allowing the quantification of the impact of mixotrophs with either contemporary or evolved physiological traits. This work will provide some of the first known data on mixotroph plastic and evolutionary responses, and allow the scaling of these responses to their potential impacts on upper ocean biogeochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For more than two decades, deviations from the Standard Model three-neutrino expectation have been observed in short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Most commonly, new-physics explanations introduce a single sterile neutrino in addition to the three active flavors, electron, muon, and tau, called a 3+1 model. However, within this model, the anomalies and relevant null results are not self-consistent. Given these discrepancies, if all, or even some, of the signals are due to new physics, then the underlying physics must be more complicated than a 3+1 model. Resolving the situation has become a high priority for the field. Unlike many beyond-Standard-Model searches, this is a case where the parameter space we must probe is relatively well-understood. This coordinated IceCube and IsoDAR program, which is developed as part of this project, will explore this space in depth, and offer new approaches involving all three flavor signatures -- even tau-neutrinos.<br/><br/>This PI has developed two ongoing, unusually-impactful programs. The first is the $100 desktop muon counter, which has been featured in the press. She will continue to improve the design and instructions, and to present the device at conferences, schools, and science festivals. The second is development of a modestly modified IsoDAR cyclotron to produce rare medical isotopes, including Ac-225. <br/><br/>IceCube can uniquely search for sterile-induced matter-effect resonances. As the only on-going experiment with tau-neutrino identification capability, recently demonstrated in a successful astrophysical tau-neutrino candidate search, the group will use IceCube data for the first search for anomaly-related muon-neutrino -> tau-neutrino resonances. They will integrate the results of their searches into global fits that the group has performed for more than a decade.  IsoDAR is transitioning from R&D to construction of equipment. The group plans to calibrate and commission the transformative radio-frequency quadrupole technology that they have developed, establishing that IsoDAR can meet its flux goals. Thus, along with a coordinated physics program, the IceCube+IsoDAR combination offers the junior scientists experience at every stage of particle physics: phenomenology, hardware, software, and analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new program features citizen science activities involving mobile sensors, drones, mapping software, and other technologies associated with environmental science data collection and careers. Four learning modules will be developed that focus on air, noise, and soil pollution, and how factors associated with land use contribute to different types of pollution. Field data will be compared to land cover classifications to examine how pollutants are related to and influenced by natural and built environments. Participants will also use their developing technology skills to communicate their findings to larger audiences using a website, digital stories, videos, and citizen science cafes. In the science cafes, youth will gain leadership skills by guiding their parents or caregivers, siblings, and the community at large in citizen science activities. This project extends the typical pattern of citizen science projects by having participants go beyond joining established citizen science projects to initiating their own projects grounded in issues and affordances of their local communities. If successful, the model from this project has the potential to be broadly adapted to other communities and linked to research of local or regional interest or importance.<br/><br/>This design and development project will directly engage 45 students in grades 8 and 9, with potential for reaching over 300 individuals as participants' families and community members become involved in citizen science cafes. Most project activities will take place at government subsidized housing sites. The program progresses through five elements: curriculum development, instructor preparation, immersive summer sessions, school-year sessions for participating youth, and citizen science cafes. The project will develop four teaching modules: Air Pollution, Noise Pollution, Soil Pollution, and Natural and Built Environments. Students will gain experience with field research methods while learning to collect high-quality data using various sensors and related technologies. They will use the data to answer scientific questions. A mixed methods approach will be employed to examine outcomes related to the research questions: (1) How does participation in community-focuses environmental citizen science impact the development of three aspects of science: performance, competence, and recognition as a scientist?(2) To what extent and how does participation in community-focused environmental citizen science activities move youth towards full participation in the science community? and (3) How do levels of performance, competence, and recognition influence progress towards full participation in the science community? Data sources will include a student science identity survey, a test of relevant knowledge, a student interview protocol, a student observation protocol, student artifact rubrics, and a parent/caregiver interview protocol. Interviews will be conducted with student participants at regular intervals, and with parents/caregivers at the end of program sessions. <br/> <br/>This project will expand the existing ITEST portfolio by addressing important questions relating to community-relevant curricula, linkages of formal and informal education, and examining potential new elements of STEM learning ecosystems, including the use of student-initiated citizen science endeavors and youth-led citizen science cafes.

However, the role of the individual leaflets of the plasma membrane in regulating the disruptive effects of nanomaterials is not known. The plasma membrane is composed of two leaflets: an inner leaflet facing the cell and an outer leaflet facing the outside environment. Red blood cells provide an ideal model to study plasma membrane-nanoparticle interactions due to being one of the few cells for which the lipid composition of both leaflets is known. In addition, disruption of red blood cells by nanomaterials can be easily tracked by the release of hemoglobin, which has a distinct red color. The investigator has recently shown that disruption of red blood cells by nanoparticles is dependent on the lipid composition of the outer leaflet with little to no contribution from the inner leaflet. In this proposal, the investigator will examine how the lipid composition of the outer leaflet regulates nanoparticle-membrane interactions. To this aim, the investigator will study the interactions of a set of engineered nanoparticles with healthy and diseased red blood cells in which the outer leaflet lipid composition is altered. Chronic myeloid leukemia, a form of blood cancer, will be used as the diseased model. This disease does not commonly show symptoms in its early phases but induces changes in the lipid composition of the outer leaflet of red blood cells. Completion of this project provides benefits to society through 1) elucidating the role of the outer leaflet lipids in regulating nanoparticle toxicity, 2) providing information on the toxicity of nanoparticles to red blood cells in healthy vs. leukemic individuals, and 3) the development of a rapid screening assay for chronic myeloid leukemia. This project will involve undergraduate students in research, facilitate hands-on nanotechnology education, and educate the public through demonstrations focused on nanotechnology in a local non-profit.<br/><br/>Nanomaterials, depending on exposure and physicochemical properties, can disrupt the cell plasma membrane. The plasma membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer and the composition of lipids in the outer leaflet (facing the outside environment) is different from the lipids in the inner leaflet (facing the cytoplasm). The investigator 's previous research, using engineered silica nanoparticles and vesicles that mimic each leaflet of the plasma membrane of red blood cells, has shown that the lipid composition of the outer leaflet is the primary regulator of nanoparticle-induced membrane damage. In this project, the investigator  will examine the interactions of engineered nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of healthy and diseased red blood cells in which membrane lipid asymmetry is disrupted, to examine how the lipid composition of the outer leaflet regulates nanoparticle-cell membrane interactions. Chronic myeloid leukemia, a form of blood cancer, will be used as the diseased model. This disease is asymptomatic in its early phases but is known to disrupt the asymmetry of the plasma membrane in red blood cells. In this project, the PI will first investigate how engineered silica nanoparticles bind to, deform, or disrupt healthy vs. leukemic red blood cells. The PI will then characterize the outer leaflet lipid composition of healthy and leukemic red blood cells to elucidate how the outer leaflet lipids regulate nanoparticle-cell membrane interactions. This project is high risk-high payoff. While significant differences are expected in nanoparticle-induced membrane disruption in healthy vs. diseased red blood cells, which have different outer leaflet lipid compositions, there is the risk distinguishing and characterizing these differences is extremely difficult. However, if significant differences are observed, this project could be the stepping-stone for the use of nanoparticles for screening of diseases in which the plasma membrane lipid composition is altered. This is a transformative approach, which can lead to a plethora of novel screening assays in the future. This project will also provide new information concerning the biological behavior of nanomaterials. Successful conclusion of this research will shed light on the role of nanomaterial physicochemical properties which induce damage in the membranes of mammalian cells and characterize differences in nanoparticle-induced toxicity for different cells which are a function of the lipid composition of the outer leaflet of cell membranes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The outcomes of these processes have important implications for the location of economic growth and wealth formation, particularly within the finance sector.  The project seeks to clarify how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector.  Findings will be disseminated via a variety of publications (academic and more general and using open access publishing), the distribution of  tools, code, and datasets developed for this project for gathering, cleaning and analyzing data via open-source tools and data such as GitHub, and through educational activities such as student training and classroom modules. <br/><br/>The contribution of this research is to demonstrate how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector. The research will advance theory and understanding within economic geography by looking specifically at financialization and the ways financial institutions and logics exert power in economic systems within these new spaces of finance.  The project has three specific objectives. The first is to determine the geographies of core cryptocurrency functions by asking: what factors contribute to the geographies of different cryptocurrency operations?  How are locations integrated with downstream operations such as ICOs? These questions will be answered using data-scraping and geolocation methods drawn from geospatial science and digital geographies. The second objective is to assesses how cryptocurrencies' uses and networks contribute to value. This will be addressed by using social network analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural nets from computational sociology and computer science to ask: how do networks of cryptocurrencies differ between use types? How does network interaction contribute to value? The third objective focuses on how cryptocurrencies affect financing and entrepreneurial practices within tech-based startups. The investigator will use interviews to gather data to answer: What are the motivations of investors/entrepreneurs in ICOs? and What additional functions are folded into the financing process?  Together these objectives will fundamentally advance basic knowledge in economic geography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an increasingly competitive global environment, American competitiveness often depends on analyzing the best available data and evidence in ways that are rigorous and actionable. Our military, our farms, our factories, our tech companies, and our governments benefit from analyses that document the effect of past and current programs and provide a credible basis for improving future effectiveness and efficiency. The EITM (Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models) program is designed to help young scholars develop research designs in ways that advance critical scientific knowledge and that make that knowledge more relevant and usable to the private and public sector. EITM pursues these goals by providing opportunities for scholars to better leverage possible intersections between theoretical modeling and empirical inference. For example, today sophisticated methods for examining qualitative data, text, ""big data"", networks and related phenomena are drawing scholars' attention. EITM his attention increases the opportunities for, and headwinds facing, theory-empirical integrations. A new approach to EITM can help scholars increase the credibility and value of the knowledge that they are now producing. <br/><br/>The EITM Summer Institutes offer younger scholars an opportunity to work with senior scholars who are leaders in advancing theoretical and empirical research. The content of Institute activities pertains to the development and expansion of best practices. The substantive focus is on areas where appreciable research integrating theory and methods already exists. Institute activities transcend passive receipt of lecture material. Each institute offers participants multiple dynamic opportunities to receive mentoring and feedback from a wide range of sources. Each institute combines a rigorous curriculum with a wide range of one-to-one mentoring opportunities with leading faculty from across the country. EITM is committed to making these opportunities available to people from all backgrounds. We have worked with other groups to deal with the fact that aspiring members of historically underrepresented populations often desire the benefits of an EITM experience, but lack confidence that their institutions have adequately prepared them. EITM's expanded Scholarship program gives us the ability to be proactive in building new opportunity pipelines for such individuals. In short, EITM emphasizes addressing important substantive and methodological problems with a combination of clearly-stated premises, logically coherent theory explaining relations among concepts named in the premises, and a logically coherent empirical work developed to evaluate the premises and/or the relations. Society benefits when its members can develop, articulate, and apply logically-coherent and empirically robust explanations of critical social phenomena. Dealing with such questions directly, as EITM does, is a means to new levels of accuracy and reliability for the growing range of private and public sector entities that use social science to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. Developing a generation of scholars who are up to helping the nation effectively confront its most significant challenges and to make the most of its evolving opportunities is the main goal of the EITM approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The evolution and expansion of grassland biomes 20-30 million years ago was due to an increase in aridity; therefore, grass evolution, physiology and ecology are inextricably linked to the acquisition, use and movement of water. Research into the evolution of the C4 photosynthetic pathway from the C3 photosynthetic pathway has forged collaborations across evolutionary biologists, physiologists, paleo-ecologists and plant geneticists who are attempting to engineer C4 photosynthesis into rice, yet comparatively little of this research has been focused on the hydraulic side of C4 evolution. The aim of this research is for a better understanding of how grass leaf anatomy, in concert with the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, controls water transport through a leaf. This research will provide a better physiological, theoretical and genetic understanding of hydraulic controls and limits in grasses. Targets for improving crop performance will be identified, while adding insight into the importance of leaf hydraulics in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Additionally, new research-related teaching modules will be developed for the University of Pennsylvania's Biology Professional Development Program. The program increases the biology knowledge of high school teachers in the Philadelphia School district, a heavily-underfunded school system. This project will also train a postdoc, a graduate student, and several undergraduates.<br/><br/>C4 grasses evolved from C3 grasses more than 20 times independently over tens of millions of years within the PACMAD clade of grasses. By allowing phylogeny to guide the examination of function, and using a combination of theory and experimentation, the following hypotheses will be addressed in this project: 1. The primary selective pressures for the evolution of C4 changed (e.g. CO2 vs. water availability) depending on when C4 evolved within a lineage, the effects of which are still measurable today. 2. Upon the evolution of C4 within a grass lineage, there was selection for hydraulic reorganization within the leaf, notably a decrease in leaf hydraulic conductance with no decrease in vein density. 3. By examining hydraulic and anatomical differences within a phylogenetic context, insight can be gained on the controls of water flux in the within-xylem (liquid water) and outside-xylem (both liquid and vapor) components of the flux pathway in relation to photosynthetic variation. 4. Genome-level mapping of recombinant inbred lines of a Setaria viridis x S. italica cross will (i) give mechanistic insight into how changes in hydraulic architecture affect water flux through leaves, and (ii) identify targets for crop improvement. An integrative approach using physiological measurements of hydraulic conductance in concert with leaf-water enrichment of heavy stable isotopes will be used in an iterative fashion with fine-scale, physical modeling of water flux through leaves to determine the anatomical controls on leaf hydraulics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The distribution of blood within the cells of a tissue occurs in capillaries, the smallest vessels in the body. The capillary beds usually remain stable, but they can be locally remodeled when there are special needs for oxygen. The process whereby new blood vessels are created from pre-existing ones is called angiogenesis. In humans, angiogenesis happens during would healing, which is beneficial, as well as during the growth of cancerous tumors. In cancer, malignant cells proliferate quickly, which creates local hypoxia (low oxygen concentration). Under hypoxic conditions, cancer cells release growth factors that reach the nearby vessels and trigger angiogenesis. By recruiting new blood vessels, tumors can continue their growth. Tumor-induced angiogenesis is governed by intertwined molecular mechanisms based on the movement of molecules, known as tumor angiogenic factors, within the tissue. While the biochemical signaling pathways that regulate angiogenesis have been widely investigated, the role of biophysical cues remains poorly understood. By introducing a unique computational method, this project will study the impact of fluid flow on the transport of tumor angiogenic factors and how the combined diffusion and flow-based movement of these molecules changes angiogenesis.  The impact of this work, which occurs at the interface of engineering and biology, will be seen in applications to tumor drug delivery, understanding tumor metastasis, and even the development of capillaries to supply blood in tissue engineered structures for regenerative medicine.  The research broader impacts will be complemented by outreach and educational activities, including the development of virtual reality animations that simulate blood flow in capillaries that can be shown to younger students to excite them about scientific computing as well as physiology.<br/><br/>This project is designed to develop a novel, phase-field model of angiogenesis that will be coupled with high-fidelity fluid flow theory that accounts for intravascular, transvascular and extravascular flow on a time-evolving capillary network. This will be accomplished through 3 focuses for the simulations.  First, the role of soluble as compared to matrix-bound VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) will be explored to explain the contradictory experimental evidence regarding the relationship between VEGF transport and capillary development.  Second, in vivo-like interstitial flow will be modeled to elucidate the mechanisms involved with two-way coupled dynamics of angiogenesis and interstitial flow.  Finally, the effect of in vivo-like interstitial flow on tumor angiogenesis will be modeled and compared to previously determined experimental results.  The scientific work will be accompanied by the introduction of biofluid modules into a mechanical engineering undergraduate course in fluid mechanics as well as the integration of undergraduate students into the computational modeling research. In addition to particpating directly in the research, the undergrads will be involved with developing 3D virtual reality simulations using Oculus Rift(TM).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this effectively, cities must use a systemic approach that integrates perspectives of science, engineering, design, planning, and policy, while incorporating input from citizens along the water's edge. The ""Future Cities, Livable Futures: Toward a Sustainable Model for Urban-Watershed Systems"" workshop will be held at the University of Texas at Arlington in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex on August 16 and 17, 2019, to discuss approaches to these complex problems. Participants will have an opportunity to discuss and evaluate the environmental impacts from transportation and related infrastructure systems, climate change, and economic and population growth on the Trinity River Watershed from a variety of disciplinary perspectives to examine the complexities of urban-watershed systems. The future of the Trinity River Watershed will be re-envisioned as a relevant model for future urban watershed management and planning across the United States. The workshop will provide a great platform to introduce cross-disciplinary dialogues around urban-watershed management, explore best practices, and explain and better understand the different factors that interact to form an urban-watershed system. This workshop will result in an interdisciplinary research partnership targeted at developing a research initiative on the creation and stewardship of sustainable urban watershed systems.<br/><br/>This workshop will incorporate a unique participatory approach with design and systems thinking to explore the needs of different stakeholders and the concrete constraints that hydrological and human-made systems impose on urban watersheds, while also examining the manner in which these needs and constraints reinforce social inequity and economic disparity. This approach will begin with cross-sector presentations on best practices and lead to a hands-on re-imagination of the future of the Trinity River Watershed system. With inputs from participants, the principal investigators will identify activities and research areas that will engage stakeholders and collaborators in future endeavors with positive impacts on future urban watershed development in the DFW region and other cities in the United States. Systems sciences will be applied to decipher how different social, environmental, and economic factors, patterns, and behaviors of the urban watershed interact to form a complex system. Network analysis will also be used for the study of the urban watershed as a dynamic system in order to simulate the heterogeneous factors that interact and constitute urban-watershed relationships. Based on the information gathered from the conference, the workshop leaders will better understand the interactions among environmental, social, and economic variables within a dynamic system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The best current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive, have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method is much less expensive and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate, providing jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our domestic oil reserves.  Full success of enhanced oil recovery,could produce up to 21.7 billion barrels of additional oil generating over $1 trillion for the US oil industry over the next twenty-five years, thereby increasing the energy security of the U.S. and creating more jobs while stabilizing domestic oil production at much lower costs than other technologies. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to validate the technology to optimize wettability in existing oil reservoirs through flotation experiments, computer modeling and field pilots.  Once we have achieved good pH control during the flotation experiments, we will determine the impact on reservoir wettability, the effect of salinity on wettability and the equilibrium constants for the surface complexation computer model.  Finally, we will conduct concept validation projects in field to verify a minimum of 5% OOIP increase in oil production. Thus, we will provide producers with a field-verified process operators can implement to yield significant results for little cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each Maker challenge engages students in hands-on creation of solutions to authentic problems in a social context, and each challenge is followed by one to three mathematics lessons related to the challenge. Explicit connections to STEM career possibilities are also featured, linking mathematics concept development to potential career interests. Published collections of mathematics MLCs, together with research on their effective use, will enable teachers and schools to incorporate Maker education in targeted ways to promote both learning in mathematics and broader interest among students in STEM related activities and careers. The project will also develop video resources and examples of student work that can be incorporated into teacher professional learning modules for schools and districts implementing MLCs. <br/><br/>This design and development project is guided by the hypothesis that authentic Maker experiences promote deeper engagement with mathematics concepts among ELLs; promote STEM activation in the dimensions of fascination, competency beliefs, and innovation solutions enhance; and enhance teacher perceptions of ELL capacities. Each MLC includes three components: (1) A maker challenge for teams of students to complete in a regular classroom during a single lesson; (2) Two to three follow-up mathematics lessons focusing on conceptual understanding of the mathematics embedded in or exposed by the challenge and students' language, culture, and prior experiences; and (3) Revisiting the Maker challenge to foster connections among Maker mathematics concepts, and language development.

The research plan for this project includes two studies that each explore two research questions.  Study 1 examines the impact of MLCs on opportunities to learn, and the research is guided by two questions: (1) What aspects of mathematics MLCs provide opportunities for English learners to equitably access mathematics learning? And (2) How do MLCs enable participating teachers to recognize capacities in English learners that support engagement in mathematics learning? Study 2 examines the impact of MLCs on STEM learning activation and mathematics learning.

And (2) Do features of MLCs impact all students' growth in the dimensions of STEM learning activation, and their deeper mathematics learning? An array of standard measures will be used to collect data for these studies, and a background survey will be used to gauge resources and supports for learning available to students in their homes. For data analysis, three analytical models will be used to explore outcomes: (1) How well the MLC experiences influence the dimensions of STEM learning activation, (2) How well MLCs position all students, especially English learners, for future mathematics learning, and (3) Mathematics learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, ultra-intense lasers will be used to create, control and study plasmas.  Pulses of laser light from modern lasers can be made so focused as to allow the laser fields to push on electrons like a snowplow. In this project, the laser pulses are shaped so that they travel with a tilt, much as a tilted snowplow blade scoops up the snow and pushes it to the side.  With careful laser control, the electrons can be separated from the ions and be formed by such a tilted snowplow into a beam. If the range of electron beam angles and energies can be made as small as the calculations predict, and the beam energy as high as the calculations predict, the electron beam can be used to study materials, or be boosted to even higher energies with additional particle acceleration techniques.  The project will support and train one PhD student and two undergraduate students at the Colorado School of Mines.<br/> <br/>This project exploits the structuring of the spatial and temporal shape of intense, ultrafast laser pulses to control electron dynamics in plasmas. One type of structuring that will be used is where the spectral components of the laser pulse are overlapped at the focus with an incident angle that is linearly dependent on the frequency. This results in a pulse that sweeps across the focal plane with a speed that can be much lower than the speed of light. This reduced speed allows the light pressure on the electrons to capture and accelerate them to the side. With careful shaping of the transverse intensity profile, theory predicts electrons can be accelerated with a narrow energy and angular spread, making them useful for ultrafast electron diffraction and injection into other laser-based electron accelerators. In this project, the physics of this acceleration mechanism will be experimentally and computationally explored. At higher density, the fast current pulse created by this mechanism is predicted to produce terahertz radiation that will be characterized with novel single pixel imaging techniques. Another method of structuring the laser light involves converting the polarization state of the laser beam to transverse electric. When this azimuthally polarized beam is focused tightly, the magnetic field develops a longitudinal component on axis that can be over 10 kTesla, orders of magnitude higher than the strongest magnets. A short wavelength probe beam propagating along this field will be used to probe how waves are altered by this strong magnetic field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These risks are often highly localized and therefore avoidable. Many Americans depend on well water that often is below the standards set by regulatory actions pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. One approach to reduce contaminants is to rely on the government to mitigate these risks and reduce the welfare impact of adverse outcomes through the provision of local public goods, including safe drinking water and health services. Government provision of such public goods, however, is not always adequate. The assumptions underlying this project is that such limitations may be overcome by (a) exploiting private risk to achieve greater cooperation, building upon the ""veil of ignorance"" concept of John Rawls to foster cooperation for public goods; (b) departing from the pitfalls of either extreme of public or private goods only by focusing on sharing of privately-owned resources; and (c) exploring how information and social-networks increase cooperation as well as encouraging private investments in mitigation technologies. To test these concepts, the researchers have chosen as context a major disaster of natural origin: toxic levels of arsenic in groundwater pumped by millions of private wells across Bangladesh. Information on individual risk, in this case well tests for arsenic, are provided in ways that encourage greater cooperation and investment through the sharing of safe wells and the installation of new safe wells. The findings have implications for environmental policy in the United States as high-resolution data on water, air, and soil quality become increasingly accessible to citizens. <br/><br/>More specifically, this research studies the role of risk-sharing and social networks in perception and mitigation of local environmental risks. The research team focuses on two aspects: increasing cooperation for risk mitigation and increasing private investment in risk mitigation technology. This project is based in a setting where these two factors become particularly important due to a lack of government-provided resources for reducing environmental risk. The research first tests whether informal insurance, where compliance may be primarily enforced by existing social structure and reciprocity norms, can effectively counter the undersupply of local public goods. Then, the team studies how social-networks can help in increasing cooperation, adoption and investment in risk mitigation technology. To understand the channels, this project explores  how information on risk can facilitate more cooperation and risk mitigation. This relatively low-cost approach is different from the current approach of the government of Bangladesh which is focused on expensive infrastructure of limited reach. The study is a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, where the researchers randomly assign interventions on (a) ex-ante risk sharing, (b) information provision on risk, and (c) the demonstration of intermediate-depth wells which yield low arsenic. The original data allow the research team to test the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of mitigation efforts and reduction in arsenic exposure to the population. The experimental design allows for documentation of the causal impact of the interventions. The research team intends to share the results with policy makers and organizations so that lessons learnt here can be applied in similar settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will primarily use a unique dataset of oceanic near-surface hourly currents provided by the trajectories of surface drifting buoys from the Global Drifter Program (GDP). The approach is guided by an analysis of tidal energetics which distinguishes between time-mean, or phase-locked, baroclinic tides and time-variable, or non-phase-locked, baroclinic tides. The GDP dataset is both large enough and sufficiently accurate that it should permit quantitative assessment of both types of baroclinic tides, and specifically test theoretical models for the scattering of phase-locked tides into non-phase-locked tides. In addition, the analyses will permit the mapping---for both phase-locked and non-phase-locked tides---of dissipation rate coefficients and their associated dynamical processes, which can be distinct based on geographical locations and environmental conditions. Such mapping will provide much needed information for improving the realism and physical parameterization of tidal mixing in ocean general circulation models. The work will contribute to the goal of measuring on a global scale upper-ocean currents which ubiquitously exhibit energetic oscillations at tidal frequencies. Improved prediction of ocean surface currents will have societal impacts for stakeholders ranging from the shipping industry to seasonal climate forecasters. The project will also contribute to a climate-themed educational program including summer camps, hands-n activites, and enhancements to existing school field trip programs.<br/><br/>Estimates of the phase-locked tides are presently available from the analysis of satellite altimeter data,and these estimates have led to the creation of baroclinic tide models, which this project will test and extend using the GDP data. As tidal dynamics includes both wave scattering and wave dissipation, testing these models will place constraints on the range of physically plausible parameterizations for these processes on regional and global scales. Finally, the GDP data shall be systematically compared with outputs of a tide and mesoscale-resolving ocean global circulation model, an exercise which will be useful for validating the model simulations as well as providing a useful context for understanding potential biases of the GDP observations and statistical methods applied. This project will generate new knowledge concerning tidal currents in order to better understand tidal dynamics and their role in the maintenance of the global thermohaline ocean circulation. The new drifter dataset that will be utilized to investigate baroclinic tidal phenomena is both large enough and unique (temporally, spatially and accuracy wise) to provide a quantitative description of tidal properties. In addition, qualitative and potentially new assessments of tidal/non-tidal interactions will be obtained, including their seasonal and longer temporal variability. A novel decomposition of the tidal energy budget, which separates processes primarily affecting phase-locked and non-phase-locked tidal signals, is proposed to guide the analysis and interpretation of the drifter observations, as well as altimetry data and numerical simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how such species adapt rapidly to new environments is key to preventing and managing invasions. Traditionally, the focus has been on inherent traits and flexibility of an invasive species, ignoring the potential for evolutionary change after introduction. However, recent research has shown that some marine species may evolve specific genomic features which allow highly efficient selection over as little as a single generation. This project tests the importance of genomic traits in allowing marine invasive species to survive and thrive on new shores. Its focus is on the high-impact invasive European green crab, which has spread over 1,500 km of the West Coast of North America since 1989 and has very recently begun expanding into the Salish Sea. This project tracks the earliest stages of green crab invasion into a new environment where the species is predicted to have substantial ecological and economic impacts. Genetic differences are followed over time and space across the entire West Coast, with a focus on crabs found in the Salish Sea where the species is currently expanding. Genetic data is complemented by oceanographic modeling to predict the spread of green crabs into the Salish Sea and across the West Coast. Finally, targeted sequencing and prior sampling are used to probe the genomic traits underlying these changes and determine if the same traits have played a role in the species' invasive success on other shores. Sampling for this project is conducted by Washington Sea Grant's Crab Team, an expansive outreach and monitoring program powered largely by hundreds of volunteers who monitor green crabs across 3,000 miles of coastline in the Salish Sea. The results of this project are shared with these volunteers and other stakeholders and is used to inform trans-boundary green crab management and spread prediction on the West Coast.<br/><br/>Recent work has hypothesized that genomic architecture, which has been increasingly discovered to play a role in local adaptation, may also be key to a species' ability to adapt quickly when gene flow is high. This project integrates multiple approaches to track the speed and dynamics of adaptation-with-gene flow across a thermal gradient in an explicit oceanographic context using the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas). Prior work in this system identified a suite of genes that appear to constitute balanced polymorphisms whose allele frequencies correlate strongly with site temperature against a homogeneous neutral genetic background. This project has three main goals: 1) To examine fine-scale selection to temperature over a comprehensive spatial and temporal data set comprising most of the species' history on the West Coast, 2) To track the expanding range front in the Salish Sea, comparing the genetic trajectory of individuals at the range edge with oceanographic modeling of dispersal, and 3) To characterize the genomic regions surrounding putative balanced polymorphisms and examine the ubiquity of their association with temperature across globally replicated populations. This coupled evolutionary oceanography approach represents an unprecedented test of the speed and nature of rapid adaptation in a highly dynamic natural marine environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The problems with direct measurement largely stem from the vast scales of space and time that are of interest in understanding global circulation.  One tool for estimating global circulation patterns that holds promise is seen in neodymium isotopes which appear to be powerful tracers of deep ocean circulation, over a variety of timescales.  Unfortunately, the elemental behavior of neodymium contrasts the isotopic behavior of neodymium in the oceans, a puzzle branded the ""neodymium paradox.""  This inconsistency of geochemical behavior opens to question the application of neodymium isotopes as a tracer of circulation.  Therefore, scientists from Oregon State University, Tulane University, and Bigelow Laboratory of Ocean Sciences propose to test the hypothesis that there is a yet unconstrained (even poorly identified) source of neodymium to the oceans that can explain the discrepancies seen between the elemental and isotopic neodymium marine budgets.  The scientists further seek to understand the mechanistic cause of this source and thus be able to start making global constraints on its influence.  Understanding these processes will fundamentally change our interpretations of neodymium data and allow us to more accurately quantify ocean circulation with a greater degree of confidence.  For outreach activities, the scientists plan to participate in open house days held at Oregon State University, da Vinci days, National Ocean Science Bowls, Salmon Bowl and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences' Cafe Scientifique.  Undergraduate students and one graduate student from Tulane University would be supported and trained as part of this project.  <br/><br/>Scientists from Oregon State University, Tulane University, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences propose to test the hypothesis that there is a benthic source of neodymium (Nd) to the oceans that exerts a primary control over the distribution of this element and its isotopes (eNd) in the ocean.  This benthic flux results from early diagenetic reactions that release rare earth elements (REEs) from the solid phase to pore fluid.  The scientists contend this flux will explain eNd distributions throughout the modern and past global oceans. The planned research will be guided by three questions:<br/>(1) What are the mechanisms that control the magnitude and isotope composition of the benthic flux?<br/>(2) What are the relationships among bottom water, pore fluid, and the terminal solid phase compositions? Particularly, how and under what chemical conditions does an eNd signature become part of a preserved archival record of [Nd] and eNd?<br/>(3) Can our understanding of the deep water benthic fluxes account for the integrated bottom water eNd as a function of apparent water mass age and circulation path (e.g., how do the pore fluid and solid phase values reconcile with the existing water column signature and water mass age data)?<br/>To test these ideas, sediments and their pore fluids will be collected from a diverse set of deep sea sites in the Pacific Ocean that reflect slow-to-fast sedimentation rates, carbonate-, terrigenous-, volcaniclastic- and siliceous-sediment, and low-to-high organic carbon.  The sediments and porewater samples, as well as samples from the overlying water column will be characterized for the following parameters: major, minor, and trace metals, Nd isotopes, carbonate chemistry, oxygen, nutrients, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, radiocarbon, porosity, and grain size.  With these observations we will build a quantitative numeric geochemical model (e.g., PHREEQC, Geochemist's Workbench, Humic Ion Binding Model) that can capture the cardinal controls over the benthic source.  Our goal is to provide a new interpretive framework for Nd and eNd, such that we can offer quantitative estimates of benthic fluxes for use in models of global circulation.

Thus, accurate understanding and forecasting of these systems is important for public safety. Processes responsible for the growth and evolution of a particular class of MCSs, occurring at night, are especially poorly understood. This project examines mechanisms responsible for the evolution of such nocturnal storms using a unique set of data obtained by an instrumented aircraft flying in clouds generated by and trailing behind nocturnal thunderstorms during the 2015 Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field experiment. In particular, the project is assessing how small-scale processes occurring in clouds generate cold air which in turn generates features that act to force new air masses to rise, leading to the development of new thunderstorms that subsequently generate more trailing clouds and rain. The second component of the project examines the properties of clouds generated by thunderstorms occurring in the Tropics. This component was motivated by a problem faced by aviation, namely that aircraft flying at commercial flight altitudes can encounter conditions where there is no noticeable echo on their radar yet encounter large amounts of small ice crystals not detected by the radar; such conditions can be problematic for aircraft engines as evidenced by several engine events over the last 30 years. This project uses data collected by research aircraft flying in such conditions.  The research aircraft were instrumented with probes measuring cloud properties during the 2015 and 2016 High Ice Water Content (HIWC) projects conducted off the coast of Darwin, Australia and French Guiana. The project is examining processes that lead to the development of large numbers of small ice crystals by identifying the environmental conditions under which these small crystals form and grow. In both projects, model simulations are also being used to evaluate the role of specific processes in driving and maintaining thunderstorms (PECAN) and for generating small ice crystals (HIWC). Further, both projects acquired next generation polarimetric radar data coincident with the aircraft cloud observations so that cloud properties retrieved from polarimetric radar data can be validated, meaning that data from polarimetric radar in the future can ultimately be used to extend the limited range duration of the field experiment measurements. <br/><br/>At a more technical level, the PECAN data are being used to evaluate the hypothesis that microphysical cooling processes in developing and mature stratiform regions of MCSs force downdraft circulations that create mesoscale gravity wave features on the stable nocturnal boundary layer (SNBL) that in turn focus, organize and maintain future convective activity. In context of storm kinematics and dynamics as derived from multiple Doppler radar analyses and modeling investigations, the PECAN data are being used to (1) characterize the microphysical and thermodynamic structure of the transition zone, notch and rear anvil regions in formative, mature and dissipative stages of the PECAN elevated nocturnal MCSs; (2) quantify and understand how the horizontal and vertical distribution of latent cooling evolves across MCSs during their lifecycles and contributes to downdrafts and gravity wave features; and (3), determine how gravity wave features on the SNBL give rise to lifting that then drives convection and maintains the organization and long lifetime of nocturnal MCSs. The HIWC data are being used to (1) characterize the microphysical and thermodynamic properties of high IWC regions and contrasting them against properties derived from observations obtained in regions without high IWCs; (2) determine polarimetric radar signatures of high IWC regions and investigate how these signatures differ depending upon the relative prevalence of small ice crystals; (3) develop representations of size distributions and mass-dimensional relationships for high IWC regions as a volume or surface of equally realizable solutions in the appropriate coefficient phase space; and (4) conduct simulations to identify processes responsible for the numerous small ice crystals found above oceanic convective cores, and compare against HIWC observations. The broad impacts are (1) improved understanding so that operational forecasters and nowcasters can better anticipate the evolution of convective phenomena; (2) enhanced education and training opportunities (several graduate students are earning advanced degrees); (3) incorporation of PECAN and HAIC/HIWC data into courses taught and textbooks published by the PIs; (4) advanced scientific understanding of high IWC conditions that have led to about 150 power loss and/or pitot tube failures in commercial aircraft over the last several years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cars, trucks, motorcycles, airplanes, ships, and submarines all require a lot of fuel to overcome this drag force and move through air or water. A large part of this resistance is caused by friction effects between the surface and the fluid. These effects are confined in a very thin region near the surface, called the boundary layer. The boundary layer causes no real harm when its motion is very regular and ordered (laminar motion) because the resistive force is very small. However, on large bodies, like airplanes and trucks, the boundary layer is often chaotic because there are a lot of vortices and whirls (turbulent motion), which give a huge resistive force. The change of a boundary layer from laminar to turbulent is called laminar-turbulent transition. The knowledge of this change is essential information for the design of transport vehicles because it is critical to predict how much drag force is generated. This project seeks to study laminar-turbulent transition in air flowing over very fast airplanes. The focus is on the high-speed boundary layers over concave parts of the airplanes, like the bottom of the wing, because these curved surfaces are much more common than flat surfaces. These very fast flows also occur inside the engines, over turbine blades in particular, that compress gases to make the airplanes fly. A systematic theoretical and numerical study will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Sheffield to provide a complete understanding of when, where, and how a high-speed boundary layer flowing over concave solid surfaces transitions to turbulence. Integrated with the research effort, a variety of educational activities will be undertaken to showcase and instill the excitement of cyberphysics discovery in students at all levels, as well as to prepare a highly-trained workforce in high-speed flows and advanced cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>The overall objectives of this CBET-EPSRC proposal are to advance the fundamental understanding of all the stages of laminar-turbulent transition in compressible boundary layers flowing over concave solid surfaces, starting from the entrainment of the free-stream disturbances into a laminar boundary layer (i.e., the receptivity stage) through transition up to a fully turbulent flow. The inclusion of the receptivity stage is a fundamental ingredient for transition prediction that has not been previously explored for subsonic and supersonic boundary-layer flows subject to streamwise concave curvature. The proposed approach includes receptivity analysis based on advanced nonlinear asymptotic theory, boundary-layer instability computations, and direct numerical simulations (DNS). A systematic theoretical and numerical study will be conducted to clarify the role of Gortler vortices, streamwise-elongated, counter-rotating structures caused by concave curvature, the dynamics of which is extremely difficult to predict and control. The detailed study of boundary-layer physics will also be combined with large-eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to assess the performance of subgrid-scale (SGS) and RANS models for transitional flows dominated by Gortler vortices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, genetic variation from Neanderthals exists in the human gene pool, but the effects of this variation on human biology are not well understood. In this doctoral dissertation project, the researcher will conduct a large-scale laboratory-based genetic experiment to test whether Neanderthal variants can affect the degree to which a gene is active in human immune cells. By identifying these variants and making publicly available the raw data from this experiment, the researchers will advance knowledge about the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on the immune system of living humans. Given that science news often features stories about Neanderthals, the researchers will utilize popular interest in this area to demonstrate the biological and medical relevance of studying human evolutionary history. They will also work with two museums to develop an exhibit that will additionally highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will help promote women in science given that the research will largely be undertaken by a female graduate student who is committed to training other women in science and has been active in the organization for Graduate Women in Science Engineering at her university. <br/><br/>Although the last two decades have seen great strides in genetic research, because the specific function of most of the human genome is still unknown, researchers face difficulty when trying to connect most specific genetic mutations to their effect on biology. To aid in this discovery, datasets have been produced that allow correlations between the presence of genetic variation and biological phenotypes. However, because genetic variants near each other are often inherited together, it can be difficult to determine which genetic variant is responsible for the biological effect, limiting the ability to truly understand the mechanism. This is especially true in the case of Neanderthal genetic sequences present in living humans, which mostly lay in poorly understood parts of the genome that are thought generally to regulate the expression of genes. Nonetheless, correlational evidence suggests that this Neanderthal genetic variation may be affecting human immune system function. The researchers will conduct an experiment in which they simultaneously test thousands of Neanderthal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in the immune system, in order to isolate the specific Neanderthal genetic variants that affect the biology of the human immune system. This will allow researchers to focus future work on specific functional testing of these important genetic variants.  Furthermore, by directly comparing correlational findings to the results in a laboratory experiment, this research will deepen the understanding of these commonly used genetic datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the movement of heat and mass in the Earth's crust directly improves the understanding of other crustal systems such as geothermal systems, ore bodies, and geological hazards associated with volcanism. Multiple mineral phases with complementary strengths as geochronometers, together with multiple analytical techniques, will be used to produce a high-fidelity temperature (T)-time (t) record for the Alta-Little Cottonwood stock system, Utah, USA. In-situ microanalytical techniques will be used to place analytical results (mineral ages, chemistry) in textural and spatial context in order to connect these analytical results to the geologic processes responsible for the evolution of this magmatic-metamorphic system. The research outcomes could redefine our understanding of both the magmatic and metamorphic processes in these systems and in turn affect how we best utilize thermal and mineral resources and prepare for volcanic hazards. This project will strengthen research at a primarily undergraduate institution. In addition, a summer-school program will broaden participation in Earth Science and disseminate scientific content to middle school students in the context of the Utah Science Core curriculum. <br/><br/>The project will address fundamental questions of how incremental pluton emplacement and evolving permeability structures govern the temporal and spatial patterns of (hydro-) thermal metamorphism. Preliminary petrochronology results indicate that hydrothermal alteration of the Alta stock (AS), and possibly also growth of the contact aureole, occurred over ~10 Myr. This project will reconcile the small size of the AS with the large areal extent of its contact aureole (AA) and determine whether emplacement of the Little Cottonwood Stock (LCS) instead drove protracted, episodic hydrothermal and contact metamorphism in the adjacent AS and aureole. The researchers will apply in situ (LASS-ICP-MS) and high precision (CA-TIMS) U-Pb dating of titanite, zircon, and garnet in conjunction with thermal modeling to construct a robust T-t history of the system. They will test whether 1) the AS was a conduit for long-lived, episodic hydrothermal fluid-flow driven by emplacement of the LCS; 2) the hydrothermal system driven by emplacement of the LCS merely overprinted the western portion of the AS; or 3) a younger intrusion is responsible for the protracted hydrothermal systems in both stocks. The results of this project will impact our understanding of the transfer, storage, and crystallization of magmas, timescales of ore-body genesis, isotopic dating of major mineral phases, the timescales of contact metamorphic reactions, heat and mass transfer in orogens, and thermal modeling of magma and hydrothermal conduits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike Earth's continents, which may persist for billions of years, the oceanic crust is continually destroyed and created. These dynamic processes lead to the opening and closure of ocean basins, and even the breaking apart of continents. Continental rifts, which manifest as a series of interconnected linear to arcuate valleys on continents, are the manifestation of the process by which continents may split and new oceans form. Insights into the creation of new oceans thus depends on the processes active within continental rifts. This project focuses on the generation of large volumes of lavas within continental rifts. These lavas form the basis of later oceanic crust, but the mechanism of magma generation is currently unclear. The project focuses on the East African rift - the premier example of a modern continental rift, and examines how magmas are generated in the mantle, evolve in the crust, and eventually erupt in this rift. One of the eventual aims of this project is to develop an understanding as to why large-volumes of lavas flood onto the surface of the rift during certain periods, while during other periods the lavas are restricted to linear belts. This work can feed into evolving models that seek to constrain the architecture of the crust within rifts and nascent ocean basins. Insights gained from East Africa have broad implications in understanding rifted margins globally, and how the crust and offshore basins along these margins develop. By examining rocks that are exposed in East Africa, we may generate better conceptual models of regions where these rocks may be buried by kilometers of sediments (e.g., Eastern U.S. seaboard). Broader Impacts include undergraduate research experience.<br/><br/>In this proposal new geochemical and petrographic constraints on lavas from the East African rift will be obtained. The focus will be on lava fields that represent end members in eruption style - large lava flows, isolated shields, and smaller lava cones.  The proposed study regions in East Africa are the following: (i) Afar, a region where researchers vigorously debate if ocean crust is already being formed, and (ii) Turkana, a region where an earlier rifting event has made the crust thinner than would be anticipated. The work being undertaken in this proposal will be arranged around four interlinked questions: (A) What is the mechanism of magma generation for the different lavas fields? (B) What mantle sources contribute to magma creation within these lavas fields? (C) How does magma generation/ source contribution change over time? (D) Is there a difference in the conditions of magma evolution within the crust between the different lava fields? The region this project focuses on spans two of the targets elucidated by the GeoPRISMS Implementation Plan. Turkana lies within the ""Primary area for focused investigations"", while Afar lies within the ""collaborative target"" region. Thus, the results of this study can be collated with other NSF-sponsored science being undertaken in the same region to address GeoPRISMS science goals. When combined, these data will be used to address the science question: ""How is strain accommodated and partitioned throughout the lithosphere, and what are the controls on strain localization and migration?""  The results of this work will have further impact upon other science questions related to the distribution of deep mantle material in the East African upper mantle. These questions are currently being addressed through other interdisciplinary studies and the proposed work would add a critical component to the the constraints on the rifting process that is recorded in the recent lavas. When considered in aggregate, these studies aim to push the boundaries of current knowledge as to how rifting initiates, evolves, and transitions to oceanic spreading.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Billions of dollars are already spent mapping and 3D modeling the real world for these and many other applications, but these virtual cities are created through painstaking manual methods that can take months to years, or lack necessary information about what is in the world. This SBIR Phase II project will make it possible to rapidly and automatically create detailed 3D copies of any area of the real world.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed 3D models of the world for diverse commercial applications. This project introduces new methods for turning raw multimodal sensor data into semantic information describing the world and immersive, interactive-ready 3D models. It will remove the time, money, and manual effort necessary to create accurate 3D models of real world areas today, by using computer intelligence instead of human effort to parse sensor data like photographs and laser scans. The resulting 3D models and underlying semantic information describing the world will be used directly in game engines and simulation software, in analysis tools, in rendering software, and beyond. This research will build on the associated Phase I project, first improving the detail that can be identified and reproduced in virtual copies of the real world, then showing readiness for commercialization with paying customers. The result of the project will be a market-ready product for an initial market segment, capable of accurately reproducing real cities in 3D models that customers can readily use, as well as traction that demonstrates customer need for the product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, fundamental insights into the multi-scale problem of particle energization in magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence -- a major goal of the research project -- will lead to an improved ability to achieve the societal goal of predicting the impacts of extreme space weather events, in particular the acceleration of hazardous solar energetic particles by these mechanisms.<br/><br/>Plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection are two grand challenge problems in heliophysics, and the overlap and interplay of these two incompletely understood mechanisms represents an important frontier for heliophysics research.  This three-year research project targets a major unanswered question on this frontier, namely: to what extent does magnetic reconnection play a role in the dissipation of plasma turbulence at small scales?  In order to make progress in answering this fundamental question, during this project magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence simulations will be performed using both the AstroGK and Gkeyll kinetic simulation codes.  The project teams will investigate the particle energization using a guiding-center analysis and a pressure tensor calculation, along with a single-point field-particle correlation analysis to determine the characteristic velocity-space signatures of specific energization mechanisms associated with collisionless magnetic reconnection.  Finally, these signatures will be sought in the turbulent magnetosheath plasma by analyzing the electromagnetic field and particle velocity distribution function measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.<br/><br/>This three-year project will support the education and Ph.D. thesis research of a graduate student in space plasma physics at the University of Iowa.  Furthermore, a refined implementation of the novel field-particle correlation technique to the analysis of particle energization in heliospheric plasmas can be subsequently applied to understand the fundamentals of plasma heating and particle acceleration in space and astrophysical plasmas due to turbulence, reconnection, or collisionless shocks; this is a major goal of the heliophysics community as outlined by the 2013 NRC Heliophysics Decadal survey.  The research results obtained during the project will be disseminated broadly through presentations to the scientific community at national and international meetings and publication in the peer-reviewed literature.  Elements of this research will be incorporated into public outreach events for school audiences of all ages as well as public lectures on plasma physics, astrophysics, and space physics.

A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many ecosytems are characterized by a few dominant plants, but it is unclear if these species will remain dominants as environmental conditions change. The loss of dominant species may have a large impact, creating a potential cascade of effects on the overall structure and function of the ecosystem. Ongoing work at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico indicates that a common desert grass is gradually replacing a widespread Great Plains grass. To understand how changes in rainfall amount, timing and variability affect the rate, amount and direction of reordering among the dominant grass species, this project will link the effects of species reordering to carbon cycling and net primary production. Experiments will alter water, temperature and nitrogen availability to test how grasslands respond to these environmental changes. Dryland ecosystems, which cover ~45% of global continental land area, have measurable impacts on the global carbon budget. Drylands are changing rapidly in response to droughts, air pollution, and increased rainfall variability. Community reordering may be key to advancing the understanding of different global change factors affecting dryland ecosystems in the southwestern United States and elsewhere.<br/> <br/><br/>Grasslands cover >240 million ha (33% of land area) in the continental US, providing valuable resources for  livestock, wildlife habitat, water resources, recreation, and carbon storage.  Three experiments will test how environmental change alters the presence, success and contiuity of 2 important grasslands, one dominated by the Chihuahuan Desert grass, black grama, and the other by Great Plains grass, blue grama. Both are important forage grasses that respond differently to global change. One experiment will alter the severity of drought and seasonality of rainfall, while a second experiment manipulates warming, nitrogen fertilization and winter (El Nino) rainfall on plots located in the ecotone where blue and black grama co-occur. The third experiment alters the size and frequency of summer rain events in black grama grassland, which is most likely to experience future invasion by native shrubs (another kind of reordering among species). To improve understanding of the causes and consequences of community reordering among these species, measurements of important carbon processes (root production and soil respiration) along with additions of seeds and biological soil crusts will directly test for interactive effects of plant and microbe community reordering on ecosystem function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in numerous applications in the marine environment (e.g., in surveillance, environmental monitoring, security, and search-and-rescue), human assessment is necessary for efficient and effective task completion. Current technology for underwater exploration sees limited applications of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) but relies heavily on remotely operated vehicles, which unfortunately does not take advantage of robot autonomy. This project will develop novel algorithms and protocols to enable humans to communicate safely with AUVs while preserving and leveraging their autonomy. Specifically, the intent is to create novel methods for gesture- and motion-based bidirectional human-robot communication methods and enable autonomous underwater robots to detect, identify and interact with specific individuals. The research objectives will be evaluated individually and as an integrated, coherent system onboard underwater vehicles. The proposed research has the potential to create a fundamentally new direction in human-in-the-loop field robotics, with underwater robot companions being able to assist divers in a range of tasks and even learning to carry out these tasks in an autonomous manner, greatly reducing risk to humans. This research will also impact a broad range of disciplines, including human-machine dialog, machine vision, activity recognition, and robot control.<br/><br/>This research will develop novel algorithms and protocols to enable humans to communicate safely with AUVs while preserving and leveraging their autonomy. Specific goals include: development of a gesture-based human-to-robot language with multiple communication granularities; creation of algorithms for visual identification of humans by learning from spatial and periodic cues; and development of a non-verbal, motion-based underwater robot-to-human communication scheme.  The research objectives will be evaluated individually and as an integrated, coherent system onboard underwater vehicles.  The investigation into gesture-based visual languages will quantify the detectability, usability, and efficacy of such methods in realistic settings. Statistical, convolutional and generative learning-based approaches will be applied to understand both identifiable human features and gestural communication. Additionally, robot body language and motion will be used as cues for robot-to-human non-verbal communication. These methods will be quantitatively and qualitatively validated via user studies and robot field trials to characterize their advantages and limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development and subsequent intensification of these surface cyclones (cyclogenesis) is often preceded by the development of a disturbance 9-13 kilometers above the surface (i.e., the upper-troposphere and lower-stratosphere). Studies of cyclogenesis have revealed two stages:  First, development of an upper-tropospheric front and associated extrusion of stratospheric air into the upper and mid-troposphere associated with wind shear in cyclogenesis.  Second, a period of development during which shear is converted to curvature in cyclogenesis.  It has been shown that processes of extrusion of stratospheric air into the upper-troposphere and the subsequent conversion of these two steps are not only important in configuring the upper-trough for subsequent cyclogenesis, but also in shaping the subsequent intensification rate of the cyclone. It is unclear how these processes synergistically interact or what individual importance each of these processes assumes in cyclogenesis. <br/><br/>This project will explore how small changes to the initial conditions of simulated upper-tropospheric cyclone precursors impacts the evolution of the surface cyclone. The results of this proposed project will provide insight into the timing and location of critical processes occurring in the upper-troposphere prior to cyclogenesis and potentially offer insight into improvements in reducing the uncertainty associated with predictions of the intensity of these weather events. The fundamental research conducted in this project is consistent with NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science. The broader impacts of the proposed activity include the training of graduate students, the organization and hosting of a workshop to explore the predictability of cyclones and their lifecycles, and the organization of a session on mid-latitude lifecycles at the 2022 annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society.<br/><br/>This study proposes to investigate the dynamics of midlatitude cyclogenesis events by addressing the sensitivity of extratropical cyclone development to the evolution of the upper tropospheric cyclogenetic precursor (UTCP) within the framework of case studies of simulated observed cyclogenesis events.  The project combines two well-developed diagnostic techniques (i.e., quasi-geostrophic (QG) diagnostics and adjoint-derived forecast sensitivities) to understand an outstanding issue related to mid-latitude cyclogenesis: the sensitivity of the Type-B cyclone lifecycles to perturbations to the cyclones' upper-tropospheric cyclogenetic precursors. The unique combination of the diagnostic approaches allows for previously unexplored research into understanding the separate and interactive roles of upper-tropospheric, pre-cyclogenetic, barotropic and baroclinic growth processes in modulating surface cyclone lifecycles. We will use a novel experimental approach termed the sensitivity-perturbation-response-diagnosis (SPRD) procedure.  SPRD employs adjoint-derived sensitivity gradients for individual cases to construct optimal perturbations that elicit particular, prescribed responses in the simulated cyclone life cycle for which synoptic-scale QG and potential vorticity (PV) inversion diagnostics of the perturbed cyclone evolutions are performed. Employment of this procedure will result in a comprehensive examination of the structure and evolution of optimal initial-time perturbations influencing the cyclone's development, as well as a test of the appropriateness of the simplifying assumptions in the adjoint model to each particular case.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its long-term goals are: (1) to maximize the scientific payoff from gravitational-wave observations: what can we learn about fundamental gravitational physics, and how will compact binary detections contribute to our understanding of the Universe? (2) to improve our theoretical understanding of compact objects, whether isolated or in binaries, in general relativity and in modified theories of gravity. With the expected increase in volume coverage of LIGO/Virgo and the operation of KAGRA in Japan, this work is timely, geared at enhancing the scope of the physics and astrophysics enabled by ground-based interferometers. The project will train a student in a highly interdisciplinary field that requires expertise in general relativity, astrophysics, data analysis and high-energy physics. The PI's newly established group at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore has long-standing collaborations with groups in the US and in the EU. This network of collaborations will ensure that the student funded by this project will be trained in a vibrant international environment. A key goal of the project is to strengthen collaborations between the gravitational physics community and the larger physics and astrophysics communities at a crucial time for the nascent field of gravitational-wave astronomy. JHU has formal collaborations with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and NASA Goddard (GSFC) and it is home to many world-leading experts in cosmology and astrophysics, so this task will benefit enormously from the group's daily interactions with JHU faculty and STScI astronomers. The PI has a strong track record of training students and postdocs who developed into leading experts working at the interface of these different fields.<br/><br/>The first gravitational-wave detections by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration were a major milestone. Large financial resources have been invested in detector design and in compact binary detection templates, but for gravitational-wave science to make even more groundbreaking contributions we must be able to go beyond detections, extracting fundamental physics from the strong-gravity dynamics of the sources. The PI will investigate the structure and dynamics of compact objects in general relativity and in some well-motivated modified theories of gravity. The theoretical insight gained from these investigations will be used to devise a parametrized, theory-agnostic gravitational-wave data analysis framework to quantify dynamical deviations from general relativity for compact binary mergers in the strong-field regime. To address this problem, the PI's group will adopt the following strategy: (1) identify the simplest, best-motivated modified theories of gravity and physics beyond the Standard Model that would produce black hole spacetimes and/or binary black hole gravitational waveforms that differ from general relativity; (2) compute the corresponding black hole solutions and (whenever possible) the gravitational waves emitted during binary merger and ringdown using a combination of perturbation theory and/or numerical relativity; (3) use these results to learn lessons on how to parametrize strong-field deviations from general relativity in a theory-agnostic way, and implement these parametrizations in gravitational-wave data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators have developed a sophisticated technique for studying asteroids that make close approaches to the Earth (known as Near-Earth Asteroids, or NEAs). They will use their thermophysical model (TPM), together with visible and radar observations of NEAs to investigate the surface properties of the asteroids. While some asteroids are known to have smooth surfaces, others are covered with a thick layer of dust, and still others have regions of each type of surface. These different regions emit and reflect radiation differently, and thus it is important to know the nature of an NEA's surface when interpreting observations. The investigators will use their thermophysical model to interpret reflected and emitted light from NEAs and will identify possible targets for future missions. It should be noted that an understanding of the nature of NEAs would be vital to the defense of the nation should one be discovered on a collision course with Earth. The investigators will involve a postdoctoral student and a graduate student in outreach activities, which will include four workshops for K-12 teachers. <br/><br/>Thermal modeling of asteroids reveals much about their surface properties. Simple thermal models often do not fit multiple observations of the same asteroid self-consistently. Both non-sphericity and surface heterogeneity are required to fully understand an asteroid. The investigators will use multi-epoch observations, with detailed shapes from optical lightcurves and radar data to leverage multiple observation geometries to model the thermal emission more realistically and better constrain the surface properties of NEAs. They will investigate such properties as the heterogeneity of the asteroid surfaces; the degree of roughness on each surface, the importance of thermal inertia and how it varies with size, spectral type, or rotation rate; and how derived thermal parameters using radar-derived shapes compare to those using optical lightcurve-derived shapes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urban systems represent a critical nexus in the food-to-waste process. Across the United States, approximately 31-40% of the food supply, or over 1,250 calories and nearly 1 pound of food per capita per day, is wasted for various reasons. This direct waste represents an estimated 30 million acres of cropland, 4.2 trillion gallons of irrigation water, 780 million pounds of pesticides, and 1.8 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer ""discarded"" with this food waste. City food systems import vast quantities of food for their populations and businesses, and food waste represents the largest component of municipal solid waste. The food-to-waste processes in urban systems provides opportunities to develop more sustainable urban systems. Food is culture, and people have strong relationships with food. Motivating change to reduce wasted food is challenging and requires an understanding of drivers such as psychology, economics, culture, and marketing. Current momentum by cities to implement food waste strategies requires momentum in fundamental research as well. This workshop, scheduled tentatively on August 19-20, 2019, in Baltimore, MD, will convene interdisciplinary urban food system actors, experts in diverse aspects of wasted food, and researchers with the goal of co-creating a research agenda on wasted food as a sustainable urban systems opportunity. The workshop will include academics, city staff, and non-profit representatives. Members of the steering committee include representatives from Johns Hopkins University, the Ohio State University, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the University of California-Berkeley, and the Baltimore Office of Sustainability.<br/><br/>To create a research agenda that addresses needs of practitioners while building a strong scientific basis for future work, a workshop will be held on the food-to-waste process through the convergent lens of urban sustainability, aiming for deep integration across disciplines and between researchers and practitioners. The workshop structure will blend design principles and tools from engineering, public health, economics, and public policy. These principles and tools include a participatory design approach, use of the Center for Government Excellence's Roadmap for Policy Change, an agenda shaped by the UK Design Council's Double Diamond model, and an adapted innovation framework for evaluating and culling the list of future approaches. The conference will include strong community engagement, with an emphasis on diversity and equity. Participants will come from diverse backgrounds and include city staff, non-profit and for-profit practitioners, and academic experts from a wide range of disciplines including public health, engineering, economics, government, environmental science, sociology, food service and hospitality, and business. There will be a pre-conference survey to generate relevant ideas for discussion, and field trips in order to stimulate ideas for future research directions. Conference participation will be open to interested graduate students, and the findings from the event will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders and groups.  The findings will also be incorporated into onsite and online course curricula of the organizing team.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the origin and transport of high-SiO2 rhyolites and what triggers their eruption in large volumes, often explosively, is of considerable interest because their formation must fundamentally re-constitute and differentiate continental crust Additionally, the western U.S. may be the site of future ""supervolcano"" eruptions, and so understanding the process of the eruptive process can yield additional insight into the hazard associated with these eruptions.  Although the chances of a major catastrophic eruption in the western U.S. in the immediate future are low, one of the primary goals of this proposal is to test whether the timescales between rhyolite melt formation and rapid transport to the surface (via dikes) may be on the order of weeks and months (and thus human time scales) and not 10's to 100's of thousands of years.<br/><br/>The overall purpose of this study is to combine dynamic, hydrous partial melting experiments with 1D and 2D high-resolution numerical models to examine how the influx of volatile-bearing basalt into continental crust drives the formation, segregation and eruption of high-SiO2 rhyolitic melts. The high-resolution, numerical models will focus on processes that occur over short spatial (meter) and temporal (days/years) scales, in addition to those that operate over crustal distances (kms) and longer times (Myrs).  There are four important phenomena that are captured by high-resolution models, including: (1) The transfer of exsolved H2O-rich fluid from crystallizing basaltic sills (10-100 m) to adjacent wall rock, (2) The transient (100's of years) heating of the wall rock adjacent to newly emplaced basaltic sills, which leads to significant partial melting of surrounding crust (both granitoid and previously solidified mafic sills) under H2O-present conditions (where fluid-saturated conditions prevail at the solidus, but fluid-absent conditions develop at melt fractions over 20%). (3) The interaction of partial melts of granitoid and previously solidified mafic sills. (4) The role of pre-existing aplite dikes in granitoid wall rock in facilitating the rapid development of melt-filled dikes, and thus rapid transport out of the wall-rock source region.  These short-term processes impact crustal-scale thermal profiles because of the rapid transfer of heat via advection (i.e., dikes). They also lead to significant and irreversible compositional re-working of the upper crust due to the transport of these partial melts from both granitoid and previously solidified mafic sills; thus the re-worked upper crust will carry the geochemical signature of this mixed heritage. Dynamic, hydrous experiments will be performed that simulate the release of H2O fluid from the basaltic sills into adjacent wall rock, and its role in driving partial melting.  The new numerical models and software codes will be made widely available to facilitate scientific reproducibility and comprehension.

Emphasis will be given to the effects that small numbers of important molecules (i.e. genes, RNA, and protein) have on the dynamics of living cells. The lectures will review experimental manifestations of stochastic effects in molecular biology, as can be measured using single-cell and single-molecule techniques. The lectures will discuss the most recent analytical and numerical methods that are used to model these systems and show how these methods can improve interpretation of experimental data. The lecture will discuss how different cellular mechanisms control and/or exploit randomness in order to survive in uncertain environments. Lectures will cover topics spanning many time- and length-scales, from the fundamental issues of cell proliferation and mutation dynamics, to molecular events affecting specific pathways in cells, to population genetics effects. This section of the summer school will include a number of instructor-suggested group projects, in which students will apply various numerical techniques to formulate, identify and solve stochastic models of cancer evolution.

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of most elegant extensions of the Standard Model and allows scientists to address a number of theoretical issues left unresolved by the Standard Model.   These include the origin and stability of certain mass scales which appear in the theory.   SUSY also predicts the existence of certain particles which might serve as ideal candidates for the unseen dark matter of the universe, searches for which are ongoing in a number of experiments worldwide.  SUSY also allows the different fundamental forces to be unified into a single ""grand-unified"" force at high energy scales.   Searches for SUSY are ongoing at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).   SUSY also plays a prominent role in string theory and in many other ideas for physics beyond the Standard Model.   As a result of the central importance of supersymmetry in modern particle physics, the annual SUSY conferences have grown over the past 20 years to become the dominant annual international physics conferences focused on physics beyond the Standard Model. As such, these conferences provide a unique venue for discussions not only on the status of SUSY but also on diverse topics such as connections between particle physics and cosmology, supersymmetry and its alternatives, the Higgs particle, the physics of neutrinos, dark matter, astro-particle physics, gravitational waves, and string theory.  The SUSY conferences also include discussions of results from the Large Hadron Collider, recent neutrino experiments and observations, direct and indirect dark-matter detection experiments, detection of gravitational waves, data from particle colliders, as well as measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure in the universe.  Moreover, starting this year, the SUSY conferences will also be featuring connections between high-energy physics and experimental techniques from Atomic/Molecular/Optical (AMO) physics and Quantum Information Science, thereby increasing the interdisciplinarity of this conference.<br/><br/>SUSY 2019 (the XXVIIth International Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions) will be hosted by Texas A&M University Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC), during May 20-24, 2019.   The annual SUSY conferences are typically attended by large numbers of young postdocs and students each year, and as a result a tradition has developed wherein each SUSY conference is also preceded by a ""school"" or training workshop dedicated to providing these future young researchers the background to fully profit from the contents of the conference, as well as to educate them in state-of-the-art methods of experimental and theoretical high-energy physics. This objective is fulfilled through a series of high-level lectures and talks by well-known active researchers in the field of high-energy physics.  Accordingly, the SUSY 2019 conference will be preceded by a four-day pre-SUSY training workshop which will take place on TAMU-CC campus during the week prior the SUSY 2019 conference (May 15-18, 2019).<br/><br/>Support for the SUSY 2019 Conference and the SUSY 2019 pre-School will have significant broader impacts. Both the Conference and pre-School will help young scientists to interact with theoretical and experimental colleagues and thereby broaden their knowledge of particle physics. These educational goals are important to the integration of young scientists into the community, and to maintain the vibrancy of the field.  As such, support for these events advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science and the training of the next generation of researchers in the United States.   Throughout the planning for this conference, care has been taken to ensure a diverse set of speakers at all levels as well as a diverse set of conference participants.  Moreover, a fund will be made available to help cover the expenses of students from underrepresented institutions, as well as underrepresented minorities and women.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major way to revamp the undergraduate experience in the geosciences (with increased student retention) is through faculty development efforts that focus more on creating active learning environments than perpetuating unsuccessful traditional educational models. Engaging the geoscience community in rich conversations about the goals and content of geoscience and other courses, has the potential to impact many thousands of students across the US.

Groundwater that has lots of iron and arsenic carries huge amounts of these elements to the riverbank sediments. It is important to understand the fate of this trapped arsenic and iron. The goal of this study is to develop a theory on the growth and fate of these iron-arsenic deposits. This project accomplishes this goal by observing which minerals the arsenic is bound to within sediments on the edge of the Meghna River in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has some of the highest naturally occurring levels of arsenic in aquifers in the world. Laboratory experiments will test the impact of tidal fluctuations on the nature of these iron-arsenic deposits. The movement of water and elements will be measured in the field between aquifers and the Meghna River. This project supports the research of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students and prepares the next generation of U.S. and Bangladeshi scientists to understand the movement of toxic elements between aquifers and rivers. <br/><br/>Arsenic-contaminated water resources are prevalent in fluvio-deltaic aquifers whose sediment are the geogenic source. The fate of As in groundwater discharging to rivers, however, remains unknown despite advances in understanding the origin and transport of As in groundwater. A few observations have suggested that As is stored within shallow, permeable, riverbank sediment through sorption on iron-oxide surfaces, referred to herein as Permeable Natural Reactive Barriers (PNRB). These accumulations threaten the communities along rivers should there be a reversal in groundwater flow induced by pumping, or should this high-As sediment be scoured and then re-deposited along a segment of the river where infiltration occurs. In deltaic regions, aquifers are connected to large rivers subject to periodic forcing driven by tides and seasonal flooding. Thus, the dynamics of groundwater-borne As transported to and from rivers should also be driven by similar periodic forcing. The amplitude and period of these fluctuations will uniquely determine the properties of these PNRBs, and knowing this, combined with knowledge of the iron (Fe) and As concentrations of the aquifers, should allow regional prediction of the accumulation of As in riverbank sediment. This project investigates the dynamics of a Fe-oxide PNRB through complementary detailed field characterization of sites along the Meghna River in Bangladesh along with laboratory experimentation and advanced coupled flow and reactive transport simulations. The data-driven modeling is used to assess the occurrence of PNRBs in similar tidal river-aquifer settings through sensitivity analysis. The anticipated findings will advance the understanding of the cycling of geogenic As in shallow, reducing alluvial aquifers connected with rivers in Asia. Critical knowledge on coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for the protection and management of water resources will be provided to both the local communities dealing with As contamination and the broader scientific body. Local stakeholders will be directly involved in the research and project findings will be translated for policy makers to reach affected communities. This study funds the research projects of undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral investigators and expands the infrastructure for studying groundwater-river water exchange along the Meghna River in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ocean temperatures in this region are sensitive to changes in the relative influx of colder currents from the north and warmer currents from the south, which are ultimately linked to the greater regional and global ocean-atmosphere circulation. From 2004 to 2013, the Gulf of Maine warmed faster than 99% of the world's oceans, but the processes driving recent temperature change here are not fully understood. A deeper understanding of oceanographic trends on time scales beyond instrumental records (older than ~100 years) can elucidate the causes of change, determine whether abrupt changes have happened in the past, and shed light on environmental impacts on past coastal communities. This project brings together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and Native American students in New England, who will conduct a 10-day research expedition in the Gulf and delve into the region's past using geochemical evidence buried in ancient marine sediments. Results and research experiences of students will be shared with the broader community via development of an innovative multi-media online storytelling environment and through partnership with local schools. The project has the potential to enhance long-term environmental prediction and planning in an area where human populations and ocean ecosystems have been interlinked for millennia.<br/><br/>Long-term records of ocean temperature and seawater oxygen isotope composition (d18O) will be reconstructed from the magnesium to calcium ratio (Mg/Ca) and d18O of fossil foraminiferal calcite derived from a suite of sediment cores from the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf and Slope. High-resolution (~100 to 200-year interval) records will extend from the start of the Holocene ~11,600 years ago to the present, providing insight into long-term temperature trends as well as any abrupt changes. In addition to traditional whole-shell geochemical analysis, micro-analysis of individual foraminiferal specimens will be conducted to provide complementary data for assessing environmental variability. A research cruise in the Gulf of Maine will provide sediment-core and plankton-tow material as well as hydrographic data for refinement and regional calibration of the geochemical proxies. One key goal is to test and extend the Mg/Ca-temperature calibration for a common high-latitude foraminifer species, Neogloboquadrina incompta. In parallel with paleoceanographic research, artifacts from coastal archaeological sites will be radiocarbon-dated to refine the chronology of fishing practices in the region. In particular, the beginning and end of intensive sword-fishing in coastal communities will be re-dated and reassessed in light of new paleotemperature data. All work will be carried out by a team of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who will gain both technical and communications training in partnership with the Wabanaki Center and the New Media and Internet Technologies Lab at the University of Maine. In addition to developing online narratives that can be widely shared, high school students will practice presenting their research verbally to different groups, including at national meetings. A diverse team of women and men, including a member of the Penobscot Nation, will collaborate to guide and mentor students through the scientific process and to help them develop a voice that can effectively reach diverse audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results may provide insight into the important question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms.  Bose-Einstein condensates are systems that typically contain very cold atoms.  For certain configurations, quantum effects will occur which are in some important ways similar to those that occur for black holes.  Experimental studies of Bose-Einstein condensate analog black holes have been carried out.  Theoretical calculations will be made using the same techniques as are used to study quantum effects related to real black holes.  The results will be compared with the experimental data. The semiclassical approximation has been used to investigate quantum effects such as particle production in a variety of situations including the early universe.  It provides a bridge between macroscopic (classical) and microscopic (quantum) phenomena.  It's validity will be studied for an important model in which the universe is initially contracting, reaches a minimum size, and then begins to expand.  Particle production is expected to be particularly important during the contracting phase where it could significantly alter the dynamical evolution of the universe.  The results will help to determine whether the semiclassical approximation is valid in cases where quantum effects are significant.  Four graduate students, and probably some undergraduates, will participate in some aspects of the research, continuing a long history of their training in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications.  Results will be disseminated to the research community through publications and presentations at national and international meetings.  Some results obtained will be relevant for condensed matter physics.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant addresses black hole evaporation, observable effects in Bose-Einstein condensates which can serve as black hole analogs, and early universe cosmology. Specifically, it will investigate questions related to the information about how a black hole forms, the correspondence between theoretical and experimental results related to quantum effects in analog black hole systems, and the validity of the semi-classical approximation in models of the universe.  In the case of black hole evaporation, the objectives include studying in detail quantum effects that occur if a spherically symmetric null shell collapses to form a black hole.  One goal is to check the accuracy of similar calculations in two dimensional dilaton theories of gravity.  It is also possible that insight will be gained into the question of what happens to the information about how the black hole formed.  Bose-Einstein condensates that can serve as analog black holes have been created in the laboratory.  The goal is to determine whether certain experimental results are in quantitative agreement with predictions resulting from quantum field theory in curved space calculations in the analog spacetime.  The primary goal for cosmology is to determine whether the semiclassical approximation is valid for models in which the universe contracts to a minimum size and then expands.  The models used will consist of a closed universe with a positive cosmological constant.  For the black hole evaporation project the stress-energy tensor for a quantized massless minimally coupled scalar field will be numerically computed in four-dimensions in the case of a null shell that collapses to form the black hole.  For the cosmology project the semiclassical backreaction equations will be solved numerically in the case that a massive conformally coupled scalar field is present.  The results will be used to investigate the validity of the semiclassical approximation in a collapsing universe.  The density density correlation function for a Bose-Einstein condensate analog black hole will be computed using quantum field theory in curved space techniques for a model that closely matches the velocity and sound speed profiles used in the experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, fundamental insights into the multi-scale problem of particle energization in magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence -- a major goal of the research project -- will lead to an improved ability to achieve the societal goal of predicting the impacts of extreme space weather events, in particular the acceleration of hazardous solar energetic particles by these mechanisms.<br/><br/>Plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection are two grand challenge problems in heliophysics, and the overlap and interplay of these two incompletely understood mechanisms represents an important frontier for heliophysics research.  This three-year research project targets a major unanswered question on this frontier, namely: to what extent does magnetic reconnection play a role in the dissipation of plasma turbulence at small scales?  In order to make progress in answering this fundamental question, during this project magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence simulations will be performed using both the AstroGK and Gkeyll kinetic simulation codes.  The project teams will investigate the particle energization using a guiding-center analysis and a pressure tensor calculation, along with a single-point field-particle correlation analysis to determine the characteristic velocity-space signatures of specific energization mechanisms associated with collisionless magnetic reconnection.  Finally, these signatures will be sought in the turbulent magnetosheath plasma by analyzing the electromagnetic field and particle velocity distribution function measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.<br/><br/>This three-year project will support the education and Ph.D. thesis research of a graduate student in space plasma physics at the University of Iowa.  Furthermore, a refined implementation of the novel field-particle correlation technique to the analysis of particle energization in heliospheric plasmas can be subsequently applied to understand the fundamentals of plasma heating and particle acceleration in space and astrophysical plasmas due to turbulence, reconnection, or collisionless shocks; this is a major goal of the heliophysics community as outlined by the 2013 NRC Heliophysics Decadal survey.  The research results obtained during the project will be disseminated broadly through presentations to the scientific community at national and international meetings and publication in the peer-reviewed literature.  Elements of this research will be incorporated into public outreach events for school audiences of all ages as well as public lectures on plasma physics, astrophysics, and space physics.

Microplasma discharge devices, which are based on non-thermal or cold plasmas, have been receiving growing interest for various applications in the food, biomedical and health care industries. The performance of the devices is dependent on a stable and uniform microplasma discharge. To maintain a uniform distribution of microplasma discharge, the devices are often operated with high input voltages along with the use of inert gases such as argon, neon, helium, xenon and nitrogen. However, the use of high voltages and inert gases are a safety hazard and prohibits the development of portable microplasma discharge devices. To overcome these limitations, the microplasma discharge devices are operated in controlled environments and specialized chambers, under stable atmospheric conditions, thus making the systems complex, bulky, non-portable and expensive. Even though novel microplasma discharge devices that operate in atmospheric air can be developed to address these drawbacks, the devices are exposed to varying ambient conditions including dynamic temperature, pressure and humidity changes. This further multiplies the challenges associated with the development of optimum microplasma discharge devices because of the changes in electron density, electron mobility and electron temperature due to the varying ambient conditions. The EAGER grant is used for developing a deep understanding of the microplasma discharge dynamics such as electron density, electron mobility and electron temperature under varying ambient conditions. The research has the potential to advance the development of adaptive control systems for microplasma discharge devices. This could have a profound technological and economic impact on the emerging flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) and wearable biomedical industries. The results obtained from this project will be disseminated through research publications in peer reviewed journals as well as in presentations at regional, national and international conferences.<br/><br/>The research under this EAGER grant aims to radically reduce the risk associated in developing novel microplasma discharge devices and study the microplasma discharge performance that has not been investigated before. Numerical two-dimensional fluid simulations and finite element analysis will be performed to model the microplasma dynamics of different microplasma discharge device configurations with varying electrode designs, electrode gaps and overall device dimensions, at varying ambient conditions. The results will enable optimization of the microplasma discharge device parameters for consistent electron density and electron mobility. This will facilitate uniform voltage distribution across the surface of the electrodes resulting in uniform generation of microplasma discharge. The dielectric barrier discharge and breakdown voltage analysis will be performed on the optimized electrode configuration to understand the optimum breakdown voltage required for microplasma discharge. Finite element modelling and simulations of the microplasma discharge dynamics such as electron density, electron mobility and electron temperature will be completed for varying ambient temperature, pressure and humidity. The results will be utilized to generate a detailed database that can be used for designing and fabricating novel microplasma discharge devices which can be integrated with adaptive control systems for the development of novel microplasma discharge device based systems. The fundamental breakthroughs from this research will eliminate the risks associated with optimizing microplasma discharge devices for applications such as sterilization, wound disinfection and surface treatments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A 2017 market research by Photonics21 determined the global market for photonics products at $507 billion in 2015. During the four-year period, 2011 - 2015, this market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. In spite of such strong role of photonic materials in everyday life, few universities in the United States, indeed the whole world, offer educational opportunities for the students to learn the subject at a sufficiently advanced level (blending optics and materials science disciplines) to enable multi-disciplinary breakthroughs that advance the state of art in photonic materials R&D. Even the few institutions that offer a course in photonic materials do not provide hands-on, practical experience for the making and characterization of such materials. This one-week long international summer school (the School) will bridge this disconnect, filling the void in the training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students of materials science and engineering, and postdocs engaged in related research. The American Ceramic Society and its Glass and Optical Materials Division along with the Ceramic and Glass Industry Foundation will assist in the recruiting, assessing and selection of the qualified applicants. The Centre d'Optique, Photonique et Laser (COPL) at Laval University, Quebec City, Canada, which is a leading institution in the world in the area of the Optics and Photonics, will host the School, June 15-19, 2019. It has offered to open its laboratories for the participants to carry out hands-on team-based projects. It will also provide logistical support and facilitate interfacing with the strong local Photonic industry base.<br/>The School will comprise of lectures by 22 international experts from six countries, who will introduce the participants to five complementary aspects of photonic and optical materials: 1. Scope of optical materials; 2. Properties and characterization of photonic materials; 3. Fibers and fiber-based photonic systems; 4. Advanced materials for system applications, especially planar photonic materials; and 5. Outlook for photonic materials, especially in relation the needs of next generation photonic technology needs. The School will train 40 students and 10 postdocs who will form interdisciplinary, mentor/mentee teams to use lecture based tutorials to solve lab-based experimental and theoretical problems. Approximately half the attendee cohort will be selected from US institutions, and an equal number from the rest of the world. The participation of US students will be managed by Lehigh University. In addition to bringing students together with world-leading lecturers, the School will help establish an international community of young photonic materials scientists who will be prepared to collaborate and build careers while advancing the state of photonic and optical materials.  Overall, the first North American Summer School on Photonic Materials promises to provide a most effective mechanism to train best cadre of young materials researchers in the cutting edge photonic and optical materials research. The support from NSF will ensure the participation of young US scientists in this exceptional, international educational experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in climate cause communities to adapt to enhance resiliency and foster practices that are more appropriate for new conditions. In regions where dry seasons are increasingly longer, shorter rainy seasons experience more severe storms. Rural and agricultural communities are especially vulnerable to new seasonal conditions and their resources for adaptation are limited. The Dry Corridor of Central America (spanning parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) is an important region for agriculture and needs adaptation strategies. The project location is ideal because of its many-decades history of changing climate. Regions of the western United States are also becoming more arid and experience more extreme rainfall events. Effective adaptation and resiliency strategies incorporate combinations of technological and societal changes. The collaborative model in this study consists of experts in hydrology and watershed studies, ethnography and participatory research, agriculture, and community outreach. Researchers and professionals from Michigan Technological University, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), and Lutheran World Relief (LWR), a US-based international relief organization that is starting a multiyear project to strengthen communities for disaster mitigation?are filling the needed expertise to achieve the project objectives. The project team and student participants are incorporating hydrometeorological data into forecasting tools to provide data-driven recommendations for rural agricultural communities so they are more resilient to water scarcity and flooding. Students learn new collaborative research methods in an international context to enhance their capabilities for working in socially and culturally diverse settings to address complex problems in land-use management in a changing climate and challenging landscapes. <br/><br/>Students work with mentors/experts in social and hydrological sciences research and education in agricultural communities in the Dry Corridor of El Salvador. The project participants work with local farmers and agricultural stakeholders to gain experience in adapting to climate change. The interdisciplinary scientists and development professionals work together in participatory research in communities experiencing water scarcity and extreme rainfall events. Students collect hydrometeorological and community data to use in computational tools to understand and forecast the hydrological system in steep-sloped, semi-arid area subject to changing land-use. The increased hydrological understanding along with participatory, community-based research better informs decision-makers about more appropriate agricultural and water management practices in response to observed changes in the regional climate. The research team measures the effectiveness of these strategies on crop yields, water usage, and impacts of precipitation-related hazards. The research aims to inform farmers and other local stakeholders about hydrological factors that influence crop yields in areas with highly variable weather and climate. The research will influence decisions regarding crop selection, planting practices, and irrigation. Each year a new diverse cohort of ten US graduate students with different, but complementary, disciplinary backgrounds work together on issues related to these hazards. The students participate in an 8-week international educational and research experience, working with experts in hydrological modeling, participatory research, agriculture, and hydrological and meteorological monitoring. Professional development activities for the student participants further the broader impacts of this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The understanding of the interrelated roles of microstructure, defects, and growth that are the focus of this workshop is central to a deeper understanding and development of these materials. This event will bring together researchers of international and national stature as well as recent PhDs and graduate students to present and discuss the latest advances. The meeting will differ from other similar events in that it will be without parallel sessions. This emphasis on a smaller, single-track meeting will be conducive to a more focused program and will also promote collaborations between engineers, mathematicians, and physicists for the creation and development of new mathematical methods and physical concepts. Funding for this workshop will go towards supporting speakers as well as 15 young researchers to attend and interact with leading researchers in the fields of mechanics and mathematics. <br/><br/>This three-day workshop will involve a total of 17 lectures. Eight of these will be one-hour lectures given by prominent leading researchers from the fields of mechanics and mathematical sciences. Another eight 30-minute roundtable discussion lectures will be given by a mix of leading researchers and promising young researchers, postdocs, and PhD students.

How does climate mediate the sedimentary record and under what conditions can erosional signals be observed and interpreted unambiguously in terms of paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic change? The primary goals of this Geological Society of America (GSA) Penrose conference are i) to redefine the current state of research and identify the remaining key questions within this scientific community, ii) to present and discuss recent advances in understanding erosional records mediated directly and indirectly by paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental change, iii) to enhance the training of early career researchers (ECRs), especially from traditionally underrepresented communities, through networking and discussion among international scientists, and iv) to produce a GSA Special Publication following the proceedings of this conference. This award supports the participation of 15 student and ECRs, and three mid-career U.S. female scientists who lack support and are essential for critical mentoring activities.<br/><br/>While it has long been recognized that bedrock erosion is increased by glaciation and heavier precipitation, the relationship among climatic, erosional, and sediment transport processes is more complex than that defined between erosion and tectonics. It has become clear that these relationships are rarely linear and furthermore vary across timescales of observation and within different tectonic settings. While climate-tectonic-erosion interactions have been the subject of numerous past workshops the influence of climate on erosion and sediment transport, especially on shorter timescales, has received less scrutiny. This GSA Penrose conference will address these issues with a group of 70-80 attendees in early August 2019. The group will be drawn from a variety of subdisciplines to further define and quantify the interrelationships amongst these processes. This is an especially opportune time to redefine community goals and undertake this synthesis because of the wealth of new climate records and long-term sedimentary records collected through international initiatives, most notably speleothem and the recently acquired monsoon records from IODP. Advances in techniques for dating erosional products, in tracing sediment sources, and modelling coupled climate-landscape systems now allow for much improved correlations to be made with greater confidence and further our fundamental understanding of the driving and reactive physical processes.

The related research is ongoing, and most models rely on macroscopic (fluid) models of the solar wind.  When kinetic effects, such as wave-particle interaction, are considered, however, the approach is usually not self-consistent in that certain types of wave turbulence is presupposed, and the wave spectra are modeled.  In contrast, the theoretical model to be developed as part of this three-year project will be fully kinetic and self-consistent.  This will significantly advance the knowledge in the field of heliospheric physics.  The model to be developed as part of this project will predict a particular state in which the solar wind plasma exists given a set of parameters, allowing the observed quantities to be tested against historic spacecraft data as well the planned measurements of the near-Sun environment that will be obtained by the Parker Solar Probe.  Although the present project is a theoretical one, rather than one involving data analysis, the resulting prediction may help experimentalists better interpret the past and future spacecraft data.  This has the potential to advance knowledge in a related, but different field of expertise, namely experimental heliophysics.<br/><br/>This three-year research project will investigate theoretically how the kinetic coupling of electrons and ions (protons) via collisional and instability processes affect the large-scale dynamics in the expanding solar wind.  The specific problem to be investigated relates to how the dynamically coupled solar wind electrons and protons contribute to the near isotropization of their temperatures -- an observed phenomena which has not yet been satisfactorily explained theoretically.  The PI's preliminary work based upon the assumption of bi-Maxwellian particle distribution shows that collisional process may be the dominant mechanism for the isotropization of temperatures, but the instabilities are important too for limiting the upper/lower bounds of temperature anisotropies. This project aims to extend the preliminary work by relaxing the assumption of bi-Maxwellian model in both instability analysis and collisional transport calculation.  The full kinetic equations for particles and waves, as well as the dispersion relation, will be solved by grid-based numerical scheme.  The collisional transport equation will also be solved by relaxing the assumption of bi-Maxwellian models.  Finally, the effects of inhomogeneities will be rigorously investigated by solving the macro-microscopic kinetic equation.<br/><br/>The research on the theoretical modeling of the solar wind is important from the broader perspective of understanding and characterizing fundamental processes that take place within the heliosphere and throughout the universe.  Discovering and understanding the basic physical processes in the immediate near-Earth environment and in the wider universe is essential for future human explorations of the universe, and it also has a space environmental impact, as the modern civilization is increasingly dependent on electromagnetic conditions in outer space.  Developing an accurate model of the solar wind contributes to such a wider goal. From the perspective of education and training, the present proposal involves a young post-doctoral research associate, which is a major strength in terms of Broader Impacts.  It is important for the healthy scientific future of our nation -- and the entire human society -- that a steady stream of young scientists are educated and trained in STEM disciplines.  The PI has in the past always strived to educate and widely disseminate the scientific knowledge acquired during his career to younger generation of scientists both from the U.S. and worldwide.  The present proposal will thus have a broader impact on the education and training of a young scientist.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behavior of fluid-like media in rotating stars and gas giant planets, in the oceans and molten cores of rotating Earth-like planets, and in plasmas with strong magnetic fields is profoundly affected by the forces associated with the overall rotation on the medium itself.  These forces lead to the emergence of well ordered, slowly varying sheared flows. Theory predicts that all such systems share the same underlying origin of the sheared flows via a quantity known as the potential vorticity. In a rotating fluid, for example in geophysical, planetary and stellar systems, the potential vorticity is given by a combination of the local fluid vorticity and the planetary rotation itself.  The experimental study supported by this award will make the first-ever attempt to directly test the role that potential vorticity plays in the formation of sheared flows in turbulent magnetized plasmas and will have broader implications for future development of fusion energy sources.  The experiment will be performed on the COMPASS plasma device in the Czech Republic, and the subsequent data analysis will be carried out by upper-division undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will provide an experimental test of the theoretical prediction that turbulence-generated shear flows appear in magnetized toroidal plasmas due to the effects of a strong Lorentz force, and as such follow similar underlying nonlinear dynamics to that responsible for shear flow formation found in the atmospheres of planets and stars due to the effects of the Coriolis force.  Should this experiment demonstrate that this is the case, it would provide a strong link between these two seemingly disparate physical systems. Should the result show that the prediction is in fact incorrect, it would then force a fundamental rethinking of the theory. In either case, the outcome will impact our understanding of self-organization processes in turbulent fluid and plasma systems.

The southern section of the SAF has not produced a major earthquake in historic times (over the last 300 years), and is currently believed to pose the largest seismic risk in California. This project will use new seismic and geodetic observations to investigate the sub-surface structure and geometry of the Southern San Andreas Fault (SSAF). In particular, the project will test a hypothesis that the SSAF may not be vertical and may substantial dip to the East. If confirmed, a non-vertical fault dip would have important implications for the mechanics and the long-term tectonic evolution of the SSAF. Better knowledge of the sub-surface geometry of the SSAF will also improve  predictions of seismic radiation patterns and the intensity of ground shaking due to future large earthquakes on the SSAF. The broader impacts of this work will be refined estimates of seismic hazard in densely populated areas in Southern California and Mexico as well as support for the education of two graduate students.<br/><br/>The researchers from this joint project between the University of California San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Southern California, will investigate the fault attitude at depth by imaging a low-rigidity damage zone and/or a bi-material interface associated with the SSAF in the upper crust. This will be accomplished by deploying a dense seismic array spanning the SSAF. Data from the deployed seismic array and regional seismic networks will be used to generate high-resolution tomographic images of the fault zone throughout the seismogenic layer. Seismic data will be combined with high-resolution geodetic observations, including Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). A joint analysis of seismic and geodetic data will provide new insights into the spatial extent and degree of damage around a mature plate boundary fault and enable comparisons with observations from other faults in California and elsewhere to examine how the distribution and amount of damage might depend on the fault age, seismic potential, and geometric complexity. The deployment of co-located dense seismic and geodetic arrays will establish a baseline for future measurements of possible time-dependent variations in mechanical properties of rocks comprising the fault zone due to external stress perturbations, which may help constrain the magnitude of absolute stress at seismogenic depth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the majority of known mathematical methods are insufficient for a complete analysis of a combination of these theories, or quantum gravity. Fascinating phenomena such as the very first stages of the big bang or the cores of black holes therefore remain out of reach for our current understanding. This project promotes the progress of science by deriving new methods and investigating systems in which both general relativity and quantum mechanics are relevant. Applications to mathematical models of the big bang and black holes will lead to conclusions that are of interest to the public at large. They further our knowledge about the universe, for instance by providing new tests of general relativity for strong gravitational fields.  Methods derived in this project can also be used for systems that do not involve general relativity, where they may help to solve technical questions or to communicate results in a new way. The project therefore supports education, for instance in teaching quantum mechanics. This project also supports diversity by including undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to introduce and evaluate new methods for a systematic analysis of physical implications of one set of candidate theories of quantum gravity, based on canonical quantization. Throughout physics a powerful tool to derive potentially observable phenomena is given by effective theories which provide quantum corrections to the classical equations. Such systems can more easily be evaluated, analytically or numerically, than equations for quantum states. They are therefore more direct sources for the discovery of new phenomena. While standard techniques to derive effective equations do not apply to canonical quantum gravity, a general scheme applicable to canonical quantum theories exists (introduced by the PI) and is used in this project to address some of the main problems of quantum gravity. During this funding period emphasis will be put on understanding implications of possible non-associative structures in quantum physics, as well as non-classical space-time effects around black holes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Practitioners describe these efforts as ""design thinking"" or evidence-based approaches, which places the end users at the center of each stage of the policy-making process. After policy proposals are formulated, they are tested and validated through various forms of experimentation. In addition to co-creating and re-imagining policies and public programs, PILs also undertake a wide range of activities such as preparing prospective studies, organizing creativity workshops, or instilling a sense of empowerment through training and other learning activities. Nearly all US-based PILs are relatively new undertakings with a median age of two years. The PIL life cycle is dynamic.  Every year, a handful of labs are created while other programs are placed into ""hibernation"" or cut for a number of reasons, including budget reductions, shifts in political agendas, or changes in elected leaders.  However, little is known about how US-based PILs operate in federal, state, and municipal governments or in civil society.  There has been little critical appraisal of this type of ""design thinking"" in a US context.  Second, PILs may potentially play an important role in ""rethinking design"" and formulating innovative science-based policies.  An overlooked feature of PILs is space for STEM disciplines to contribute to policy design and innovations efforts.  This particularly important in emerging data science and engineering fields such as big data, algorithmic governance, artificial intelligence, or 3-D printing. This proposal seeks to understand the emergence of STEM-based policy innovation labs. These labs have the potential to improve understanding at the science-policy interface and to promote public engagement of science and evidence-based policy.<br/><br/>Assessing US-based PILs will draw on four complementary methodological approaches.  First, a review of existing academic and grey literature will be undertaken.  This will inform the design of a web-based survey of US based PILs.   The survey will assess the types of labs, their focus (e.g. social issues, environment & energy, local economic development, migration, digital economy, health & well-being, transportation), their lifespan, the role of STEM tools, and their geographic location, their function (e.g., design-led labs, open government/data labs, evidence-based labs, and mixed labs).  Third, a hyperlink network analysis, which applies social network methods, to a vast number of hyperlinks which utilizes the links between websites.  This cost-effective methodology for studying the extent of PIL networks, their network structures, linking patterns and dynamics. From the online survey and network analysis, 7-9 case study PILs will be selected from which semi-structured interviews of PIL employee and stakeholders will be conducted in order to assess factors responsible for the rise, formation, and functioning of PILs.  Finally, case study analysis will assess if STEM-based universities would be feasible environment for science-policy based PILs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living organisms must cope with repetitive arrivals of unfavorable conditions for survival. Therefore species around the world are under evolutionary pressure to schedule their ""life cycles"" or ""life histories"" to fit the environmental cycle regimes within which they reside. Recent climate change has shifted historical cyclical patterns in many ecosystems, such as season length, resulting in mismatches between life histories and the ideal environmental conditions of plants and animals, to the detriment of population persistence and ecological stability.  Adaptive evolution offers a mechanism that may buffer these mismatches. Accumulating evidence of shifts in life history schedules from around the world shows us that much remains to be done to understand how life histories are ""fit"" to environmental cycles, and to changes in cycles, despite their everyday familiarity.  Testing theoretical ideas with data and experiments is essential. Marine coastal habitats are subject to conspicuous cycles occurring at multiple time scales, such as diel, tidal, lunar, seasonal, and multi-annual fluctuations. Populations of the intertidal crustacean Tigriopus californicus occupy rocky shore across the entire eastern Pacific coastline in upper tidepools that are periodically wave-swept at high tide at varying intervals. This project develops mathematical models to uncover fundamental rules of life history variation and adaptation in regularly varying environments, and tests hypotheses across Tigriopus californicus populations experiencing varying tidal disturbances using efficient and highly replicated field collections and manipulative experiments in the lab. Beyond producing broadly applicable theory and abundant open-access data, the investigators engage with local Makah Tribe students near field sites for sampling and natural history studies to enhance STEM education in an underserved rural community. Furthermore, the project expands the nation?s scientific capacity by training undergraduate and graduate students in experimental design, theoretical modelling in population ecology and life history evolution, and data analysis.<br/><br/>How natural populations persist in variable environments has been a long-standing question in ecology and evolution. In particular, cyclical variability is common in nature, and many species show predictable life history strategies that follow cycles in nature (e.g. phenology). However, a general conceptual framework is lacking for how adaptation to cycles occurs and how the scaling of life histories to fluctuations buffers changes in the environment. Marine environments fluctuate predictably across a range of temporal scales, such as tidal and seasonal, and provide unique opportunities to study population persistence and evolution in cyclical environments. A general mathematical framework is developed that explores life history optimization in the context of cyclically varying environments. The marine intertidal copepod Tigriopus californcus is ideal for testing model predictions and motivating extensions. Many isolated populations can be sampled entirely in the field, and the short timescale of tide cycles, short generation times, and ease of frequent sampling will provide a dense dataset of eco-evolutionary patterns in response to natural disturbance regimes. Pilot studies have established experimental populations in the laboratory, and have proven that Tigriopus californcus is amenable to careful manipulations of simulated disturbance frequency (both cyclical and stochastic) that seamlessly translate to the model framework. The combination of modelling, field parameterization, and experimental investigation of life histories in cyclical and stochastic environments is a novel and holistic approach to the question of life history diversity within an environment. Finally, a general understanding of evolutionary mechanisms in cyclical environments can improve predictions of the fate of populations when natural cycles are perturbed, which is expected across many ecosystems due to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To guarantee safe and efficient operation of CAVs, emerging cellular networks must support services with ultra-reliability and low-latency requirements (e.g., emergency braking) together with mobile broadband applications that need very high data rates (e.g., high-definition maps). Meeting such stringent requirements for large number of CAVs is beyond the capacity of existing networks that operate at scarce sub-6 gigahertz frequencies. Furthermore, while high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) bands offer large bandwidth, mmWave communications pose new challenges in terms of reliability that stem from inherent propagation characteristics of mmWave signals. To address these challenges, the goal of this research is to develop a holistic framework that enables seamless multiplexing of heterogeneous C-V2X traffic over aggregated mmWave and sub-6 GHz frequencies, while taking into account unique limitations and complementary features of communications at each frequency band. This research is accompanied by a comprehensive educational plan that includes mentoring graduate and undergraduate students to participate in research and testbed development, as well as various outreach events for underserved students at local schools.<br/><br/>This fundamental research enables inter-frequency range carrier aggregation to manage the heterogeneous  vehicle-to-everything communication (C-V2X) traffic jointly over mmWave and sub-6 GHz bands and to optimize mobility management for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), while addressing key challenges of mmWave links such as reliability and sparsity. Given the ongoing efforts by standardization groups are primarily focused on carrier aggregation over a single frequency range, new schemes for modeling, optimization, and performance analysis of C-V2X communications are required that account for fundamental differences between mmWave and sub-6 GHz communications. To this end, this framework brings forward novel solutions at the intersections of wireless networking, edge computing, graph theory, and reliability theory, to achieve the following key innovations: 1) Designing new flexible frame structures to dynamically manage the heterogeneous C-V2X traffic over the aggregated mmWave and sub-6 GHz frequency ranges; 2) Analyzing the end-to-end performance of the proposed multi-band radio access network (RAN) with advanced features such as RAN function splitting and edge computing capabilities; 3) Optimizing the mobility management for CAVs based on the derived end-to-end performance metrics; and 4) Developing a comprehensive simulation testbed to evaluate the proposed schemes.

The problems with direct measurement largely stem from the vast scales of space and time that are of interest in understanding global circulation.  One tool for estimating global circulation patterns that holds promise is seen in neodymium isotopes which appear to be powerful tracers of deep ocean circulation, over a variety of timescales.  Unfortunately, the elemental behavior of neodymium contrasts the isotopic behavior of neodymium in the oceans, a puzzle branded the ""neodymium paradox.""  This inconsistency of geochemical behavior opens to question the application of neodymium isotopes as a tracer of circulation.  Therefore, scientists from Oregon State University, Tulane University, and Bigelow Laboratory of Ocean Sciences propose to test the hypothesis that there is a yet unconstrained (even poorly identified) source of neodymium to the oceans that can explain the discrepancies seen between the elemental and isotopic neodymium marine budgets.  The scientists further seek to understand the mechanistic cause of this source and thus be able to start making global constraints on its influence.  Understanding these processes will fundamentally change our interpretations of neodymium data and allow us to more accurately quantify ocean circulation with a greater degree of confidence.  For outreach activities, the scientists plan to participate in open house days held at Oregon State University, da Vinci days, National Ocean Science Bowls, Salmon Bowl and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences' Cafe Scientifique.  Undergraduate students and one graduate student from Tulane University would be supported and trained as part of this project.  <br/><br/>Scientists from Oregon State University, Tulane University, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences propose to test the hypothesis that there is a benthic source of neodymium (Nd) to the oceans that exerts a primary control over the distribution of this element and its isotopes (eNd) in the ocean.  This benthic flux results from early diagenetic reactions that release rare earth elements (REEs) from the solid phase to pore fluid.  The scientists contend this flux will explain eNd distributions throughout the modern and past global oceans. The planned research will be guided by three questions:<br/>(1) What are the mechanisms that control the magnitude and isotope composition of the benthic flux?<br/>(2) What are the relationships among bottom water, pore fluid, and the terminal solid phase compositions? Particularly, how and under what chemical conditions does an eNd signature become part of a preserved archival record of [Nd] and eNd?<br/>(3) Can our understanding of the deep water benthic fluxes account for the integrated bottom water eNd as a function of apparent water mass age and circulation path (e.g., how do the pore fluid and solid phase values reconcile with the existing water column signature and water mass age data)?<br/>To test these ideas, sediments and their pore fluids will be collected from a diverse set of deep sea sites in the Pacific Ocean that reflect slow-to-fast sedimentation rates, carbonate-, terrigenous-, volcaniclastic- and siliceous-sediment, and low-to-high organic carbon.  The sediments and porewater samples, as well as samples from the overlying water column will be characterized for the following parameters: major, minor, and trace metals, Nd isotopes, carbonate chemistry, oxygen, nutrients, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, radiocarbon, porosity, and grain size.  With these observations we will build a quantitative numeric geochemical model (e.g., PHREEQC, Geochemist's Workbench, Humic Ion Binding Model) that can capture the cardinal controls over the benthic source.  Our goal is to provide a new interpretive framework for Nd and eNd, such that we can offer quantitative estimates of benthic fluxes for use in models of global circulation.  This work has potentially transformative implications on our understanding and application of REEs and Nd isotope data in both the modern and ancient oceans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project establishes a program to help prepare the next generation of leaders in genome sciences to be interdisciplinary researchers with experience in collaborative, international research. The program builds on strong existing ties between Duke University and four Berlin institutions led by Humboldt University, and on a history of productive collaboration between several of the faculty who will carry out the training. The centerpiece of the program involves 2-3 month-long visits by graduate students from Duke University to host lab groups in Berlin. The goal of these visits is to embed students in a lab group that provides exposure to complementary conceptual and technical approaches and, equally, to provide experience in working as part of a team-based, international research project. Funding for a complementary program on the German side was recently awarded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), providing a fully reciprocal exchange program. Students will not only benefit from the advantage of combined physical and human resources that this program provides, they will gain valuable methodological skills, domain expertise, and experience in critical thinking through a truly collaborative learning and research environment. Our long-term goal is to help them become future leaders in the ongoing transformation of biology into a quantitative discipline, with a long-term impact on how genomics affects numerous aspects of human life.<br/><br/>The program described in this proposal establishes an international collaboration between Duke University and four Berlin institutions (led by Humboldt University) that will offer U.S. graduate students an unparalleled opportunity to obtain a quantitative understanding of genome function and gene regulation within the context of biological systems through research within three complementary areas: (1) high-throughput genomics and editing, (2) bioinformatics and machine learning, and (3) developmental systems biology. Funding of this proposal will enable up to 12 graduate students from Duke University to engage in research at a partner institution over a three-year period. Participating students will travel to Berlin for approximately three months in order to engage in research under the mentorship of a host scientist. Students will obtain valuable international experience, significant training in methodology and critical thinking, and career-building experiences at the partner institution, thereby benefitting from expertise at both sites. Students will be co-advised by a dissertation committee including computational and biological experts from both sites. A tailored program will support the students in bridging the three emphasis areas identified above and acquiring important skills to prepare them for future careers at the cutting edge of academia and industry. Students will not only benefit from the advantage of combined physical and human resources, they will gain valuable methodological skills, domain expertise, and experience in critical thinking through a truly collaborative learning and research environment in order to become future leaders in the ongoing transformation of biology into a quantitative discipline, with a long-term impact on how genomics affects numerous aspects of human life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These risks are often highly localized and therefore avoidable. Many Americans depend on well water that often is below the standards set by regulatory actions pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. One approach to reduce contaminants is to rely on the government to mitigate these risks and reduce the welfare impact of adverse outcomes through the provision of local public goods, including safe drinking water and health services. Government provision of such public goods, however, is not always adequate. The assumptions underlying this project is that such limitations may be overcome by (a) exploiting private risk to achieve greater cooperation, building upon the ""veil of ignorance"" concept of John Rawls to foster cooperation for public goods; (b) departing from the pitfalls of either extreme of public or private goods only by focusing on sharing of privately-owned resources; and (c) exploring how information and social-networks increase cooperation as well as encouraging private investments in mitigation technologies. To test these concepts, the researchers have chosen as context a major disaster of natural origin: toxic levels of arsenic in groundwater pumped by millions of private wells across Bangladesh. Information on individual risk, in this case well tests for arsenic, are provided in ways that encourage greater cooperation and investment through the sharing of safe wells and the installation of new safe wells. The findings have implications for environmental policy in the United States as high-resolution data on water, air, and soil quality become increasingly accessible to citizens. <br/><br/>More specifically, this research studies the role of risk-sharing and social networks in perception and mitigation of local environmental risks. The research team focuses on two aspects: increasing cooperation for risk mitigation and increasing private investment in risk mitigation technology. This project is based in a setting where these two factors become particularly important due to a lack of government-provided resources for reducing environmental risk. The research first tests whether informal insurance, where compliance may be primarily enforced by existing social structure and reciprocity norms, can effectively counter the undersupply of local public goods. Then, the team studies how social-networks can help in increasing cooperation, adoption and investment in risk mitigation technology. To understand the channels, this project explores  how information on risk can facilitate more cooperation and risk mitigation. This relatively low-cost approach is different from the current approach of the government of Bangladesh which is focused on expensive infrastructure of limited reach. The study is a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, where the researchers randomly assign interventions on (a) ex-ante risk sharing, (b) information provision on risk, and (c) the demonstration of intermediate-depth wells which yield low arsenic. The original data allow the research team to test the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of mitigation efforts and reduction in arsenic exposure to the population. The experimental design allows for documentation of the causal impact of the interventions. The research team intends to share the results with policy makers and organizations so that lessons learnt here can be applied in similar settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The southern section of the SAF has not produced a major earthquake in historic times (over the last 300 years), and is currently believed to pose the largest seismic risk in California. This project will use new seismic and geodetic observations to investigate the sub-surface structure and geometry of the Southern San Andreas Fault (SSAF). In particular, the project will test a hypothesis that the SSAF may not be vertical and may substantial dip to the East. If confirmed, a non-vertical fault dip would have important implications for the mechanics and the long-term tectonic evolution of the SSAF. Better knowledge of the sub-surface geometry of the SSAF will also improve  predictions of seismic radiation patterns and the intensity of ground shaking due to future large earthquakes on the SSAF. The broader impacts of this work will be refined estimates of seismic hazard in densely populated areas in Southern California and Mexico as well as support for the education of two graduate students.<br/><br/>The researchers from this joint project between the University of California San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Southern California, will investigate the fault attitude at depth by imaging a low-rigidity damage zone and/or a bi-material interface associated with the SSAF in the upper crust. This will be accomplished by deploying a dense seismic array spanning the SSAF. Data from the deployed seismic array and regional seismic networks will be used to generate high-resolution tomographic images of the fault zone throughout the seismogenic layer. Seismic data will be combined with high-resolution geodetic observations, including Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). A joint analysis of seismic and geodetic data will provide new insights into the spatial extent and degree of damage around a mature plate boundary fault and enable comparisons with observations from other faults in California and elsewhere to examine how the distribution and amount of damage might depend on the fault age, seismic potential, and geometric complexity. The deployment of co-located dense seismic and geodetic arrays will establish a baseline for future measurements of possible time-dependent variations in mechanical properties of rocks comprising the fault zone due to external stress perturbations, which may help constrain the magnitude of absolute stress at seismogenic depth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2012, it was forecast that the US would need an additional 1 million STEM college graduates over a decade to remain globally competitive. Yet, the majority of students who enter college with intentions to major in a STEM discipline do not actually complete a STEM degree. Improving the retention of undergraduate students in STEM is thus a critical national priority. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) project will address this need by hosting the Research in Interdisciplinary STEM Education (RISE) program at Washington State University. Over the course of three years, RISE will immerse diverse cohorts of 10 undergraduate students each summer in authentic research focused on STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>While most undergraduate STEM education reform efforts have focused on teaching and learning at the undergraduate level, it is also important to understand the connections to K-12 and informal education settings, and to view STEM learning as a lifelong, life-wide phenomenon. The RISE scholars will advance STEM inclusion and diversity by investigating critical research questions related to STEM pathways, informal STEM education, and authentic STEM disciplinary practices. The RISE REU program will recruit undergraduate students from primarily non-PhD-granting institutions, with a particular focus on recruiting students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. RISE scholars will participate in extensive mentoring by faculty, graduate students, and peers; a series of professional skills workshops; and cohort-building activities to increase a sense of belonging and STEM identity. RISE participants will gain understandings of the importance of collaboration in STEM, the role of educational research in improving STEM education, and STEM career pathways. A comprehensive longitudinal evaluation plan will examine changes in the RISE scholars' understanding of, appreciation for, and pursuit of career possibilities in STEM and STEM education research. Ultimately, the REU RISE project is expected to contribute to a more vibrant and inclusive STEM workforce while advancing research in STEM education.<br/><br/>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in areas of research funded by NSF.

The complex nature of molecules, due to the fact that they can vibrate and rotate, combined with the exquisite control possible at low temperatures, provides access to new research directions in science and technology. Potential applications include tests of chemistry at extremely low temperatures, simulations of complex strongly interacting systems, and quantum computers that can leverage the laws of quantum mechanics to outperform classical computers. Almost all of these applications require controlled interactions between neighboring molecules and demand sample densities beyond the reach of current molecular cooling and trapping techniques. The research objectives of this program aim to trap many more molecules in a given volume relative to current cooling and trapping techniques and to readily detect and manipulate these interactions. These advances promise to accelerate both the development of low temperature molecules as a resource for quantum science and the emergence of new quantum technologies. In parallel to these research objectives, this CAREER award supports an educational effort designed to introduce key elements of quantum mechanics to high school students and the local community in Willimantic, CT. This ""Quantum Workshop"" will allow participants to demonstrate the wave- and particle-like nature of light for themselves through hands-on demonstrations and will expose users to the research performed within the Principal Investigator's lab. Each summer high school teachers will perform research within the Principal Investigator's group and then present their experiences to their students the following academic year. These activities are expected to increase both local interest in science and the number of students pursuing careers or a college education in physics and other STEM disciplines.  <br/><br/>Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. The extension of these techniques to molecules opens a wide range of research directions beyond the reach of atomic experiments. Examples of applications include time-resolved quantum simulations, ultracold organic chemistry, and new platforms for quantum computation and improved precision measurements. However, current limitations prevent the detection and manipulation of molecule-molecule interactions in laser-cooled samples, which are necessary for a growing list of applications. The key barrier is inefficient trap loading, which limits the densities achieved in molecular magneto-optical traps (MOTs). This program plans to remove this barrier and realize large, dense samples of ultracold molecules in two steps. The first step will substantially increase the number of trappable molecules produced in the MOT region. The second step will increase the MOT confining forces before cooling the trapped molecules to temperatures near 1K. In parallel to this research, the proposed work will develop an outreach program to partner with high schools and the local community in Willimantic, CT. This ""Quantum Workshop"" will leverage the research performed within the Principal Investigator's lab to present the world of quantum mechanics and wave-particle duality to high school students. As a part of this outreach effort, high school teachers will join the Principal Investigator's lab as summer technicians to broaden their scientific disciplinary knowledge and enhance the research performed within this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current archaeological evidence indicates that humans migrated from northeastern Asia into North America and spread throughout the rest of the Americas.  As part of this research theme, archaeologists are interested in learning about the timing and route that humans initially took to migrate into the Americas.  One main hypothesis on this theme asserts that people used a hunting-gathering-fishing lifeway to spread from northeastern Asia into North America and beyond by initially traveling along the Pacific coastline around the glaciated margins of Alaska and Canada.  If this is true, archaeologists expect that early coastal sites should contain artifacts and the remains of animals that reveal the application of effective technologies used to extract a living from a broad range of marine environmental resources.  Finding archaeological sites that show early North Americans peoples possessed a full mastery of marine environments would add confirmatory evidence to support the Pacific coastal migration hypothesis.

Understanding how such species adapt rapidly to new environments is key to preventing and managing invasions. Traditionally, the focus has been on inherent traits and flexibility of an invasive species, ignoring the potential for evolutionary change after introduction. However, recent research has shown that some marine species may evolve specific genomic features which allow highly efficient selection over as little as a single generation. This project tests the importance of genomic traits in allowing marine invasive species to survive and thrive on new shores. Its focus is on the high-impact invasive European green crab, which has spread over 1,500 km of the West Coast of North America since 1989 and has very recently begun expanding into the Salish Sea. This project tracks the earliest stages of green crab invasion into a new environment where the species is predicted to have substantial ecological and economic impacts. Genetic differences are followed over time and space across the entire West Coast, with a focus on crabs found in the Salish Sea where the species is currently expanding. Genetic data is complemented by oceanographic modeling to predict the spread of green crabs into the Salish Sea and across the West Coast. Finally, targeted sequencing and prior sampling are used to probe the genomic traits underlying these changes and determine if the same traits have played a role in the species' invasive success on other shores. Sampling for this project is conducted by Washington Sea Grant's Crab Team, an expansive outreach and monitoring program powered largely by hundreds of volunteers who monitor green crabs across 3,000 miles of coastline in the Salish Sea. The results of this project are shared with these volunteers and other stakeholders and is used to inform trans-boundary green crab management and spread prediction on the West Coast.<br/><br/>Recent work has hypothesized that genomic architecture, which has been increasingly discovered to play a role in local adaptation, may also be key to a species' ability to adapt quickly when gene flow is high. This project integrates multiple approaches to track the speed and dynamics of adaptation-with-gene flow across a thermal gradient in an explicit oceanographic context using the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas). Prior work in this system identified a suite of genes that appear to constitute balanced polymorphisms whose allele frequencies correlate strongly with site temperature against a homogeneous neutral genetic background. This project has three main goals: 1) To examine fine-scale selection to temperature over a comprehensive spatial and temporal data set comprising most of the species' history on the West Coast, 2) To track the expanding range front in the Salish Sea, comparing the genetic trajectory of individuals at the range edge with oceanographic modeling of dispersal, and 3) To characterize the genomic regions surrounding putative balanced polymorphisms and examine the ubiquity of their association with temperature across globally replicated populations. This coupled evolutionary oceanography approach represents an unprecedented test of the speed and nature of rapid adaptation in a highly dynamic natural marine environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, the funded project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from two Scandinavian nations, seeks to examine whether microbes on the skin and in the gut of wildlife have positive health benefits (i.e., fewer allergies, increased disease resistance, etc.) that are comparable to those discovered in humans with high endemic microbial diversity.  The work also seeks to determine how and/or if wildlife and their endemic microbiomes change under differently managed environments.  Boreal forest wildlife (moose and voles) were selected for study because ~80% of global terrestrial biodiversity is found in boreal forests and because these two species allow comparison between species inhabiting different habitats and interacting with different parts of the ecosystem. Samples will be taken from both species and examined for diverse measures of ""health"", such as internal and external microbial community diversity, parasite/pathogen infection, body condition, etc. Work will focus on quantifying the role microbes play (e.g., supplying energy, inducing or reducing inflammation, increasing or decreasing parasite/pathogen burden) in wildlife health and species response to environmental changes/conditions. It will also address how the microbiome of wildlife is impacted as a result of changes in biodiversity that is driven by changes in land use, different forest management practices, habitat, diet, etc.).  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between the US, Finland, and Sweden. Results will help provide better understanding of challenges in biodiversity conservation and the role of global change and forestry management practices on wildlife. The work is also likely to provide new avenues for improved ecological monitoring. In addition, this work provides important information from which to determine whether forest biodiversity impacts human health, via a potential increase in parasite burden due to decreased microbiome diversity in forest wildlife that may increase zoonotic disease risks for humans. Additional impacts include the integration of research and education and the training of students to be part of the new generation of international scholars.  The project also funds an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska).<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project will test the hypothesis: Environmental biodiversity has a positive effect on wildlife health. To test this, state-of-the-art genomics methods, molecular biology, and bioinformatics will be combined with data and measurements from forest community ecology, empirical data, and field experiments. Funds for US participants in the larger international consortium support the part of the larger study that focuses on Alaskan boreal forest moose that are exposed to both direct and indirect human impacts. Indirect impacts would include the increase in human fossil fuel consumption which is contributing to global warming. This warming contributes to increased fire intensity and frequency in Arctic and boreal ecosystems.  Direct impacts are when humans use fire as a tool to manage forest habitats to improve wildlife diversity and/or productivity.  Although in Alaska, burning generally increases the availability and diversity of woody deciduous browses for moose, it also results in juvenile stages of plant growth, reduces ground shading, and increases water stress in plants. This changes plant resource allocation patterns by increasing production of polyphenolics and other structural components. Thus, while fire may produce more browse and support higher densities of moose, their food may be of substantially lower nutritional quality, something that can reduce individual animal productivity and survivorship. The US component of this project addresses the impact of plant chemistry on the microbial composition and function of moose rumen to examine impacts on moose health and population productivity.  Microbiome samples of skin, nasal, and moose lower gastrointestinal tracts will be taken and analyzed to see if such impacts extend to other important microbiomes of the animals and to what extent these contribute to overall wildlife health. The hypothesis that browse diversity and nutritional quality influence moose diets will be tested by quantifying what moose eat, using fecal samples collected from the rectum of anesthetized wild moose and fresh fecal samples collected during field work associated with characterizing the diversity and abundance of foods available to moose in the study sites. Rumen contents of immobilized moose (ten individuals) in unburned and adjacent burned areas of two different moose ranges in interior and southcentral Alaska will also be analyzed.  Diets will be characterized using cuticular alkane/long-chain alcohol signatures of feces and foods as well as plant DNA metabarcoding methodologies.  Habitat food diversity and nutritional characteristics (digestibility, tannins, etc.) will be determined at each of the study sites through plotless surveys of plant diversity and abundance and via standard nutritional analytical procedures. This research will also test the hypothesis that moose diets influence the diversity and function of rumen microbial communities. Rumen and fecal microbiota will be taken and analyzed from each of the moose captured and sampled using high throughput DNA sequencing of 16s rDNA to test this hypothesis. In addition, the hypothesis that microbial community diversity of moose is negatively related to their parasite/pathogen loads will be tested by examining external and intestinal parasite loads of sampled individuals using standard protocols for parasites. These results will be compared using microbial diversity measures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also impacts the evolution of tectonic plates and the deformation of the hot mantle underneath, called the asthenosphere. In recent years, the continental United States has been blanketed by EarthScope's Transportable Array, a program that deployed thousands of seismic instruments. The collected data provide unprecedented new constraints on the structure of the uppermost mantle, informing its dynamics and history of formation and alteration. Here, the researchers analyze the data from the Colorado Plateau, an area with ancient Proterozoic crust. This area has remained relatively undeformed through multiple compression episodes and subsequent extension of the surrounding Basin and Range. The rise of the Plateau from near sea level to its current elevation is not well understood. The volcanism of the Basin and Range is now actively encroaching on the ancient Plateau.  By combining seismology and thermodynamic modeling, the team maps out the partial melt and alteration of the uppermost mantle.  This project brings new light on the past evolution and present state of an important region of the southwestern United States. It also supports an early-career female scientist, the principal investigator, and provides training to an undergraduate student in the field of seismology.<br/><br/>The team investigates the Colorado Plateau region, where disparate tectonic settings are juxtaposed within a small geographical area. The researchers use surface-wave dispersion data and information derived from S-to-P receiver functions about sharp velocity gradients in the upper mantle. They calculate accurate seismic-velocity models which employ a geologically reasonable layered framework. The models build on the Principal Investigator's previous work with receiver functions, which provides the layered lithosphere-asthenosphere framework in which to invert the dispersion data. The team combine seismic analysis with thermodynamic modeling in a self-consistent way to estimate regional velocity structures. The modeling accounts for the composition, pressure and temperature, as well as melt fraction at depth. These estimates are constrained by compositional and temperature data from the abundant volcanism and xenoliths in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, over the past 20 years, the United States has developed a growing negative trade imbalance in high-technology manufactured goods.  This gap inhibits both the growth of the economy and the rate of innovation, since it is difficult to innovate the next-generation of products when the current generation is not produced domestically.  A skilled manufacturing workforce is a prerequisite for successful global competition, but the US has lost its focus on preparing the technical workforce in recent decades.  New frameworks, pathways and partnerships for producing appropriately skilled workers are needed to protect America's economy and security.  Industry, academia, local economic development agencies, other non-governmental agencies, technical societies and federal agencies all have programs to address these problems, which are widely recognized.  There is a strong need to coordinate these stakeholders to develop evidence-based, actionable and replicable programs to train the next generation of manufacturing workers.  <br/><br/>The Manufacturing USA Institutes represent the largest investment in manufacturing technology development and workforce development in a generation. They are possibly the best leaders and conveners to set frameworks and programs for next-generation career technical education.  They are unique in that each is part of a national network that includes academic, federal and other stakeholders, while embedded in and highly-connected to the local economies in which they are located.  This creates a powerful opportunity to implement programs that serve local needs, while leveraging a national network of resources.  The workshop will bring together a team of experts to plan a series of workshops.  The planning team includes Manufacturing USA workforce directors, regional economic development advocates and academics who will define a strategy that positions the Institutes to be leaders and catalysts for a revitalized program for holistic workforce development ranging from K-12 education to professional development for incumbent workers. This overall program will close the gap between scientific discovery and impact on the US economy, including better jobs for workers.

Understanding the movement of heat and mass in the Earth's crust directly improves the understanding of other crustal systems such as geothermal systems, ore bodies, and geological hazards associated with volcanism. Multiple mineral phases with complementary strengths as geochronometers, together with multiple analytical techniques, will be used to produce a high-fidelity temperature (T)-time (t) record for the Alta-Little Cottonwood stock system, Utah, USA. In-situ microanalytical techniques will be used to place analytical results (mineral ages, chemistry) in textural and spatial context in order to connect these analytical results to the geologic processes responsible for the evolution of this magmatic-metamorphic system. The research outcomes could redefine our understanding of both the magmatic and metamorphic processes in these systems and in turn affect how we best utilize thermal and mineral resources and prepare for volcanic hazards. This project will strengthen research at a primarily undergraduate institution. In addition, a summer-school program will broaden participation in Earth Science and disseminate scientific content to middle school students in the context of the Utah Science Core curriculum. <br/><br/>The project will address fundamental questions of how incremental pluton emplacement and evolving permeability structures govern the temporal and spatial patterns of (hydro-) thermal metamorphism. Preliminary petrochronology results indicate that hydrothermal alteration of the Alta stock (AS), and possibly also growth of the contact aureole, occurred over ~10 Myr. This project will reconcile the small size of the AS with the large areal extent of its contact aureole (AA) and determine whether emplacement of the Little Cottonwood Stock (LCS) instead drove protracted, episodic hydrothermal and contact metamorphism in the adjacent AS and aureole. The researchers will apply in situ (LASS-ICP-MS) and high precision (CA-TIMS) U-Pb dating of titanite, zircon, and garnet in conjunction with thermal modeling to construct a robust T-t history of the system. They will test whether 1) the AS was a conduit for long-lived, episodic hydrothermal fluid-flow driven by emplacement of the LCS; 2) the hydrothermal system driven by emplacement of the LCS merely overprinted the western portion of the AS; or 3) a younger intrusion is responsible for the protracted hydrothermal systems in both stocks. The results of this project will impact our understanding of the transfer, storage, and crystallization of magmas, timescales of ore-body genesis, isotopic dating of major mineral phases, the timescales of contact metamorphic reactions, heat and mass transfer in orogens, and thermal modeling of magma and hydrothermal conduits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanomaterials also exhibit an ability to bypass biological barriers. These novel materials may elicit beneficial as well as undesirable responses depending on their composition, method of application, dose or the sensitivity of the crop species. There is limited understanding of how plants respond to these nanomaterials, how they take them up, and at what point the application results in undesirable effects. The project utilizes sensitive bio-analytical tools to study the response of plants to different doses of nanomaterials. The knowledge obtained from this study should serve to design safer nano-scale agrochemicals, improve their effectiveness and promote agricultural sustainability by reducing the use of active ingredients and undesirable accumulation of agrochemicals in soil and associated water bodies. The overarching goal of this research is to apply advanced analytical methods to understand   potential challenges in agriculture that can improve crop productivity and health, while minimizing burden on overall environmental health. <br/><br/>The proposed project will employ sensitive molecular ""nomics"" approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of uptake of metal oxide nanoparticles by crop plants and plant response at different doses. Multi-omic tools considered include high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics using advanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These tools will be used to probe the interactions at the protein and metabolite levels in plants exposed to metal oxide nanoparticles such as copper hydroxide, molybdenum oxide, manganese oxide and cerium oxide via foliar and soil application. Plasma-membrane proteins and apoplastic proteins are critical candidates for this study as they participate in communication between cells and the extracellular environment, ion transport, protein translocation/integration, and signal transduction. These protein in roots and leaves may be selectively enriched in the sample pool, helping to elucidate the main transport pathways. Analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites will also be fractionated for untargeted metabolomics. The candidate proteins and metabolites from untargeted -omic approach will be validated and quantified using targeted approaches across different exposure periods and concentrations, followed by meta-data integration to identify universal biomarkers of metal oxide nanoparticle exposure. The findings will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the routes of entry and localization of nanoparticles and simultaneous regulation of essential nutrients and plant metabolites. The results obtained will provide a benchmark for future research on targeted delivery of nutrients or other agrochemicals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In North America, the most populated region subject to significant volcanic hazards is the Pacific Northwest. Although the hazards associated with larger stratovolcanoes such as Mount St Helens and Mount Hood are reasonably well understood, a less studied type of volcano are the so call ""monogenetic"" centers, smaller volcanic cones that are widely distributed throughout the region. These typically consist of a small volcanic cone and associated lava fields. The amount of material erupted is typically less than a cubic kilometer total erupted volume, although larger examples also occur. However, within the Cascade Volcanic Range, there are thousands of this type of volcanic edifice. Their wide geographic distribution and overall short eruptive life span mean that the locations and effects of future eruptions are different to stratovolcanoes, and are more difficult to predict. Most monogenetic systems have not been studied in significant detail to predict future eruption behavior. This project seeks to gain greater understanding of the subsurface magmatic processes associated with monogenetic volcanism in the relatively populous Central Oregon region of the Cascades. In particular, the project will focus on the speed and style of magma movement through the volcanic edifice during eruptions, using a range of petrological and geochemical techniques. The project includes the training of a postdoctoral investigator.<br/><br/>The project will focus on a number of monogenetic centers in the Central Oregon area, including some related to Newberry Volcano (e.g. Lava Butte) and from the MacKenzie Pass area (Collier Cone, Little Belknap Crater). For the selected volcanoes zoned crystals, melt inclusions and melt embayments will be studied for diffusion chronometry of major elements, trace elements and volatile species analysis (CO2, H2O) to constrain the time between initiation of volcanic unrest and eruption to the surface. Magma ascent rates will also be calculated based on depth estimates from melt inclusions. The goal is to constrain the time between when a new eruption may be detected using remote means (typically seismic studies) and when actual eruptions might commence. Studies of melt inclusion and crystal compositions will also allow insight into the chemical and petrological complexity and structure of monogenetic magma plumbing systems. Overall the results of this work will significantly improve knowledge of subduction-related monogenetic volcanism and the hazard response required for these centers - a hitherto less well studied type of volcanism. Evaluating eruption style (effusive vs explosive) and ascent rates from volatile analysis, together with calculated diffusion chronometry timescales, will give new insight into monogenetic volcanism in a well characterized subduction zone system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasingly, the performance of computing systems is determined by the speed and energy efficiency of reading data from or writing it into the memory components of the system, rather than the speed with which logic operations can be performed. This trend is driving a paradigm shift of the semiconductor industry from logic-centric to memory-centric computing architectures, where storage and processing of data are closely integrated to increase computational efficiency.  This memory-centric computing paradigm puts new requirements on the memory devices in terms of speed, switching energy, endurance, and manufacturing processes.  However, present memory solutions do not scale adequately to address all of these demands and suffer from standby power dissipation due to leakage and/or refresh requirements.  This project is focused on the development of a new type of two-terminal magnetic memory device, referred to as antiferromagnetic voltage-controlled memory, to address the requirements of memory-centric computing applications.  In addition to its technical and scientific impact, the project will impact the education of students at undergraduate and graduate levels, including women and underrepresented minorities at Northwestern. The students will study, develop, and implement state-of-the-art nano-fabrication and high-speed measurements for emerging memory devices, working at the intersection of physics, material science, and electrical engineering.  Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, they will also take part in collaborations with industry and other departments at Northwestern and other universities. The project also leverages and contributes to on-going outreach efforts at Northwestern, engaging the general public in the advancement of science.<br/><br/>The proposed project incorporates two innovative elements in the device structure of magnetic random-access memory: (i) It uses metallic antiferromagnetic layers with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy for data storage. This is different from the conventionally used ferromagnetic free layers in existing magnetic memory, and provides a number of advantages: First, due to the zero overall magnetic moment of the antiferromagnet, the resulting device is robust against external magnetic fields, without any requirements for magnetic shielding.  Second, it eliminates bit-to-bit dipole interactions, which may result in scaling challenges and increased error rates in ferromagnetic memory arrays with tight pitch. Third, much faster switching can be achieved using antiferromagnetic resonance, which can have frequencies up to the Terahertz range due to the large built-in exchange field of the antiferromagnetic material.  (ii) Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy will be used for energy-efficient writing of data.  Specifically, a very short voltage pulse will be used to initiate the resonant dynamics and will be timed to result in a voltage-induced complete switching of the N?el vector. The switching occurs without the need for electric current, thus reducing write energy to reach the atto-Joule per bit range.  The voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect has previously only been demonstrated in the case of ferromagnetic devices.  Hence, its demonstration and utilization in the case of antiferromagnets is one of the key intellectual merits of the present proposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has created a market potential of $640.9 billion, which cannot be realized as existing networks operate at capacity. Despite this potential, only 8% of the radio spectrum is allocated to wireless communication technologies. This minimal allocation creates artificial scarcity of frequency resources, whereby popular bands are saturated, while others are under-utilized. In response, wireless technologies have begun to incorporate new hardware and software to boost their spectrum efficiency through opportunistic frequency reuse. While promising, this trajectory of innovation cannot be sustained unless we establish a framework for principled spectrum measurement and management that can embrace unforeseen network and sensor capabilities in support of future spectrum policy, policing and technology. This project develops a long-term, integrated program of research, education and outreach to (i) establish a scientific and technological framework for automated spectrum measurement in support of shared-spectrum access, and (ii) to train the next generation of wireless specialists at the intersection of networks, digital communications and machine learning. The project will work closely with industry and standardization efforts to ensure broader adoption.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out in three thrusts at the confluence of signal processing, digital communications, machine learning, graph mining, and large-scale measurement. First, it will study the effects of real-world scan imperfections on signal features. Following these insights, the project will contribute algorithms for spectrum cognizance and transmitter fingerprinting from imperfect scans. Second, it will enable application-driven measurement by creating an analytical framework that links sensor properties with data quality and algorithm performance. Third, models and algorithms will be integrated in an open system accessible to the community.

It will contribute data-driven and platform-aware abstractions, models and algorithms that produce domain-informed features for automatic spectrum analytics. The outcomes will bridge the existing gap between measurement capabilities and algorithm requirements while tackling realistic scenarios with rogue or incompletely scanned transmitters.

For example, the addition of halogens to fluids can cause minerals to break down at different temperatures and pressures, as well as, increase the ability of the fluid to transport of metals. Halogens are enriched in surface reservoirs (e.g., sedimentary pore fluids, sediments) compared to the Earth's mantle. The subduction of these reservoirs brings halogens into the mantle. Halogens can then be returned to the Earth's surface at arc volcanoes. However, mass balance constraints suggest that more halogens are subducted to the mantle than are returned to the Earth's surface via arc volcanism. These observations lead most researchers to suggest that an excess of halogens are being continually delivered to the mantle. This imbalance as implications for the long-term chemical evolution of the Earth's surficial reservoirs and mantle. However, several halogen reservoirs remain unquantified and may account for this disconnect. Here it is proposed that halogens may be sequestered in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (i.e., the upper mantle below the base of the continental crust) and thus not accounted for in calculations. By quantifying the concentrations of halogens in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, the overall halogen budget can be constrained. In addition to the intellectual impacts of improved understanding of elemental transfer through subductions zones, the broader impacts involve training of graduate and undergraduate students and participation in GeoFORCE, a summer program that engages outstanding students from select low performing minority-serving high schools in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This work will constrain the effects of subduction on the subcontinental lithospheric mantle halogen budget and the extent to which the subcontinental lithospheric mantle may act as a major halogen reservoir and control the overall halogen budget by ""isolating"" halogens from the subduction zone cycle for potentially long periods of time. This work will also provide insights as to how subduction processes modify the halogen concentrations and ratios in material returned to the convecting mantle. Bulk halogen concentrations, as well as, in situ halogen concentrations of hydrous (e.g., chlorite, amphibole, antigorite) and anhydrous minerals (e.g., pyroxene, olivine) of mantle xenoliths from the western United States that have been geochemically modified by the subducting Farallon slab will be measured. These data will be compared with other lithophile tracers of subduction input and melt depletion. The subduction-influenced xenoliths will be compared to non-subduction-modified mantle xenoliths and abyssal peridotites, which will serve as a baseline for halogen content in the convecting mantle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Focusing on a non-human primate model in which both father and mother provide care to their young, the researchers will study interactions between reproducing pair-bonded adults and solitary non-reproducing ones. This research will contribute to a better understanding of social relationships, including mating and parenting relationships, in pair-living, monogamous groups. The team will train nine undergraduate students, two Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral researcher from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. International collaborations with researchers in Argentina will be strengthened, and the investigators will expand efforts to foster the development of the biological anthropology discipline in Latin America. At the national level, outreach activities will include working with programs involving underrepresented minority high-school and undergraduate students in research (STARS program at the Yale Peabody Museum) and creating a public series of presentations based on their work for topics regularly covered in animal behavior and biological anthropology courses. <br/><br/>This research project occurs within the Owl Monkey Project of Argentina, an international research program to advance knowledge and theory about the evolution of pair-bonding, monogamy, and paternal care. In this new study, a team of researchers, undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs will collect demographic and genetic data from individuals in 60 groups of owl monkeys. The investigators will study solitary individuals who have left their natal group but have not yet pair-bonded, as well as pair-bonded adults. The solitary individuals need to enter a group to reproduce, which generates intense competition between solitary and pair-bonded adults. Data collected as part of this project will be used to evaluate how competition between solitary floaters and pair-bonded adults influences infant development and survival, natal dispersal patterns, pair-bond formation and stability, and mating patterns. In addition, because this primate species shows very little physical difference between males and females, but intense competition in both sexes, these data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of sex-specific morphologies and behaviors. The project will therefore make theoretical and empirical contributions to a number of concepts that are central to biological anthropology and evolutionary biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reason these features evolved is uncertain, however, they are thought to have helped the ancestors of apes and humans to search for food in trees. This project will examine ape locomotion in differing environments in the wild, including forests, woodlands and grasslands, and while feeding on a variety of foods, to determine the circumstances during which distinctive anatomical features are used while foraging. The findings of this study will help to determine why apes and humans evolved features such as an upright torso and mobile shoulders, arms and hands. This project will support the education of women and underrepresented groups at all levels of education - elementary through graduate school - through students' direct involvement in the creation of science education material. The outreach in this project creates cross-cultural connections and increases the quality of science education. Students in the U.S. and at the international research site will help create science education outreach materials and contribute research and conservation virtual content for a National Museum exhibit on ape and human evolution. Scientific findings will be shared through article publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at professional meetings.<br/><br/>Hominoids are distinguished by an upright torso and versatile locomotion. It is hypothesized that such versatility evolved to feed on ripe fruit in the forest canopy, since that is what living apes tend to do.  However, recent fossil discoveries show that the earliest apes to display advanced anatomical features, such as an upright torso, fed on leaves and fruit in a partially open environment. To determine how locomotor versatility relates to foraging behavior, the living ape with the broadest habitat preference, the chimpanzee, will be studied. The central question of this research is: How does variation in arboreal habitat structure, and variation in food type and location, correlate with arboreal positional behavior in woodland and forest chimpanzees?  This question will be addressed using video capture and observational data on chimpanzee positional behavior in different habitats. Linear models will be employed on observational data to explore the relationship between positional modes and contextual variables. Kinematic data will be extracted from limb excursions in video footage and analyzed to determine if positional performance is correlated with ecological and individual variables, and whether excursions are greatest for those behaviors that rely on the advanced anatomical features of interest.  Studying chimpanzee movement in multiple contexts and habitats will assist in predicting why hominoids evolved innovative positional behaviors and why early hominins transitioned to a less arboreal existence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Who people love often affects where they live and work, with whom they have and raise children, who they call friends and family, how they spend their time and money, who celebrates their successes, and who supports them in times of need. As a result, the quality of romantic relationships broadly affects physical health, mental health, and financial success. Understanding how people form and maintain these important relationships is central to understanding human social behavior. It is also a clear means of improving human health, happiness, and well being. Yet gaining a deeper understanding of the romantic partner choice process, and the role it plays in human welfare, is one of the great challenges of social and behavioral science. Romantic relationships develop within complex social environments. They are influenced by interactions between individual preferences, competition between romantic rivals, and mutual attractions that change over time. Accounting for such complex and intricate social systems requires assessing multiple, intertwined processes that are difficult to measure and observe. This project approaches the problem by developing a new computer simulation technique. The aim is to apply this technique to accelerate progress in basic understanding of romantic partner choice.<br/><br/>This new technique (""couple simulation"") compares theories of mate selection on their ability to reconstruct actual romantic relationships within computer simulations. Couple simulation will advance progress in mate choice research by providing the first empirical metrics for comparing different models of human mate selection. The method will help address questions such as: (1) what precisely are the decision processes that connect abstract, ideal preferences to real mate choices? (2) how do these early mate choice decisions relate to longer-term relationship quality and dissolution? (3) is it possible to identify those who are likely to have a fulfilling and supportive relationship? In preliminary studies, this technique identifies accurate models of romantic partner choice and predicts romantic relationship quality. This project will further develop couple simulation by combining agent-based modeling with studies of committed romantic couples, of change and stability in romantic relationships over time, and of the dynamics of initial relationship formation. The scientific aim is to produce computational models that more accurately describe romantic partner choice and that can more effectively aid people in forming fulfilling relationships. The project will also provide training in computational methods for a diverse group of early-career researchers, and it will contribute a novel, validated tool for relationship science to continue building on these successes into the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This arsenic is released from minerals within groundwater aquifers. People that regularly drink toxic levels of dissolved arsenic are at risk of getting deadly diseases. Some rocks and sediments contain enough arsenic to contaminate groundwater under certain conditions. This project aims to understand the conditions under which arsenic is trapped or released. One setting in which great quantities of arsenic is trapped is in riverbank sediments. Rivers continue to flow during dry periods by contributions from groundwater. Groundwater that has lots of iron and arsenic carries huge amounts of these elements to the riverbank sediments. It is important to understand the fate of this trapped arsenic and iron. The goal of this study is to develop a theory on the growth and fate of these iron-arsenic deposits. This project accomplishes this goal by observing which minerals the arsenic is bound to within sediments on the edge of the Meghna River in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has some of the highest naturally occurring levels of arsenic in aquifers in the world. Laboratory experiments will test the impact of tidal fluctuations on the nature of these iron-arsenic deposits. The movement of water and elements will be measured in the field between aquifers and the Meghna River. This project supports the research of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students and prepares the next generation of U.S. and Bangladeshi scientists to understand the movement of toxic elements between aquifers and rivers. <br/><br/>Arsenic-contaminated water resources are prevalent in fluvio-deltaic aquifers whose sediment are the geogenic source. The fate of As in groundwater discharging to rivers, however, remains unknown despite advances in understanding the origin and transport of As in groundwater. A few observations have suggested that As is stored within shallow, permeable, riverbank sediment through sorption on iron-oxide surfaces, referred to herein as Permeable Natural Reactive Barriers (PNRB). These accumulations threaten the communities along rivers should there be a reversal in groundwater flow induced by pumping, or should this high-As sediment be scoured and then re-deposited along a segment of the river where infiltration occurs. In deltaic regions, aquifers are connected to large rivers subject to periodic forcing driven by tides and seasonal flooding. Thus, the dynamics of groundwater-borne As transported to and from rivers should also be driven by similar periodic forcing. The amplitude and period of these fluctuations will uniquely determine the properties of these PNRBs, and knowing this, combined with knowledge of the iron (Fe) and As concentrations of the aquifers, should allow regional prediction of the accumulation of As in riverbank sediment. This project investigates the dynamics of a Fe-oxide PNRB through complementary detailed field characterization of sites along the Meghna River in Bangladesh along with laboratory experimentation and advanced coupled flow and reactive transport simulations. The data-driven modeling is used to assess the occurrence of PNRBs in similar tidal river-aquifer settings through sensitivity analysis. The anticipated findings will advance the understanding of the cycling of geogenic As in shallow, reducing alluvial aquifers connected with rivers in Asia. Critical knowledge on coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for the protection and management of water resources will be provided to both the local communities dealing with As contamination and the broader scientific body. Local stakeholders will be directly involved in the research and project findings will be translated for policy makers to reach affected communities. This study funds the research projects of undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral investigators and expands the infrastructure for studying groundwater-river water exchange along the Meghna River in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Sun, however, is much more complex, and it is therefore unclear whether models that work under ideal conditions resemble on the actual Sun.  The aim of this three-year research project is to test a popular model of solar eruptions, ""the standard 3D model,"" under realistic conditions by modeling real eruptions using photospheric observations to drive active-region-scale coronal MHD simulations.  The project team will devote a significant amount of time and effort to compare their numerical simulations to real solar observations.  The research study will have three parts: (i) perform data-driven MHD simulations; (ii) compare the simulations with observations; and, (iii) use the simulations to test predictions of ""the standard 3D model.""  For a sample of eruptive regions, the project team will construct nonlinear force-free extrapolations from vector magnetograms, about an hour before each eruption.  These extrapolations will be used to initialize the zero-beta MHD simulations driven by flow maps inferred from spectro-polarimetric data using optical-flow methods that treat the induction equation consistently.  The team will also model a set of non-eruptive regions as an important control: they will aim to demonstrate that their method does not produce eruptions when none occurs in reality.  They will use their simulations to test the predictions of ""the standard 3D model"" regarding the instability mechanism responsible for eruption (e.g., torus instability) and mode of reconnection during the eruption (e.g., slipping reconnection).  The inclusion of control regions will indicate whether or not these features are essential for an eruption to occur, and not just simply being present but remain unimportant during the eruption process.  The team will identify the instability mechanism, sites and nature of reconnection in their simulations.<br/><br/>To date, ""the standard 3D model"" of solar eruptions has been tested extensively using MHD simulations with simple bipolar magnetic fields.  This three-year research project takes the important next step to test the model under realistic conditions.  The intellectual merit of this work is to establish the viability of ""the standard 3D model.""  The project also aims to provide new physical insight into the basic mechanisms of magnetic energy storage and release in the solar atmosphere, which are important in a general astrophysical context.  A novel aspect of the research project is the significant amount of work devoted to validating the data-driven MHD simulations; although this type of simulations is becoming increasing common in recent years, their validation is typically of a secondary consideration and it often relies on by-eye comparisons between EUV loops and field lines from the simulation, for example.  The project team will devote a significant amount of time and effort to developing metrics for making quantitative comparisons between simulations and observations, which is a necessary step for objective validation.<br/><br/>The anticipated results of this three-year project will be of interest to the space weather community: an improved understanding of solar eruptions will also improve our predictive capability for these events.  The methodology and metrics for comparing numerical simulations to real observations that will be developed as part of this project will be of general use to the solar community; the project team will make their tools available to the broader community online.  All their project data will be made available to the public too.  The team also plans to organize a special session at the SHINE Workshop in the last year of the project focused on critically assessing the 3D standard model using different MHD models.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Field-based investigation is an integral part of the ongoing research programs at both national and international universities, largely in the STEM fields and in the earth sciences in particular. As a result, research teams and individuals are placed in a diverse set of field situations. Both organized studies and anecdotal reports suggest that a variety of harassment behaviors, whether sexual in nature or based on gender, race, ethnicity or ability, are a significant problem in field campaigns. A 2013 survey of field scientists from 32 disciplines from the science and social science arenas determined that these behaviors tend to be directed from the top of the power structure to more junior colleagues. A subsequent study on fieldwork experiences concluded that a lack of clarity regarding standards of conduct and rules for behavior in field research and training resulting in greater incidence of harassment. These studies also revealed that the majority of people experiencing harassment in the field did not know how or to whom to report, illustrating the need for clear guidelines. Here we propose to develop a field-team focused culture and risk management workshop program designed to foster skills and tools that will improve research ethics, create safer field working environments across demographics, and prevent future harassment.<br/><br/>II. The goal of this workshop proposal is to design, implement and evaluate a fieldwork-oriented culture building workshop program aimed at reducing harassment by promoting a respectful, equitable, and discrimination-free environment. This training will focus on the development of knowledge and interpersonal skills to prevent harassment and de-escalate situations in isolated field environments, including exercises designed to improve team culture and interpersonal communication and to foster shared experiences; the establishment of mutually-acceptable guidelines and standards appropriate to fieldwork for the specific subdiscipline, including codes of conduct; techniques to establish formal and informal support programs; and increased familiarity with field safety protocols, fieldwork hazards and emergency response planning and associated resources. To ensure that the program is relevant and impactful, it will include (1) a common core program that can be customized for different types of fieldwork and research activities; and (2) incorporation of active learning and scenario-based components. The training will address the needs of all participants, including team leader, team member and individual researcher.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.<br/><br/>The smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology."

The massive amounts of data provide incredible opportunities for making knowledge-based decisions and for advancing complicated research problems through data-driven discoveries. To capitalize on these opportunities, it is critical to develop methodology that facilitates the extraction of useful information from massive data in a computationally efficient way. Even the simplest analyses of the data can be computationally intensive or may no longer be feasible for big data. It is however often the case that valid conclusions can be drawn by considering only some of the data, referred to as subdata. This project develops optimal strategies for selecting subdata that retain, as much as possible, relevant information that was available in the massive data set. The methodology helps to identify the most informative data points, after which an analysis can proceed based on the selected subdata only. This facilitates data-driven decisions, scientific discoveries, and technological breakthroughs with computing resources that are readily available.<br/> <br/>Existing investigations for extracting information from big data with common computing power have focused on random subsampling-based approaches, which have as limitation that the amount of information extracted is only scalable to the subdata size, not the full data size. This project develops and expands the Information-Based Optimal Subdata Selection (IBOSS) method proposed by the PIs in the following directions: 1) It combines IBOSS with sparse variable selection methods in linear regression; 2) it develops subdata selection methods for generalized linear models; 3) it constructs computationally efficient algorithms for selecting the most informative subdata; and 4) it develops user-friendly software that supports the methodology.  The research is a significant addition to the field of big data science. It advances a new method for dealing with big data and has the potential to create novel research opportunities in statistical science and other quantitative fields. The results are valuable even when supercomputers are available, because cutting edge high performance computing facilities will always trail the exponential growth of data volume.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HVHF is a technique for producing oil and gas from shale formations that has revolutionized the domestic energy landscape. In the U.S., states are the primary regulators of oil and gas production, so there is variation in the types of and effectiveness of regulations in-use. Many of these regulations were enacted in the early-to-mid 1900s and were designed to manage conventional oil and gas production. Given the rapid expansion of HVHF across the country, this project asks whether these regulations are still appropriate, given the differences between conventional and HVHF production techniques. To answer this, the project first develops a cross-state database of regulations in-use to manage oil and gas production, which will be available online for the public, state regulators, journalists, and academics to explore how different states manage oil and gas production and how effective those regulations are. Second, the project engages landowners in focus groups to better understand the perspectives of people impacted, both positively and negatively, by the HVHF boom. Third, the project uses a series of laboratory economic experiments to advance scholarly understanding, in a controlled setting, of how different regulations incentivize individuals? decisions on whether to lease their oil and gas rights for production.<br/><br/>Scholars have long been interested in the linkages between governance institutions and the sustainability of common-pool resources (CPR), of which oil and gas are canonical examples. Institutions that facilitate efficient collective action are often seen as the best hope for a solution to the tragedy of the commons, and the long-endurance of institutions is often viewed as a best-case scenario. However, long-enduring institutions also lock participants in to a particular path that may or may not be efficient when exogenous changes occur. This project expands on the intellectual tradition of CPR scholars, by examining how a solution to a CPR dilemma today can exacerbate a different CPR dilemma tomorrow. The problem with such institutions is not necessarily the possibility of resource collapse (i.e. a tragedy of the commons), but rather of continued action in the face of substantially changed circumstances. CPR governance institutions can continue to be used to facilitate collective action, long after collective action ceases to be efficient or equitable for the group. Previously stable and efficient institutions may now have the effect of redistributing rents from those who are least vulnerable to the new risks introduced by an exogenous shock to those who are most vulnerable. This insight is a significant contribution to literature on institutions and decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, understanding how people use these multiple sources of information is fundamental to understanding and predicting choices.  Established approaches within psychology allow examination these processes in some situations. For example, to explore decision stages, a decision-maker may be asked to describe her thought process when making a choice, and that description is used to inform the researcher. In many situations, direct information about the choice processes is not accessible. For example, a decision maker may search her memory to find the information that could be used for choosing between options. When memory search is fast, people rarely have clear insight into how the memories were accessed and used. To allow for investigating decisions based on multiple sources of information across the widest range of situations, the principal investigators will integrate a powerful methodology based on mathematical cognitive modelling with standard decision-making research methodologies. The research will accomplish three objectives: (1) to gain an important understanding how multiple sources of information are combined during decision making, (2) conduct new empirical tests of the fundamental process across different decision making tasks, and (3) rigorously compare among the top decision making theories based on the new empirical findings.  These results will inform decision makers, allow assessment of decision making efficiency, and enable better models of choice behavior.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Over the years, several decision-making models were proposed that can account for many of the typical findings in human decision making, using both choice accuracy and response time output measures. However, no clear agreement about the underlying cognitive mechanism has been reached. These models can often be distinguished by strong implications about the processes that lead to a decision. Specifically, these models imply (a) how information is searched for, (b) when this information search is stopped, and (c) how the acquired information is integrated to reach the decision. Nonetheless, the disagreement remains.  In part this is due to model mimicking:  Without appropriate experimental design and analysis, different theories can make equivalent predictions. For example, inferences based on traditional mean response time (RT) analysis are limited due to model mimicking, as different decision-making models can imply exactly the same mean response time patterns. To overcome this limitation, we will integrate the powerful systems factorial technology (SFT) with traditional decision-making methods. SFT has been successfully applied in a wide range of perceptual and cognitive tasks to identify processing order, stopping rule and process dependency (a, b, and c from above), but has only been applied to decision making in very limited way.  Our research will link SFT to the classical methods in judgment and decision making to improve our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying decision making.  Our project will also contribute to improving the professional academic development of undergraduate and graduate students at two state universities that traditionally have fewer research opportunities for students.  All aspects of this research project, from methodology to theoretical development, will be communicated at national and international professional Furthermore, the research will be submitted for publication in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals.

Popular websites like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are built on top of data center applications that generate responses to incoming requests from end-users on the Internet.  In these applications, the work required to generate a response is distributed across a large number of servers (computers).  Unfortunately, these communication patterns lead to frequent events of data loss in the network.  Because data loss in the network must be recovered through retransmissions, it can dramatically increase communication latency (the time delay required for information to travel across a network).  This can ultimately translate into a loss of revenue for these companies.  Similarly, data loss is also a limiting factor on the adoption of new technologies like Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).  RDMA is important because it can reduce latency and increase throughput, and this can improve the performance of data center applications.  However, despite its benefits, RDMA is not seeing widespread adoption because RDMA Network Interface Cards (NICs) fail to perform well when there is data loss in the network.<br/><br/>The goal of our proposed research is twofold: 1) to reduce application latency, and 2) to enable important new technologies like RDMA.  This project will accomplish its goals through the design of a new flow control protocol, namely a protocol that prevents the network from dropping data.  The plan is to create a problem-free lossless network that does not drop data due to congestion and is also guaranteed to provide better or equal performance to an equivalent network that does drop data. Specifically, this project seeks to develop: new protocols for rapidly detecting and then communicating per-flow congestion information between switches and Network Interface Cards (NICs); novel algorithms for approximating per-flow queuing on currently available programmable networking hardware; and new techniques for building lossless overlay networks to support legacy devices.  The software from this project will be made broadly available for public reuse, and the researcher plans to integrate the proposed research into courses at the University of Illinois at Chicago.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this development, our understandings of social dynamics in local communities are based on research in urban centers. This project will examine the implications of diversifying suburbs for social integration, inequality, and inclusion. The project will address the following questions: What are the social dynamics in diverse suburbs? How do people in such contexts experience and think about social diversity, and what implications does this have for social inequality? This project will point to both challenges and opportunities of social inclusion in diverse suburbs and detail the ways in which inequality creation and maintenance occur differently in these spaces than in traditionally-studied urban contexts. Findings from the project will suggest what policies and practices will be most useful in creating and maintaining inclusive spaces and institutions in diverse suburban settings.<br/><br/>The project investigates residents' understandings of diversity in a diverse suburb and the community dynamics that result from these understandings. In-depth interviews with residents of a diverse suburb will assess how everyday experiences shape understandings of diversity and how, in turn, these individual understandings create community-level conversations, norms, and political arrangements that affect the extent to which suburbs are characterized by social inequality. The project uses qualitative analysis of three contexts: a socially diverse suburb; a diverse urban community; and a non-diverse suburban community located proximate to the diverse suburb.  Fieldwork will substantially focus on the diverse suburb and will include several strategies. The project will conduct approximately 115 in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of adult residents to gauge residents' experiences with and understandings of diversity and social inequality. In addition, interviews with local government, school district, and political officials will illuminate how diversity is addressed by local governments and school districts. The project also incorporates ethnographic observation of political campaigns, government events, and public life over a period of two years at this site. To evaluate these findings, the project will interview an additional 50 residents of the two additional sites.   Assessing how residents of these sites that vary in both diversity and urban/suburban designation understand diversity will permit comparative understanding of the social dynamics present in diverse, suburban contexts. The project will analyze the data using inductive, iterative coding in MAXQDA. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding inter-group relations, urban/suburban residence, and the dynamics of social inequality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the world continues to urbanize, convergent science, engineering and policy for urban systems is needed to ensure such transformative developments are, in fact, creating sustainable urban systems that benefit the citizens and societies at large. This requires both: (1) convergence of a variety of involved academic disciplines and practitioner expertise from city stakeholders; and (2) convergence of cyber-enabled technology systems at the human-infrastructure interface, creating a new system that can be referred to as a Smart City Digital Twin. With a vision of advancing understanding, development, and application of Smart City Digital Twins, this Smart City Digital Twin Convergence Conference aims to bring together experts from academia, industry, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations from large metropolitan areas in the United States to develop a convergent socio-technological framework for delivering smarter services through Smart City Digital Twins. The proposed Convergence Conference on Smart City Digital Twins also intends to create a community of thought leaders in this emerging area of inquiry. <br/><br/>This convergence conference will explore basic research occurring at the intersection of infrastructure systems, human systems, and technology systems. Smart City Digital Twins represent a new critical infrastructure transforming city operations and management. Existing knowledge on the requirements for single infrastructure Smart City Digital Twins will be shared as emerging testbeds in the areas of energy, built environment, water, and transportation are under development at Georgia Tech, Stanford University, Columbia University and the University of Illinois (Chicago). This sharing of knowledge will provide fundamental insights on multi-infrastructure interdependencies, as well as how human- infrastructure interactions can be sensed, analyzed, controlled, and visualized using cyber-infrastructure enabled technology such as Internet of Things (IoT). New knowledge will be created by engagement of interdisciplinary academic experts, industry practitioners, and government officials in workshop-style facilitated discussions to (1) develop a framework for comparing Smart City Digital Twin efforts and their stages of evolution and (2) chart a roadmap for future Smart City Digital Twin efforts that advance urban sustainability, resilience, and social well-being. Taken together, these convergence conference activities will provide a critical coalescing force as the new discipline of Smart City Digital Twins emerges. Smart City Digital Twinning efforts have the potential to transform the livability, sustainability, and resilience of cities, creating new business opportunities for companies of all sizes, new forms of citizen engagement by communities, creative forms of pedagogical practices, and new approaches to city operations and management by governments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All biomolecules found in living organisms have only one ""handedness', that is, the molecules exist only in one enantiomeric form. Moreover, different enantiomers of the same molecule can interact with living organisms in completely different ways, sometimes beneficially and sometimes with catastrophic effects.  As the wrong handedness can cause harm, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals must be synthesized in enantiopure forms. This synthesis may be accomplished by purification after the drug has been synthesized, but that approach is often difficult and cumbersome.  It is preferable to develop processes in which only one enantiomer of the drug is made. Enantiopure syntheses can be accomplished by using solid-phase catalysts with surfaces that are specifically modified to preferentially produce molecules with only one handedness. There have been a number of trial-and-error efforts to discover such heterogeneous catalysts, but success has so far been limited. Drs. Tysoe (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and Zaera (University of California-Riverside) have considerable experience in studying the surface chemistry of catalytic systems under ideal conditions.  Their research project focuses on understanding the molecular interactions that control enantio-selectivity in more complex and realistic systems for the advanced manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Drs. Tysoe and Zaera are strongly committed to educating women and minorities, in particular, Hispanic students both in the laboratory and through formal courses.  They participate in outreach programs at Milwaukee and Riverside, and are incorporating the research associated with this project into those activities.      <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Tysoe and Zaera are studying the surface chemistry of model palladium(111) and platinum(111) chiral catalysts modified by a cinchonidine analog, 1-(1-naphthyl) ethylamine (NEA), using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared absorption spectroscopy, reactivity measurements, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research provides a molecular-level understanding of the diastereomeric interactions between a number of prochiral reactants and NEA, and the forces that control them. They are investigating whether the detailed molecular understanding of the chiral surface chemistry from single-crystal studies in ultrahigh vacuum is relevant to the reaction pathways occurring under realistic conditions, that is, under atmospheric pressures and in the presence of a liquid phase. The resulting understanding may provide insights into how to improve catalytic selectivity.  The research may facilitate the targeted design of supported heterogeneous enantioselective catalysts. Such an ability is expected to have a significant economic impact in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Drs. Tysoe and Zaera focus on educating women and minorities through their research and outreach programs as part of the broader impacts of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Institutions that facilitate efficient collective action are often seen as the best hope for a solution to the tragedy of the commons, and the long endurance of institutions is often viewed as a best-case scenario. Long-enduring institutions, however, lock participants in to a particular path that may or may not be efficient when exogenous changes occur. This project expands on the intellectual tradition of CPR scholars by examining how a solution to a dilemma today can exacerbate a different CPR dilemma tomorrow. The problem with such institutions is not necessarily the possibility of resource collapse (i.e., a tragedy of the commons), but rather of continued action in the face of substantially changed circumstances. CPR governance institutions can continue to be used to facilitate collective action long after collective action ceases to be efficient or equitable for the group. Previously stable and efficient institutions may now have the effect of redistributing rents from those who are least vulnerable to the new risks introduced by an exogenous shock to those who are most vulnerable. This research examines the changing implications of oil and gas production and regulation in the United States. <br/><br/>How effective are existing regulations at managing the risks from high volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF), commonly known as ""fracking?"" HVHF is a technique for producing oil and gas from shale formations that has revolutionized the domestic energy landscape. In the U.S., states are the primary regulators of oil and gas production, so there is variation in the types of and effectiveness of regulations in-use. Many of these regulations were enacted in the early-to-mid 1900s and were designed to manage conventional oil and gas production. Given the rapid expansion of HVHF across the country, this research explores the effects of these regulations and HVHF production techniques. The project first develops a cross-state database of current regulations used to manage oil and gas production, which will be available online for the public, state regulators, journalists, and academics to explore how different states manage oil and gas production and how effective those regulations are. Second, the project engages landowners in focus groups to better understand the perspectives of people impacted, both positively and negatively, by the HVHF boom. Third, the project uses a series of laboratory economic experiments to advance scholarly understanding, in a controlled setting, of how different regulations incentivize individual decisions whether to sign leases to allow oil and gas production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a brainstorming effort, it is intended to gather together activities underway around the Basin that relate to sustainable urban water systems, to bring fresh perspectives, to spur the development of new solutions, and to build a network of knowledge and perspective sharing that can both advance practice and bring cutting-edge current practice to the classroom. The participant group assembled will include researchers, government and other stakeholder representatives, and practitioners. The long-term goal will be to drive practice forward through scientific, engineering, policy, and design research, all informed by the insights of practice. To do this effectively necessarily means creating linkages that cross technical, jurisdictional, regulatory and cultural boundaries. This also means reaching across disciplinary boundaries to develop a common language and shared set of research objectives. The workshop will take as its illustrative focus the urban land/water interface and the challenges of linking aquatic habitat restoration with green infrastructure. Successfully linking these two systems offers the potential to expand both their efficacy and range of applicability. Together, these systems not only address specific environmental challenges, they create urban ecosystems that foster public health and environmental education. <br/><br/>The conferees will include three broad groups, drawn from the Great Lakes Basin and beyond: (1) Academic researchers in freshwater sciences, engineering, public policy, the humanities, urban planning, urban design, architecture and landscape architecture; (2) Local, state and federal government, utility and other stakeholder representatives; (3) Professional design team members, including designers, engineers, and ecologists. As one facet of urban water systems sustainability, returning native ecologies to urban environments serves a profound human need for association with living systems. Such interventions serve broad social goals by both moving towards sustainability and by creating tangible symbols of that goal. To achieve this objective, discussion at this workshop will test a conceptual model that posits that urban water systems should mimic natural ecological systems in evolving towards ever greater complexities of cascading linkages.

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from Fennoscandinavian nations, seeks to use birds as bioindicators of environmental health on large scales such as changes to farming or forestry practices and on smaller scales such as environmental recovery from localized severe weather or pollution events. This choice of indicator is because birds are valuable indicators of environmental conditions because they are ubiquitous in most environments, with different species having different food and habitat requirements. Thus, birds, as a group, sample environments in different ways during the process of acquiring food which can range from small organisms, such as plankton, to animals larger than rabbits, depending on the species of bird and its evolved food requirements.  Additionally, when environmental conditions make food scarce, most species of birds simply fly away and seek more conducive environs. As a result, the response of birds to changing conditions can be far more rapid than the responses of less mobile organisms.  Birds are also typically visually and vocally obvious and there are bird-watching hobbyists (i.e. citizen scientists) across the globe who observe and record the birds they see throughout the year and what those birds are doing.  Thus, large amounts of data exist from which we can learn about the environmental conditions preferred by a large number of species of birds.  Project goals are to: (1) create methods for identifying a set of bird species that are good indicators of environmental conditions in habitats such as alpine/arctic tundra, highly managed and natural forests, and farmland and (2) use this information to anticipate changes in physical conditions (e.g., weather) and those caused by people (e.g., land use and farming practices).  Broader impacts of this research include international collaboration scientists in Norway, Sweden, and Finland and the use of citizen science and the collection of data by the birdwatching public. Impacts also include those that are societal and economic in terms of the relation of study results to achieving sustainable harvests and fisheries. Other impacts include development of a planning tool for minimizing losses of key ecosystem services from birds in forest regeneration, pest management, and sustainable harvests that can be used by resource managers. Results of the study will be valuable for the development of science-based policies where avian species play a role.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project will address knowledge gaps on the links between biodiversity and habitat alteration using birds as indicator species. Project objectives are to improve methods for predicting the responses of birds to changes in their environments. Instead of merely looking at correlations between where species live and features of the environments they inhabit or travel though, this work examine the causal associations between birds and their environments by looking at functional traits (i.e., those that lead birds to respond to changes in their environment).  To accomplish this, the project makes use of year-round data from a large geographic area, i.e., Europe, to track migratory bird species and their habitat associations in their summer and winter ranges and along their migratory routes to determine when and where responses to environmental change are strongest, thus improving our ability to accurately forecast responses to environmental changes. This is a ""whole-life-cycle"" approach to assessing population health and is only now being explored by ecological researchers. The US component of the project focuses on developing computationally intensive machine-learning methods by investigators who have extensive expertise in working with very large citizen science data sets. The parts of the project carried out by scientists from other countries will be funded by those countries. This work will, in addition to anticipating consequences of physical conditions and anthropogenic land-use practices across Europe, aid in the development of new conservation strategies in response to environmental change, for example by identifying needs or opportunities to change the areas targeted for management actions such as habitat protection or restoration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, people often abandon their own personal judgments and choices in favor of conforming to a group majority. In some cases, such alignment with the group may protect against social rejection and grant access to shared resources. However, research has shown that people also conform even when there is no social or economic gain for them. One explanation for this result is that the act of reaching consensus with one's group might be valuable in itself -- an idea that is supported by recent neuroscientific research showing that the brain's reward circuit is involved in social conformity. This project combines computational cognitive modeling with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral economic procedures to better understand the subjective value of conforming and dissenting decisions. By uncovering the motivating and reinforcing properties of majority alignment, this research will shed light on a fundamental aspect of organizational, professional and personal interactions. Among the broader impacts is a priority to share data and code to benefit research in cognitive and social neuroscience, to involve the participation of women, underrepresented groups and high school students, and to inform the development of tools that can improve the social competency of impaired individuals.<br/><br/>This project uses model-based cognitive neuroscience to investigate the motivating and reinforcing properties of social conformity. The main approach is to make the desire to conform compete with the prospect of economic gain, and to assess the transfer of conformity-based valence to other features of the environment. A second objective is to investigate how the relative size and perceived competence of a majority opinion influences the value associated with consensus and dissent. A third objective is to explore a common neural representation for conformity and conventional reward.  All of the studies use variations of standard tasks employed in research on economic decision-making. Reinforcement learning models are used to make quantitative predictions about behavioral choices and neural activity.  Model-based fMRI analyses are combined with connectivity and multi-voxel pattern analyses to investigate interactions between social and motivational neural networks, and to explore a distributed overlapping neural code for social and economic currencies.  By formalizing consensus-seeking behavior as reinforcement learning, the project contributes in several ways to the behavioral and neuroscientific literatures on social conformity. In particular, the reinforcement learning framework provides a mechanism for how apparently inconsequential consensus decisions may be motivated by previously acquired valence, and for how that valence may then be transferred to other contextual and interpersonal features. This approach bridges a critical gap, at both neural and behavioral levels, between complex socio-cognitive representations and basic mechanisms of reward-based learning and decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By interfacing the biology of the human nose with a read-out platform, it will be possible to decode the human sense of smell and open up new possibilities. Such a nose-on-a-chip and its associated smell database has multiple commercial applications in the fragrance and flavor industry including increasing the efficiency of developing aroma chemicals for food, personal hygiene or household use, and fine perfumes.  Also, it may be possible to identify specific malodor receptors and developing compounds that block repulsive odors or modulate olfaction (boost smell capacity and/or suppress odor cravings). In addition, the smell database can be employed to develop algorithms that predict how new aroma chemicals will smell before making them. There is an additional opportunity for the nose-on-a-chip in the healthcare industry when applied to sniff out disease-associated odors, such as Parkinson's disease. Odor-based disease detection may revolutionize biomarker discovery and may have a significant impact on R&D spending in the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately decrease treatment cost for patients.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to produce an odor-specific nose-on-a-chip assay containing a subset of odorant receptors that can report the presence of a specific odor (odor MS1) and its derivatives. This minimal viable platform is based on a well-validated need in the fragrance and flavor industry and needs to demonstrate sensitivity, specificity, selectivity and intensity (S3I) of odor activation.  The goals are to identify a set of high-affinity odor MS1 receptors, generate engineered mice for each receptor through this validated platform technology and demonstrate S3I using an established ex vivo bio-assay. Engineered mice form the basis of the proposed commercial platform. They are the bioreactors producing the olfactory extracts that are used in the ex vivo bioassay and, ultimately, are integrated with a silicon chip.  As such, optimized generation of mice is key to cost-efficient scaling of the proposed commercial chips and is a primary objective of the project. The plan is to develop a high-throughput method of generating any receptor in mice. Then, the goal is to develop an optimized gene-targeted line that will serve as a standardized template for future knock-ins of any odorant receptor gene, providing a streamlined, standardized and scalable method to ultimately establish the complete library.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While food waste has been studied in the scientific literature, primarily from the technical perspective, much of the existing research is fragmented across single disciplines and disconnected case studies. Modeling, managing, assessing, and replicating sustainable urban food waste solutions will require novel research approaches, organized under the principle of convergence, which deeply integrates knowledge and methods from different disciplines, and carried out through meaningful collaborations between scientific researchers and stakeholders embedded in the food supply chain. This SUS workshop is targeted to catalyze these collaborations, provide a platform of exchanging knowledge across fields, and establish a sustainable urban systems research agenda organized around the specific and compelling problem of minimizing and managing food waste for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. A key aspect is the planned approach to capturing geographic heterogeneity in urban food waste systems and solutions, by structuring the workshop scope to consider both aggregate impact of multiple urban areas in a single state and comparative analysis of cities across the U.S. <br/><br/>Efficient, resilient, and robust food supply chains are a critical part of sustainable urban systems. Knowledge created by convergent research networks can inform design of resource-efficient technologies, policies, and social interventions to minimize food waste and attendant energy, water, and resource use in cities and the peri-urban and rural regions on which they rely. Research catalyzed by this workshop is expected to generate new models of multi-scale transboundary interactions and innovative solutions for urban food waste challenges. These findings have potential for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit, and will be broadly disseminated to both scientific and stakeholder audiences. The workshop is anticipated to lead to greater understanding of how SUS science can be communicated effectively to help individuals, communities, and businesses take action to reduce their contribution to food waste. The workshop will also provide attendees with new understanding and approaches to engage traditionally underrepresented groups, particularly deaf/hard of hearing learners and scientists, in research leading to discovery and innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FACM 2019 is focused on mathematical and applications challenges related to systems involving particles in fluids, broadly interpreted. This topic is motivated by the significant recent progress that has been made in areas of discrete and continuum modeling of such systems, as well as in related fields within physics, biology, and the engineering disciplines. These systems are of relevance to a number of applications including materials science, energy applications, as well as health and medicine.  We also envision a significant focus on high-performance computing which is integral part of the research in this field. The conference, which is this year carried out jointly with the 11th Northeast Complex Fluids and Soft Matter Workshop, will include mini-symposia on applications of networks and computational topology to granular systems, as well as on suspensions, active matter, and related materials science systems. The conference will bring together mathematicians, scientists and engineers, with significant participation of junior researchers. More information can be found on the conference website http://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM19/.<br/><br/>The FACM conference series has been organized over the past fifteen years by the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at NJIT. The annual meeting is a forum for the dissemination of research in applied and computational mathematics and statistics.

This project tests the idea that decision makers are more accepting of risk when they perceive that they have control over the level of risk they experience. The role of autonomy may explain why decision makers choose a small likelihood of a large outcome over a small certain alternative even though the small certain outcome is more motivating than the uncertain amount as a reward for performing an effortful task. The research findings have implications for understanding when decision makers are most willing to take on risk and for how best to incentivize performance tasks.<br/><br/>Decisions under risk are ubiquitous in everyday life. In some risky situations decision makers have autonomy over the risk level they experience while in others decision makers respond to an assigned risk present in the environment. This research project tests the hypothesis that autonomy increases risk tolerance such that decision makers will exhibit more risk-seeking preferences when they can choose an option than when they respond to an assigned risk. One set of studies tests the prediction that autonomy, or even just the perception of control, increases risk tolerance. That is, decision makers are predicted to have a stronger preference for risky alternatives if they perceive that they have control over the risk level they experience, even when the objective risk level is held constant between decision makers who do and do not have autonomy. A second set of studies applies the effects of autonomy to why decision makers tend to choose low probability lotteries over matched certain outcomes whereas similar lotteries do not serve as effective incentives for effort tasks relative to certain incentives. The researchers compare risk preferences revealed in choice tasks to those revealed in effort tasks with real incentives, they seek to isolate the task features responsible for the difference in risk preference, and they test whether differences in perceived autonomy can explain why decision makers will choose risky options but not work for them. Ten laboratory experiments and two field studies test the predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Presently, there are major problems associated with the collection, integration, and visualization of subsurface data.  These cross the spectrum from (1) cultural and legal issues, with respect to who owns that data and who is liable, if it is not correct, to (2) security concerns, to (3) the highly technical issues involved in having fully compatible data types and data systems that can accommodate intensely varied data related to natural geology and hydrology, as well as that of constructed infrastructure.  Without such data resources, the next generation of urban infrastructure will not benefit from the wide range of emerging technologies that have the potential to make American cities safer, more affordable, and more resilient to natural and manmade disasters.  To this end, this award will pair a wide range of scientists and engineers from academe and industry with governmental officials, big data specialists, data standards organizations, and community groups for a two-day workshop in New York City to help give voice to the individual needs of each of these groups of stakeholder.  The first day will be open to the public and will accommodate as many as 200 participants including local area veterans and students from underserved communities.  The second day will focus on crafting a document to promote a common understanding of the problems and challenges surrounding comprehensive subsurface documentation of America's cities.  Both an artist and a science writer have been engaged to create dissemination vehicles that will help ensure that the workshop's outcomes will be fully understandable to the general public.<br/><br/>Urban subsurfaces are hotly contested spaces essential for the majority of urban system infrastructure including water, sewer, gas, steam, electric, telecommunications, and transit (road and rail), as well as hosting building foundations, basements, and parking garages.  Yet, the subsurface is not only under-documented, but what documentation exists is typically held in siloed systems and populated by incompatible or non-computer readable data.  This phenomenon of poor data documentation and integration in the intensively used subsurface represents a significant barrier to creating truly sustainable urban systems (SUS), both because these ""invisible"" assets are vulnerable to floods, subsidence, digging accidents, and failures of degradation and neglect and because the subsurface environment is not zoned akin to aboveground spaces.  Pioneering new SUSs solutions will require a full appreciation of both existing systems and their surrounding constraints - built and natural.  This demands achieving seamless, interoperable, three-dimensional data storage, visualization, and asset management systems.  While not market ready, such technology does exist, though not in the form of a Building Information Model (BIM) approach, which is typically used for individual structures, or in the form of CityGML (commonly used for aboveground, city-scale representation).  In fact, not only is there is not a widely agreed upon or even dominant approach for documenting the subsurface, there are now more than two dozen related (and arguably competing) initiatives. Some consider only constructed objects such as gas utilities.  Others include only geological or hydrological factors. Some are strongly focused on compatibility with existing standards and undertakings, while others cover only application-specific support for a single industry or legacy system.  Ultimately, if there are to be fundamental advances in the design and long-term stewardship of SUS, as well as a larger understanding of the development, zoning, and management of subsurface urban spaces, including the emerging area of geothermal heat pump systems, such piecemeal approaches to documentation and data access will have to be overcome.  This includes addressing real concerns about both security and liability, as many of the barriers are based in policy and precedence.  Importantly, to date there has not been a forum in which US-based engineering organizations, designers, and contractors interface with the asset stakeholders, stewards, and first responders.  The DIG Around workshop will be the first such event to facilitate this dialogue.  The two-day workshop begins with a full day event open to the public and concludes with a day-long opportunity for experts in the field and leading stakeholders to draft strategies and recommendations for transforming the disparate state of play into a more cohesive vision.  As part of this (1) areas of alignment and gaps in existing subsurface data management paradigms and standards will be identified; (2) a broader understanding of the challenges and opportunities (scientific, technological, and policy-based) for effective subsurface data sharing will be forged; and (3) critical scientific gaps in the support of developing new SUS will be identified with input from an unprecedented diversity of stakeholders from first responders, critical governmental agencies, profession standards organization, domain-based professional societies, community organizations, utility companies, and researchers.  Community accessible workshop outcomes will be developed by a writer and artist in order to help urban stakeholders at all levels of engagement and expertise to understand this crucial issue.  Finally, this workshop will provide the first forum for leaders in the geotechnical community representing the Geo-institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the DIGGS effort, and other undertakings to formally interface with other organizations developing relevant standards (e.g. Open Geospatial Consortium).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The annual MVAPICH User Group (MUG) meeting provides an open forum to exchange information on the design and usage of MVAPICH2 libraries, which are open-source, high-performance and scalable MPI libraries to take advantage of RDMA technology. Travel funding from this project will enable a set of undergraduate and graduate students to attend the MUG meeting. Their participation will help them to enter the next-generation HPC workforce with increased expertise in software design, reuse, and sustainability.  The project, thus, serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense. <br/><br/>The MVAPICH project focuses on the design of high-performance MPI and PGAS runtimes for HPC systems. Over the years, this project has been able to incorporate new designs to leverage novel multi-/many-core platforms like Intel Xeons, NVIDIA GPGPUs, Open POWER, and ARM architectures, coupled with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enabled commodity networking technologies like InfiniBand, RoCE, Omni-Path, and iWARP. An annual MVAPICH User Group (MUG) meeting was created six years ago to provide an open forum to exchange information on MVAPICH2 libraries. The funding under this grant aims to achieve increased participation of undergraduate and graduate students working in the HPC area (systems and applications) in the annual MUG event. The requested student travel fund helps attract a set of students from a range of US institutions. Participation in an international event, such as MUG, enables students to obtain global picture of the developments happening in the rapidly evolving HPC domain and open-source software design. The selection committee plans to stress diversity to attract students from minority and under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This lack of racial and ethnic diversity hampers the creation of a diversified STEM workforce and also lead to lack of diversity in research topics in economics. Broadening Participation in STEM Faculty: A Program to Support the Diversity Initiative for Tenure in Economics (DITE) is a program to  support under-represented junior faculty in economics. The broad goal of the program is to increase the number of faculty from under-represented populations in economics who hold tenured positions in the academy generally. The project will also focus on increasing tenured faculty in economics at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Colleges and Universities (HSCUs). DITE fellows will be mentored by distinguished professors of economics in integrating research projects, establishing a credible research portfolio and publishing and service record that will get them tenured in economic departments.  DITE will support a yearly cohort of 15 junior economics faculty over the two-year span of this proposed grant (for a cumulative total of up to 30).  DITE fellows who obtain tenure are expected to mentor your economic faculty of color.  By helping to diversify the economics faculty in the US, the proposed activity will help to create a diversified STEM workforce and research agenda for the 21st century, thus strengthening the US economy. <br/><br/>Broadening Participation in STEM Faculty:  Broadening Participation in STEM Faculty: A Program to Support the Diversity Initiative for Tenure in Economics (DITE) is a program to  support under-represented junior faculty in the economics profession.  The continued gross under-representation of economists from racial minorities and ethnic groups in the ranks of college and university faculty creates an imperative for special efforts to change the STEM field and the academy through increased presence of under-represented groups (URM). Serious under-representation does not only inhibit US?s ability to create a diversified STEM workforce for the 21st century and beyond, it also skews economic research away from issues that may concern to these under-represented groups.  Because there are so few URM professors of economics, there is a greater cost to society when any single one of these professors is lost in the tenure pipeline. The DITE curriculum is designed to help URM faculty of economics decode the academy, demystify the promotion and tenure process, and identify, develop, and leverage a research program to a tenure position.  The DITE program will therefore benefit the US through a diversified economics faculty and an enhanced research portfolio.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ontologies have been widely used for orchestrating the coding, management, exchange, and sharing of the increasingly large amounts of digital data produced by the biomedical research enterprise. For example, SNOMED CT, one of the largest and most complex biomedical ontologies, supports the development of high-quality electronic health records and facilitates patient subgroup identification, clinical decision support, and healthcare delivery quality measurement. Given such important roles that biomedical ontologies play, quality issues (such as incompleteness in coverage of subclasses), if not addressed, can affect the quality of diagnoses and decisions. However, incompleteness issues such as missing hierarchical relations and missing concepts are infeasible to be addressed by manual work alone due to the size and complexity of biomedical ontologies. The goal of this project is to develop automated and scalable approaches for identifying potential incompleteness issues as well as suggesting solutions to fix them. This project will incorporate the computational aspects of the proposed work into curriculum development and educational offerings related to data science and promote women participation in data science.<br/><br/>To audit and enhance completeness of ontologies, this project explores the following research tasks: (1) Development of a robust reasoning framework for detecting and repairing missing subclass or hierarchical relations. This will result in suggestions that directly enhances the subclass completeness of ontologies; (2) Development of novel methods for identifying missing concepts and creating appropriate name labels for the identified missing concepts. This will result in enhancement in the concept completeness of ontologies; (3) Generation of supporting evidence for suggested solutions by leveraging rich extrinsic knowledge. For further verification of the robustness of the proposed approaches, domain experts will be involved in validation of the discovered incompleteness issues. The proposed approaches are applied to three large ontologies in biomedicine: SNOMED CT, Gene Ontology, and NCI Thesaurus. Suggested ontology changes will be communicated to the respective ontology owners for incorporation in subsequent versions. The project website will include further information about this project, and provide access to publications, software, datasets and curriculum material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People develop and maintain a unique set of personal memories and personality traits that define the essence of who they are.  Important lines of psychological theory and research have shown that self-knowledge is distinct from other forms of knowledge.  As an example, self-knowledge is more deeply and tightly stored in memory than other forms of knowledge.  At the same time, it is known that self-knowledge is not rigid or fixed in memory; like other forms of knowledge, it can be malleable and change over time.  An important focus of past research has considered the conditions under which a person's self-knowledge might change.  This project focuses on one such potential condition: the act of thinking about or simulating other people.  This focus recognizes that one's sense of self develops in and is influenced by social life.  A child's sense of self develops partly as a result of imaginary companions and learning how to take the perspective of others.  Comparing ourselves to others is also known to have a strong influence on one's own sense of self.  This project integrates insights from basic memory research, social psychology, and neuroscience to gain insight into how it is that simulating other minds changes the content of self-knowledge.  Because one's self-concept can be a powerful predictor of behaviors and life outcomes, this research offers important practical implications.  One such application concerns the barriers to female participation and advancement in STEM education and occupations.  Relative to their male counterparts, females see fewer successful role models (others) who are ""like them.""  As a result, females have fewer opportunities to accumulate self-knowledge that encourages the valuing and pursuit of a career in STEM.  This project offers a novel solution -- simulating successful others -- that may help diminish this barrier.<br/><br/>The hypothesis that imagination can change self-knowledge derives naturally from two well-established research literatures.  Social cognition research has found that people retrieve self-knowledge when imagining, or ""simulating,"" how another person is thinking or feeling.  Memory research has found that when information is retrieved, it enters a labile state and can be contaminated with newly presented information.  Together, these two lines of research suggest that when simulating another person, retrieved self-knowledge may become temporarily labile.  In this state, self-knowledge may blend together with information about the other person.  As a result of simulation, self-knowledge may then incorporate information about the person one is simulating.  The outcome is a change in the self to become more similar to the other.  This phenomenon is Simulation-Induced Malleability (SIM).  Preliminary studies offer evidence for SIM: people's personal episodic memories, personality traits, and physical traits become more similar to how they imagined another person's experiences and traits, and these changes are long-lasting.  This project leverages diverse approaches to test specific predictions regarding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie how SIM changes the self.  It also considers the consequences and social applications of SIM.  The research integrates insights from online, in-lab, and longitudinal behavioral methods, along with advanced multivariate neuroimaging techniques, to develop a comprehensive assessment of Simulation-Induced Malleability.  It will inform the longstanding and widespread problem of gender disparities in STEM fields, thereby helping to advance the science of broadening participation.  Open source data and analysis tools will be shared with research communities in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to facilitate applications and future research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All biomolecules found in living organisms have only one ""handedness', that is, the molecules exist only in one enantiomeric form. Moreover, different enantiomers of the same molecule can interact with living organisms in completely different ways, sometimes beneficially and sometimes with catastrophic effects.  As the wrong handedness can cause harm, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals must be synthesized in enantiopure forms. This synthesis may be accomplished by purification after the drug has been synthesized, but that approach is often difficult and cumbersome.  It is preferable to develop processes in which only one enantiomer of the drug is made. Enantiopure syntheses can be accomplished by using solid-phase catalysts with surfaces that are specifically modified to preferentially produce molecules with only one handedness. There have been a number of trial-and-error efforts to discover such heterogeneous catalysts, but success has so far been limited. Drs. Tysoe (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and Zaera (University of California-Riverside) have considerable experience in studying the surface chemistry of catalytic systems under ideal conditions.  Their research project focuses on understanding the molecular interactions that control enantio-selectivity in more complex and realistic systems for the advanced manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Drs. Tysoe and Zaera are strongly committed to educating women and minorities, in particular, Hispanic students both in the laboratory and through formal courses.  They participate in outreach programs at Milwaukee and Riverside, and are incorporating the research associated with this project into those activities.      <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Tysoe and Zaera are studying the surface chemistry of model palladium(111) and platinum(111) chiral catalysts modified by a cinchonidine analog, 1-(1-naphthyl) ethylamine (NEA), using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared absorption spectroscopy, reactivity measurements, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research provides a molecular-level understanding of the diastereomeric interactions between a number of prochiral reactants and NEA, and the forces that control them. They are investigating whether the detailed molecular understanding of the chiral surface chemistry from single-crystal studies in ultrahigh vacuum is relevant to the reaction pathways occurring under realistic conditions, that is, under atmospheric pressures and in the presence of a liquid phase. The resulting understanding may provide insights into how to improve catalytic selectivity.  The research may facilitate the targeted design of supported heterogeneous enantioselective catalysts. Such an ability is expected to have a significant economic impact in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Drs. Tysoe and Zaera focus on educating women and minorities through their research and outreach programs as part of the broader impacts of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional urban planning and management approaches (land reclamation, sea walls, etc.), and even newer initiatives (restoration science and other initiatives oriented toward making cities resilient) have tended to rely on models that assume adequate provisioning of public financial and infrastructural investment necessary to return coastal cities to a durable and dry equilibrium state. This project explores the diverse approaches urban administrators use to stabilize urban environments, where models forecast persistent uncertainties in public infrastructural planning and increased reliance on stakeholder inputs. The data will be important for American municipalities searching for alternatives in urban infrastructural planning around uncertain futures. Findings will be disseminated to various governmental, non-governmental, and other organizations concerned with evaluating the limits and opportunities associated with water and sewage infrastructure, and coastline management. The project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, and broadens participation through the inclusion of underrepresented students and scholars in scientific research. This project will also build scientific capacity and infrastructure through collaboration and increasing understanding of the causes, consequences, and complexities of human social and cultural variability.<br/><br/>Dr. Nikhil Anand of the University of Pennsylvania will explore how stakeholders and scientists in an urban coastline engage quotidian uncertainty in managing livelihoods and maintaining durable infrastructures. The research will take place in an urban community in Mumbai, which proves an ideal laboratory for exploring these questions because of the density of this urban area, the long tradition of coastal management by local stakeholders, and the existence of several major infrastructural projects along this coastline. This creates a rich environment for comparative analysis within the same urban context. The researcher will test the hypothesis that the habitation and management practices employed by these coastal communities inhibit environmental uncertainties. Seventeen months of fieldwork will be conducted through a range of ethnographic data collection and analytical techniques, including participant observation and interviews with stakeholders in the fishing industry, environmental scientists, and municipal officials.

Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism (LCAU) will host a Summer 2019 conference on Equitable Resilience. Equitable Resilience makes an important contribution to Sustainable Urban Systems by linking research on urban response to environmental stresses with research on the social distribution of those stresses and responses. Important examples include coastal city response to sea level rise, urban flooding beyond the 100-year floodplain, and planned relocation from hazardous areas. The conference aims to go beyond documenting linkages between resilience and equity, toward conceptual and analytical frameworks for re-designing those linkages. The workshops bring together scholars from urban design, urban planning, and building technology, along with urban environmental scientists. It has four panels: 1) Urban ecology, society, and resilient design; 2) Equitable access to urban information, technology, and resources 3) Equitable processes of urban relocation; and 4) Convergence between equitable resilience and sustainable urban systems. In each case, the workshops employ a network-of-networks approach for international knowledge dissemination and exchange, and makes that knowledge available through multiple scientific and educational platforms.<br/><br/>The 2019 Summer conference will integrate research on urban resilience, equity and sustainability. The workshops employ an international network-of-networks methodology to engage scientists, planners, and designers associated with MIT labs and centers to wider research networks. The workshops consist of two substantive and two integrative panels.  The first integrative panel on urban ecology, social science, and design examines multiple levers for coordinating conceptual, analytical, and normative domains of equitable resilience through chains of modeled and non-modeled inquiry.  The first substantive panel assesses strategies for reducing widening gaps in social access to urban resilience data, technologies, and resources using statistical cluster analysis of participants? urban databases as well as innovative social media apps, mapping, and hacking methods. The second substantive panel addresses downstream impacts of environmental hazards by extending Nansen Principles on climate-amplified displacement to equitable strategies for voluntary resettlement from high hazard areas.  The final integrative panel revisits the workshops' hypotheses regarding the value of Equitable Resilience research, planning, and design for Sustainable Urban Systems. Each panel invites leading peer reviewers to critically assess the work presented and promising directions.

Over the next decade, the biggest generator of data is expected to be devices which sense and control the physical world. This explosion of real-time data that is emerging from the physical world requires a rapprochement of areas such as machine learning, model based dynamical systems, and control and decision theory. While control theory has been firmly rooted in tradition of model-based design, the availability and scale of data (both temporal and spatial) will require rethinking of the foundations for the discipline. From a machine learning perspective, one of the main challenges going forward is to go beyond pattern recognition and address problems in data driven control and decision making as well as learning-based optimization of dynamical processes.<br/><br/>We propose a two-day inaugural conference on the interface between learning, dynamics and control to take place on May 30-31 at MIT. Long term we would like to sustain this event as an annual conference where best results on this emerging interface are presented. We aim to create a new community of people that think rigorously across the disciplines, ask novel fundamental questions, and develop the foundations of this new scientific area. We feel that our proposed effort will result in a very influential annual conference that can attract a lot of attention from numerous scientific communities. The intellectual merit of this proposal is the creation of a scientific forum that brings together pioneers and state of the art research in the areas of control systems, optimization, machine learning, and related disciplines to create a prestigious annual conference that defines the state-of-the-art in Learning for Dynamical and Control Systems. An elite conference on this topic can have tremendous impact not only scientifically by bridging two distant areas but also from a community perspective that nurtures a growing number of junior researchers working on this emerging interface.

Second, scholarly researchers may tend to carry out work without engaging stakeholders in communities and industry. Third, many research disciplines in arts and the humanities are not integrated into sustainability research teams. This workshop targets to fill those gaps. It will: explore new solutions to sustainability challenges in water, energy, and climate adaptation; study how sustainability solutions must vary with the scale of an urban system; identify novel ways to integrate researchers from arts and the humanities into sustainability research teams; and study how research is altered by deep integration of researchers with stakeholders from business, communities, and NGOs. <br/><br/>This workshop will develop implementable strategies to create and sustain a large scale research network that tackles urban sustainability in cities of all sizes with deep integration between researchers in many disciplines, municipalities, NGOs, and business partners. The workshop will identify critical gaps in research methodology and knowledge for solving sustainability problems in energy, water, and climate adaptation in a range of different types of urban systems, directing future sustainability research to improve the lives of more people in the coming time of climate change.

UNOLS Infrastructure is composed of a myriad of assets including ships and deep submergence vehichles, aircraft, and major instrumentation. Institutions or federal agencies own these facilities and it is through the UNOLS system that the community has access to them. Support for the UNOLS Office is traditionally provided by six Federal Agencies: National Science Foundation/Division of Ocean Sciences and Division of Polar Programs, Department of the Navy/Office of Naval Research (ONR), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of the Interior/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).<br/><br/>This proposal is for the University Washington to host the UNOLS Office for an initial term of five years from 2019 to 2023. Under the guidance and leadership of the UNOLS Office, much of the work is done through the volunteers from the scientific community who serve on standing committees. The UNOLS organization, founded in 1971, has played an important role in coordinating and improving the operations of the nation?s Academic Research Fleet. One of the important focus areas for UNOLS is to coordinate and schedule these national assets, to plan for the future, and to be able to identify and meet the scientific infrastructure requirements of the U.S. oceanographic research scientists, students and technicians. This enables the United States to make advances in science, education, and the public awareness of our natural environment. One of the critical functions that the UNOLS Office performs, through broad community involvement, is to assist in prioritizing the resources within the available budgets to ensure the advancement of the field of oceanography. It is through the UNOLS efforts that the office is able to assist the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies with providing community feedback and input on the future direction of oceanographic research in the United States. Through the various UNOLS meetings, workshops, reports, studies, and daily communication, UNOLS provides a conduit for open dialog between the agencies supporting this research and the scientific community being served. The NSF's mission to ""promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense"" are all aided by the UNOLS Office's ability to bring together the scientific minds to identify what are the science questions that need to be answered, and then to provide the safe platforms to conduct this important work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Access to and an understanding of advanced computational resources by researchers and practitioners from a wide variety of fields from the traditional sciences and engineering to medical research and the humanities/social sciences is no longer a luxury but rather a necessity if they hope to stay at the forefront of their respective field, advance knowledge, and improve the quality of life. In order for this to happen, it is critical that there exists a robust pipeline of experts with the requisite skills needed to leverage advanced computing resources. The Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC) Conference series goal is to provide a forum for discussing current practices, challenges, and opportunities across the entire spectrum of research computing practitioners, including computational scientists, end-users, students and support staff, as well as industry and government agency representatives. Building on the success of past conferences, this project aims to provide travel support to students to attend the PEARC19 conference and participate in the Student Program. This project, thus, serves the national interest as stated by NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The PEARC conference (now in its 3rd year), follows the five-year NSF supported the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) conference series. Students, including importantly, students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged sectors are recruited to attend PEARC19. The proposed PEARC19 Student Program provides the students with practical hands-on training in modeling, machine learning, scientific computing, data analytics and many other tools in the modern researcher?s toolkit that are needed to facilitate today's multidisciplinary research programs. The aim is to expose students to as broad a range of topics and practices in advanced research computing as possible with the goal of helping to recruit and train the next generation of research and computational scientists. Students participating in the student program receive an opportunity to contribute to the technical program by submitting a student paper and/or poster, sharing their research efforts and gaining feedback, insights and inspiration from like-minded experts at the conference. In collaboration with XSEDE Campus Champions program, students have the option to participate in the Student Champions program that provides them resources and a community of experts whom they may consult, which enables an opportunity to begin building a community around PEARC19 Student Program efforts that extends well beyond the one week in July when the students attend the conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the features of Sora's sound system, grammar and vocabulary which stand out in various significant ways, both from related languages and other languages of the region. These analyses will inform (and be informed by) current debates in language contact and language change in the South Asian and Southeast Asian regions, as well as by current work in linguistic typology, and may necessitate a reformulation of the prehistory of South Asia. Sora presents several challenging features, including a possibly unique form of noun incorporation that has been explicitly predicted to be impossible. Once these details of Sora are better understood, and its changes over time have been analyzed, new insights into the murky linguistic pre-history of South Asia will emerge. The project also offers unique opportunities for indigenous scientists to play major roles in the research as key team members, thus offering capacity building and STEM field research opportunities to some of the most underserved and underrepresented communities of scientists. It also helps promote the visibility of indigenous peoples whose histories have been missing from mainstream accounts of regional South Asian history. <br/><br/>The project will produce A Grammar of Sora (with texts, a comparative lexicon and grammar of the various Sora dialects) and create an exhaustive, annotated archival deposit of the Sora dialect materials. These are to be collected through a combination of spontaneous narrative recordings and targeted elicitation with speakers, recorded in audio and video format. Topics to be explored include the 'expressive' lexicon, which is a highly developed system in Sora with many attested complex reduplication patterns, as well as the systems of grammatical agreement seen in different verb classes. We will also examine the typological shifts that may have accompanied the Dravidian and Aryan migrations into South Asia that marginalized the groups already there, such as the Proto-Munda ancestors to the Sora, and the ancestral language to Kusunda to the periphery.

These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. <br/><br/><br/>In the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics).

Conventional understanding fails to predict such effects, beginning with hydrogen, the first element in the Periodic Table, and extending to other ""simple"" elements. This project explores this new world of materials when compressed up to five million atmospheres (5 megabars or 500 gigapascals). A key property to be explored is superconductivity - the ability of a material to conduct electricity without resistance - at very high temperatures, including possibly room temperature and above. Advanced experimental techniques to study materials to very high pressures while at variable temperatures are employed to synthesize and characterize these materials, and theoretical and computational methods are used to interpret the results as well as to predict new materials and their properties to guide syntheses. The results have implications for fields beyond condensed-matter physics, including chemistry, advanced technology, planetary science, and astrophysics. An important goal is education and training of graduate students and undergraduates in the field. There is also a component that impacts locally STEM education and the public understanding of science.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: Pressure is not a simple thermodynamic parameter but an effective tool for the creation of exotic materials and phenomena not accessible at ambient conditions. Materials subjected to pressures up to several hundred gigapascals exhibit unexpected properties, including very high-temperature superconductivity, counterintuitive bonding patterns and electronic topological states, entirely new crystal structures, and potentially new physics. Investigations of materials at these conditions thus test both the limits of experimental techniques as well as fundamental theory. Addressing these questions in ""simple"" elemental and molecular systems at ultrahigh pressures, the project is divided into the following tasks: 1. Very High Tc Superconductivity; 2. Metallization and Novel Transitions in Dense Hydrogen; 3. High-Pressure Electrides;  4. Novel Interfacial Phenomena at Megabar Pressures; 5. Unconventional and Exotic Compounds; and 6. Methods and Technique Development.  Each of the tasks involve tightly integrated experiment and computational theory.  In particular, the experimental effort takes advantage of new developments in diamond-anvil techniques and capabilities at advanced radiation facilities to explore the nature of these materials in extreme conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, African American and Hispanic people comprise less than 10% of the STEM workforce. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of Hispanic and African American students for STEM careers. We focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in STEM contexts that undermine their success. We uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the STEM interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students. In summary, the findings from this work will serve as an impetus for scholarship on minority stress interventions and ally engagement. Additionally, it will offer immediately applicable strategies for retaining African American and Hispanic students in STEM, a necessary step for increasing the representation of racial minorities in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This research pursues the overarching goal of developing and testing strategies that enhance the retention of African American and Hispanic students in STEM careers by identifying and evaluating ally behaviors that reduce the detrimental consequences of subtle discrimination. One explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. In so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. We advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in STEM. This reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. We blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. This work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support African American and Hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their STEM interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. In particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High biodiversity is often associated with a division of resources that allows many types of organisms to coexist with minimal competition. Indeed, unlike many other organisms on coral reefs, sponges are adapted to efficiently remove bacteria, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter from seawater by filter-feeding. Sponges are a dominant component of coral reefs worldwide and in the Caribbean, where their biomass exceeds that of reef-building corals. For almost a quarter century, the success of sponges in the Caribbean has been linked to their filter-feeding ability. However, recent work demonstrated that coexisting sponges on Caribbean reefs host unique communities of bacteria that might allow sponges to access multiple pools of nutrients that are not available to other organisms. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that ecologically dominant sponge species in the Caribbean have unique metabolic strategies that are mediated by their associations with microbes that live within the sponge body. This research will combine manipulative field experiments with a novel combination of modern analytical tools to investigate both filter-feeding by sponge hosts and the metabolic pathways of their microbes.  This work will advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary forces that have helped shape the species present on Caribbean coral reefs. Additionally, this project will support three early-career investigators and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Nova Southeastern University, Appalachian State University, Stony Brook University, and Smithsonian Marine Station. The investigators will also develop innovative outreach programs that expand existing platforms at their institutions to increase public engagement and scientific literacy. <br/><br/>Marine sponges have been widely successful in their expansion across ecological niches in the Caribbean, with biomass often exceeding that of reef-building corals and high species diversity.  However, whether this success is linked to efficient heterotrophic filter-feeding on organic carbon in the water column or to their evolutionary investment in microbial symbionts is yet to be fully elucidated. Microbial symbionts expand the metabolic capabilities of host sponges, supplementing heterotrophic feeding with inorganic carbon and nitrogen, mediating the assimilation of dissolved organic matter, and facilitating recycling of host-derived nitrogen.  Despite these benefits, microbial symbiont communities are widely divergent across coexisting sponge species and there is substantial variation in host reliance on symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen among host sponges; therefore, these associations likely mediate the ecological diversification of coexisting sponge species. The goal of this project is to test this transformative hypothesis by adopting an integrative approach to assess the individual components of holobiont metabolism (i.e., microbial symbionts and sponge host) in ten of the most common sponge species in the Caribbean. The investigators will isolate autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways and explore potential links between microbial symbiont community composition and the assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) from seawater. This project will elucidate whether Caribbean sponge species are on similar or divergent evolutionary trajectories, and will provide information that is critical for our understanding of how conditions in the Caribbean basin have shaped the evolution of benthic organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The success of this work will lead to a robust and high throughput technique capable of measuring the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of soft gels under wide range of conditions and provide a standard toolbox for engineers to realize quantitative designs based on these materials. The PI will also expand a Soft Squishy Lab to combine visual, tactile and hands-on modules to connect human perception of macroscopic properties to the underlying microstructures of soft materials at appropriate levels for K-12 students.<br/><br/>Gels are composed of crosslinked polymer network and solvent molecules. The crosslinks prevent the long polymers from dissolving in the solvent; rather the gel swells and shrinks as the small molecules migrate in and out. The solvent uptake is a two-way street: as the solvent diffuses into the network, the network deforms, leading to size and shape changes, while the deformation of the network also affects the rate and amount of solvent diffusing into or out of the network. Both the concepts and the behaviors of gels are sufficiently complex such that ample room exists for additional work to connect principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics to experiments. The proposed study will develop a technique based on an indentation method for characterizing the nonlinear thermodynamic and kinetic properties of gels. The new technique will allow for systematic characterization of various types of stimuli-responsive gels under different environmental conditions. Based on a complete set of data from the systematic measurements, an in-depth understanding of the structure-property relations of gels can be achieved. Consequently, a physics-based constitutive model will be built."

During this period, Native American populations in the continental US were affected by expanding trade networks, a growing reliance on agriculture, increasingly permanent settlements, and population growth. After AD 1492, European contact led to significant cultural changes as well as disease epidemics, demographic collapse, population restructuring, and genetic exchange with new tribes and non-native peoples. These developments are well documented, but it is not known how they influenced the genetic makeup of Native American populations. By characterizing genetic diversity, this project will help elucidate the genetic structure and evolutionary history of Native North Americans, improve our understanding of how sociocultural, demographic, and evolutionary change influences the human genome, and fill a critical need for genome-wide data from the indigenous inhabitants of the continental US, who have been underrepresented in scientific research and public genetic databases.  The project provides research experience and training for undergraduates, graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and a K-12 public school science teacher.  Educational modules are also being developed for high school and college science courses and for the Summer Internship for Native Americans in Genomics (SING).  This project therefore advances scientific knowledge, expands the participation of underrepresented groups in science, improves science education, and increases public engagement with science.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project is evaluating temporal and spatial patterns of genetic diversity in the Midwestern US using existing datasets from the region and new genetic data being collected from three burial populations in the Ohio River Basin.  The three major goals are: (1) characterize genomic diversity across time and space in the Ohio River Basin, (2) reconstruct the maternal population history of the Midwestern US using spatially and temporally diverse samples from the Ohio River Basin and the Illinois River Valley, and (3) evaluate whether sociocultural and evolutionary changes between 1000 and 1700 AD altered the genomic structure of an ancient population in the Ohio River Basin. To achieve these goals, genomic data will be collected using newly developed target capture and next-generation sequencing technologies. An extensive set of genomic markers (genome-wide SNPs, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and 23 Y chromosome STRs) will be analyzed, which will make it possible to test hypotheses about how post-1000 AD migration, genetic drift, and selection altered the genetic structure of Native Americans. Mitochondrial data from seven other eastern North American sites will be analyzed to develop models of regional interaction."

Yet, the once dominant staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) and the elkhorn coral (A. palmata) have decreased by more than 90% since the 1980s, primarily from disease. Their continuing decline jeopardizes the ability of coral reefs to provide numerous societal and ecological benefits, including economic revenue from seafood harvesting and tourism and shoreline protection from extreme wave events caused by storms and hurricanes. Despite their protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act since 2006, threats to the survival of reef-building acroporid corals remain pervasive and include disease and warming ocean temperatures that may lead to further large-scale mortality. However, hybridization among these closely related species is increasing and may provide an avenue for adaptation to a changing environment. While hybrids were rare in the past, they are now thriving in shallow habitats with extreme temperatures and irradiance and are expanding into the parental species habitats. Additional evidence suggests that the hybrid is more disease resistant than at least one of the parental species. Hybridization may therefore have the potential to rescue the threatened parental species from extinction through the transfer of adapted genes via hybrids mating with both parental species, but extensive gene flow may alter the evolutionary trajectory of the parental species and drive one or both to extinction. This collaborative project is to collect genetic and ecological data in order to understand the mechanisms underlying increasing hybrid abundance. The knowledge gained from this research will help facilitate more strategic management of coral populations under current and emerging threats to their survival. This project includes integrated research and educational opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. Students in the United States Virgin Islands will take part in coral spawning research and resource managers will receive training on acroporid reproduction to apply to coral restoration techniques. <br/><br/>Current models predict the demise of reefs in the next 200 years due to increasing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification. It is thus essential to identify habitats, taxa and evolutionary mechanisms that will allow some coral species to maintain their role as foundation fauna. Hybridization can provide an avenue for adaptation to changing conditions. Corals hybridize with some frequency and results may range from the introduction of a few alleles into existing parent species via introgression, to the birth of a new, perhaps better adapted genetic lineage. The only widely accepted coral hybrid system consists of the once dominant but now threatened Caribbean species, Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata. In the past, hybrid colonies originating from natural crosses between elkhorn and staghorn corals were rare, and evidence of hybrid reproduction was limited to infrequent matings with the staghorn coral. Recent field observations suggest that the hybrid is increasing and its ecological role is changing throughout the Caribbean. These hybrids appear to be less affected by the disease that led to the mass mortality of their parental species in recent decades. Hybrids are also found thriving in shallow habitats with high temperatures and irradiance suggesting they may be less susceptible to future warming scenarios. At the same time, they are expanding into the deeper parental species habitats. Preliminary genetic data indicate that hybrids are now mating with each other, demonstrating the potential for the formation of a new species. Further, hybrids appear to be capable of mating with both staghorn and elkhorn coral, perhaps leading to gene flow between the parent species via the hybrid. Research is proposed to address how the increase in hybridization and perhaps subsequent introgression will affect the current ecological role and the future evolutionary trajectory of Caribbean acroporids. Specifically, this collaborative project aims to answer the following questions: 1) What is the historic rate, direction, and degree of introgression across species ranges and genomes? Linkage block analysis based on genome-wide SNP genotyping across three replicate hybrid zones will answer this question. 2) What is the current extent and future potential of later generation hybrid formation? Morphometric and genetic analyses combined with in vitro fertilization assays will be used. 3) What mechanisms allow hybrids to thrive in hot, shallow waters? A series of manipulative in situ and ex situ experiments will determine whether biotic or abiotic factors favor hybrid survival in shallow waters. 4) Are hybrids more disease resistant than the parentals species? Disease transmission assays in reciprocal transplant experiments and histological analysis to determine the extent of disease will be conducted. A multidisciplinary approach will be taken that combines traditional and cutting edge technology to provide a detailed analysis of the evolutionary ecology of Caribbean corals."

Examples of such motions range from performing daily activities to breathing and heartbeat during sleep. These various scales of motions can be captured by fine-grained WiFi signals to perform continuous wellbeing monitoring. Wellbeing monitoring leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure is particularly attractive as it requires neither wearing body instrumentation nor active monitorng by the user. Such an approach would facilitate a broad range of healthcare related applications at home environments without frequent hospital visits, such as real-time prediction and prevention of certain health problems (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and sleep apnea). Using existing WiFi infrastructure for wellbeing monitoring not only advances and extends the applications that could be supported by WiFi networks but also enables easy and large-scale deployment in non-clinical settings due to the proliferation of WiFi networks. Additionally, the educational efforts include curriculum development, outreaching to high school students, and engaging both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>This project focuses on building a WiFi enabled continuous wellbeing monitoring framework for fine-grained sleep monitoring and vital signs tracking at home environments. Users do not need to wear any sensors or actively participate in the monitoring process. The proposed framework targets to advance techniques in device-free fine-grained sleep events identification and vital signs tracking during sleep by utilizing existing WiFi signals. The proposed framework develops device-free localization strategies, vital signs tracking methods and statistical learning techniques to depict a comprehensive picture of users' wellbeing. Such wellbeing information is further utilized to assist in real-time disease prediction by leveraging today's ever-growing mobile environments. A hierarchical multivariate logistic regression model is developed to effectively mine through health conditions and identify risk factors of certain diseases. Chances of developing certain health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, is promptly predicted.

However, new non-silicon thin film semiconducting metal oxides have gained prominence in recent years. They are a promising new technology for electronic devices, particularly next generation displays. Oxide electronics have high carrier mobility, allowing them to conduct current efficiently, and can be fabricated at low-temperatures. This makes them compatible with flexible electronics. Doped semiconductors are n-type or p-type, depending upon if the majority charge carriers are electrons or holes. The vast majority of thin film oxide semiconductors are n-type, which limits their applications to unipolar devices. The development of more sophisticated circuits using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology requires both p- and n-type devices. The goal of this project is to resolve the scientific questions that prevent the realization of high performance p- and n-type oxide semiconductors. This in turn will enable the development of low-temperature processed flexible CMOS inverters and other circuits. Fundamental device physics together with thermodynamic and kinetic considerations are the key components to enable in-situ synthesis of the oxides and fabrication of CMOS devices. The combination of fundamental materials processing and device fabrication has educational impacts in and out of the classroom at Baylor University. Low cost metal oxide technology is ideal for a prototype fabrication lab in an undergraduate course on electronic materials and devices. Strong connections between the PI and local industry will further enhance the value of the professional training experience for students. The project also includes outreach to local schools, such as The Annual Central Texas Science and Engineering Fair for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The recent development of several wide bandgap oxide semiconductors and the fabrication of basic thin film transistor (TFT) structures have garnered attention for applications in flexible electronics and high performance TFTs.  However, research efforts of these oxide TFT devices are currently limited to n-type oxide TFTs.  Recently, promising p-type oxides have emerged providing the opportunity to explore applications in oxide-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices.  The development of reproducible p-type oxide semiconductors and their TFT devices will greatly accelerate flexible electronics and will pioneer the development of new oxide CMOS devices. A simple binary oxide (SnOx, 1<x<2) is an emerging candidate for a p-type semiconductor due to the possible formation of ns2 hybrid orbitals.  However, the growth conditions for p-type SnOx are believed to be narrow, due to the formation of SnO2 (n-type) and the precipitation of metallic Sn.  This research suggests reproducible approaches to synthesize p-type oxide semiconductors at low temperatures (T) below 200 ?C.  Low-T (<200 ?C) in-situ synthesis of p-type SnOx (1<x<2) is a consequence of the thermodynamic instability of the metallization material in contact with SnO2.  The same metallization material must be thermodynamically stable with n-type In(Ga)ZnO.  This unique in-situ approach offers simple solutions to the complex challenges of synthesizing p-type oxides: the metallization of both p- and n-type oxide TFTs, and the low-T annealing processes (necessary for improving TFT performance). As a result, oxide CMOS devices will be fabricated in situ. This project also contains strategies for controlling hole carrier densities. The use of high pressure oxidation relates carrier density to the oxygen fugacity (i.e., effective reactivity), and the results will identify the defect-based doping mechanisms for p-oxides.  The information obtained from these investigations will be carefully correlated with TFT and CMOS device performance in order to understand the relations between synthesis, composition, material properties and device characteristics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will enable new classes of technologies, products, and services. The work will be done through a university-industry partnership between researchers at The University of Texas at Dallas and experts at MicroFab Technologies, a Dallas-area organization. The team will focus on two real-world applications: 1) printing customized wound treatments directly onto wounds arising from cancer tissue removal or traumatic injury, and 2) printing labels onto manufactured parts to increase assembly efficiency. Research outcomes will be integrated into engineering education workshops at UT Dallas, as well as exhibits at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in downtown Dallas.<br/><br/>There is a lack of specific knowledge of droplet motion on curved surfaces after deposition/impact, necessitating methods to detect and alter drop placement to regulate final fluid distribution.

A large proportion of the circuit blocks is either inactive or in a reduced-power state at any given time to satisfy the power and thermal constraints. This utilization wall has urged the semiconductor community to compromise the chip area and the speed of the circuit to reduce the overall power consumption. Despite the significant amount of research and growing necessity for a holistic power optimization technique, existing efforts to minimize power dissipation are typically not coherent and are disjointed into two pieces: i) the dynamic and static power loss at the load circuits is minimized or ii) the power loss during power-conversion is minimized. As a result, more than 32% of the overall power is dissipated during high-to-low voltage conversion before even reaching the load circuits in modern mobile platforms. Neither the preliminary works of the PI nor the previous studies present a holistic approach for the design and management of distributed on-chip power delivery and are of limited use to attain high overall voltage conversion efficiency and thermal-aware design.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to revisit and fundamentally tailor the design and management of on-chip power delivery infrastructure. As compared to the conventional schemes where the power network is designed targeting the full utilization of the overall chip area, the proposed research will provide an adaptive power delivery infrastructure that is tailored to provide high voltage conversion efficiency during both fully-utilized and under-utilized modes of operation. Novel voltage regulation techniques and support circuits, physical design of power delivery networks, and power management schemes will be proposed. Specific emphasis will be placed on parallel voltage regulation and delivery where the allocation, size, and type of individual regulators are optimized synergistically considering various possible tradeoffs. Regulator-gating will be used specifically to: i) force individual voltage regulators to operate in their most power-efficient region, ii) spread the concentrated heat that causes local hotspots, and iii) turn on the voltage regulators close to the active circuits to reduce noise. The research component of this project has broad implications across all sub-areas of semiconductor-related research as power efficiency has become the primary bottleneck. The education component of this project will provide guidelines on how different teaching techniques can be integrated in undergraduate and graduate level courses to enhance the engineering education. The PI will promote the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and build strong ties with a local historically black college to increase the enrollment of underrepresented minorities at the University of South Florida's Electrical Engineering Department."

To become motile, cells must undergo radical changes in their composition and behavior, the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT).  These radical changes arise as the network of genes controlling the state of the cell transitions from one type of stable fate to another. This project details a joint theory-experiment physics-biology effort to study how EMT is coordinated in space and time by chemical signals passed among the tumor cells.  The specific focus here is on the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway has been studied extensively for its role in developmental biology and has been implicated indirectly in cancer, but has never been studied systematically in this context. The hypothesis to be investigated is that this pathway can allow the formation of small clusters of cells that have undergone EMT together, and which thereafter travel as a collective en route to the establishment of a secondary tumor. If proven to be true, these ideas will shed light on the fundamental origins of metastasis and might in the future offer new strategies for both prognosis and treatment.<br/> <br/>Cell-cell interactions, both between tumor cells proper and between tumor and stromal cells, are known to be a key component of many solid tumors. The investigators will focus on how one of these interactions, that mediated by the Notch pathway, can coordinate cell phenotypes and can thereby control tumor progression. To accomplish this will require the use and extension of sophisticated theory techniques from the field of non-equilibrium pattern formation coupled to an experimental plan focused on pancreatic cancer cell lines to be studied in both 2d and 3d in vitro conditions, both without and with supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts. Of particular importance will be measuring spatial correlations of EMT state (and other known correlates) and comparing these to expectations based on different signaling assumptions. Iterating these experiments with increasingly realistic model-building and model-solving will allow for the creation of a quantitatively reliable picture for the collective behavior of the tumor, going well-beyond current individual cell approaches.<br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division at NSF."

In order to design future CPS security and privacy mechanisms, the two communities need to come closer together and leverage the insights that each has developed.

It is important to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance in coastal bacterioplankton and their different responses to salinity in nature because (i) it will provide fundamental understanding for how microorganisms evolve to inhabit environments with different salinities, and (ii) alterations in coastal salinity are connected to climate change, so the way these alterations affect abundant coastal microorganisms also alters the biogeochemical cycling of, e.g., carbon. The project will examine microbial adaptations to salinity and determine how changes in salinity affect microbial metabolism using two closely related groups of abundant coastal bacterioplankton as model taxa. In addition, the research will continue and expand microbiology Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (mCUREs) in high-throughput cultivation and microbial characterization at the Lousiana State University. Sections of freshman biology laboratories will learn how to isolate, characterize, and molecularly identify microorganisms from local aquatic systems. mCURE sections will lead to newly isolated strains, genome sequences, and physiological data, these results will be published with the contributing students as co-authors. The relative success of mCURE sections will be assessed compared to traditional freshman biology sections. mCURE sections will offer unique opportunities for LSU students by creating excitement about research through discovery of new organisms and generating knowledge of the coastal habitats that are essential to the livelihood of the Gulf Coast.<br/><br/>The evolutionary transition between salt- and freshwater environments occurs rarely in microorganisms. In one of the most abundant aquatic groups, SAR11, the transition between salt- and freshwater environments has happened only once: all freshwater SAR11 belong to subclade IIIb/LD12, which has also been found to inhabit coastal environments where salinity varies widely. The first reported isolates of the SAR11 freshwater clade LD12 and a member of the sister clade IIIa from the same region are now available. These pure culture representatives provide a powerful model for experimentally investigating adaptations to new environments in microorganisms, specifically (i) the genomic pathway and regulatory distinctions that arise during the evolutionary transition from marine to freshwater environments, and (ii) the physiological mechanisms that underlie the ecological restrictions imposed on microorganisms by ionic strength in coastal and freshwater environments. Furthermore, because these organisms have distinct differences in metabolic potential, the isolates facilitate testing (iii) the effects of changing coastal salinity on microbial contributions to other biogeochemical cycles, such as that for carbon. The project will test the hypothesis that the relative ionic strength tolerances between the sister lineages (LD12, IIIa) result from fundamental differences in metabolic flexibility at a genomic and regulatory level. To do so it will assess transcriptional and metabolic responses to varied ionic strength for both taxa and measure the distribution and activity of both groups in nature to translate laboratory findings to the field. The research will provide new understanding of LD12 habitat range and insights into how the ""freshwater"" lineage evolved from a SAR11 common ancestor.

If successful, this project has the potential to bring back high value-added manufacturing to the USA, creating jobs in the STEM disciplines.  <br/>  The innovative ecosystem that will be created includes partners such as Honeywell, Parker Hannifin, Bridgestone/Firestone, a small biotech company (Innovia), and LG Hausys.  Third party investors include the Rubber Division of the American Chemical Society by creating the International Center of Advanced Elastomers for Healthcare, and the Breast Cancer Innovation Foundation supporting the research if integrating breast reconstruction with cancer diagnosis and treatment. The potential economic impact is expected to be significant, creating new jobs in high value added manufacturing, new commercial products and students well-trained for the created jobs in the next 2-10 years   Students (high-school, undergraduate and graduate) will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through the transfer of the Allomatix technology into commercial products. Students will be motivated and challenged to develop novel ideas, and to defend the feasibility of their ideas in front of industrial partners.  <br/>  This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: to produce halogen-free rubber on a commercial scale that can compete with current halobutyl rubber; reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process; produce thermoplastic biocompatible rubber with a much cheaper and simpler process. The proposed objectives in the PFI:AIR are based on the Allomatrix technology. This new family of materials is the basis for all objectives, thus the first step is to scale up the polymerization and to produce sufficient material for product development and testing. In objective II we aim to develop an optimized sulfur curing system for tire applications, and non-sulfur curing systems for biomedical and other applications. In objective III new application development will be implemented with various partners based on the favorable properties of Allomatrix family of polymers. In objective IV the potential of the reduction of the carbon footprint of the polymerization system is examined. This objective is based on the insight of the polymerization system that was acquired during the development and optimization stages of the CenTiRe project. Lastly, objective V focuses on the examination of the feasibility of the material to be used in biomedical applications, such as investigation of cytotoxicity, material stability under physiological conditions and other aspects."

The goal of SHINE activities is to enrich and strengthen both the physical understanding and predictive capabilities for these phenomena. Since it?s inception in 1996, SHINE has grown into a vibrant community of researchers spanning a wide range of disciplines, but still primarily focused on understanding solar processes and their influence on the inner heliospheric environment.  A key factor in the success of the SHINE program is the annual summer workshop, which is highly valued for its uniqueness in style and effectiveness of communication. The workshops bring together a large number of active researchers in the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric communities, including, not least, a strong and growing student and post-doc population.  Typical numbers for students and postdocs attending the workshops are 65-75, which constitutes about 35% of the entire workshop population. The SHINE workshop provides students a unique opportunity to present their research, learn from experts in the field and network in a relaxed and collegial atmosphere.  The main purpose of this award is to continue the support for students and postdocs to attend the annual workshops.  <br/><br/>SHINE research focuses in particular upon: (i) the connection between events and phenomena on the Sun and their relation to solar wind structures in the heliosphere; (ii) the origin and evolution of the solar wind; (iii) the nature of turbulence in the interplanetary medium; and (iv) the production and transport of solar energetic particles from the Sun through the heliosphere.  The annual SHINE workshops provide un-matched opportunities for active discussions and new collaborative projects around these topics."

These rapid advancements have fundamentally changed information technology and the way of life. The information is stored in tiny magnets, like compasses with nanometer sizes. As each bit of information is stored over an ever-smaller volume, it is essential to use materials that are still stable at extremely small dimensions against thermal effects. This material property is known as the magnetic anisotropy, which anchors magnetic moments in place, enabling their practical use. This project aims at realizing materials with high magnetic anisotropy using convenient and benign synthesis conditions, combined with control over the material properties, towards applications in next generation ultrahigh density magnetic recording media and rare-earth-free and precious-metal-free permanent magnets. This GOALI partnership between U.C. Davis and Seagate offers an exciting opportunity to rapidly transfer research results into technology. This would potentially speed up the adaptation of the emerging heat-assisted magnetic recording technology. Advances in more powerful permanent magnets would impact numerous industry sectors, including hybrid and electric vehicles, magnetically levitated trains, wind turbines, power storage, magnetic refrigeration, etc. The partnership also provides opportunities to train junior researchers in industry research and development laboratories, in addition to excellent exposure to research experience in university and national laboratory and user facilities. The team plans to initiate and actively participate in a variety of efforts to broaden participation from underrepresented groups through internships, graduate course offering, exchange visits with Seagate, and other specific programs at the Magnetism Conference.<br/><br/>High magnetic anisotropy materials have critical applications in next generation ultrahigh density heat-assisted magnetic recording media as well as high energy density permanent magnets. Alloys of ordered FePt in the L10 phase is an ideal candidate for recording media applications. However, a critical challenge has been the high annealing temperature necessary to transform the as-deposited low anisotropy phase into the desirable high anisotropy one. This project will achieve high magnetic anisotropy L10 FePt-based thin films using atomic-scale multilayer sputtering and rapid thermal annealing. Magnetic properties of these materials will be tailored to achieve the desirable high anisotropy, large saturation magnetization, and low Curie temperature using ternary FePt-based alloys through proper tuning of the effective valence electron number. These approaches will be extended to realize L10 FeNi films that are alternative type of permanent magnets using earth abundant elements. A true understanding of the disorder-order phase transformation in these thin films will be gained, and quantitative evaluation of the phase fractions will be obtained. The partnership between U.C. Davis and Seagate will help to achieve L10 FePt and FeNi based alloys that can be readily synthesized, with controlled anisotropy at the atomic scale and minimized switching field distribution. Such materials have potentially transformative technological impacts, in speeding up the adaption for the emerging ultrahigh density heat-assisted magnetic recording technology and in the realization of high energy density permanent magnets that are rare-earth-free and precious-metal-free."

Also, a series of meetings will foster novel collaborations to more rapidly advance engineering technologies that are relevant to multiphoton neuroimaging in the future. Technology developed in the Nemonic project will also be relevant to manufacturing, 3D printing, and photonics. This work will also increase partnerships between academia and industry, enhance STEM training, and recruit and support the scientific training and careers of women and URM scientists.<br/><br/>The Case Studies will develop new instrumentation for large field-of-view two- photon and three-photon imaging, scalable temporal multiplexing, and integrated behavior.

Our understanding and modeling of the large-scale dynamics of the Earth climate system and associated regional-scale climate variability significantly affects our ability to predict and mitigate climatic extremes and hazards. Earth observations and climate model outputs are witnessing an unprecedented increase in data volume, creating new opportunities to advance climate science but also leading to new data science challenges that must be addressed using tools from mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This project focuses on two central challenges at the heart of modern data-enabled climate science: (1) Increasing the predictive capacity of subseasonal forecasts by discovering and quantifying the sources of (un)predictability, including known and emergent climate modes and their interactions and non-stationarities; and (2) Understanding and quantifying the intricate space-time dynamics of the climate system to provide guidance for climate model assessment and regional forecasting.  This project brings together an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in both hydroclimate science and statistical machine learning to create new platforms for climate diagnostics and prognostics.  The broader impacts of an enhanced knowledge of the climate system and robust and accurate seasonal forecasts have wide-ranging implications for society as a whole. For example, better seasonal forecasts will allow water resource managers to make sustainable decisions for water allocation.<br/><br/>This TRIPODS+CLIMATE project will develop novel machine learning and network estimation methodologies for analyzing the climate system over a range of space and time scales, to understand climate modes of variability and change and to explore their predictive ability for regional hydroclimatology. The two main objectives of this project are the following.  Objective 1: Develop novel classification and regression tools that account for highly-correlated features or covariates, nonlinear interaction terms in high-dimensional settings, and nonstationarity in climate observations. These tools will be used to improve seasonal-to-subseasonal forecasts of regional precipitation using multidimensional climate modes and feature vectors in the presence of evolving dynamics and nonstationarities. Objective 2: Develop network identification methods that leverage recent advances in machine learning and statistics and that can account for the nonstationarity and limited timeframe of climate data. The network representation will be used to analyze the structure and dynamics of the learned dependencies to contextualize and interpret them physically, and to quantify changing patterns in climate modes and their regional predictive capacity.  Emphasis will be placed on the western Pacific dynamics where an interhemispheric bi-directional connection has recently been discovered, promising earlier and more accurate seasonal-to-subseasonal forecasts in the southwestern US and other parts of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both climate models and observations suggest that this slowdown or ""hiatus"" in warming may be attributed (at least in part) to strong trade-winds in the tropical Pacific. These strong winds transport heat into the subsurface ocean, leaving less heat to warm the atmosphere. Because wind strength changes on a decade-to-decade timescale (associated with natural variability in the Pacific), other periods of both accelerated and reduced warming over the last 100 years are likely tied to these changes in tropical trade-winds. Thus, warming will likely accelerate in the coming decade(s) when the cycle reverses and trade-winds weaken once again. However, our understanding of the link between global air temperatures and tropical Pacific wind strength to date has been limited by the scarcity of historical wind observations. This project will utilize the chemical fingerprints of changes in tropical Pacific winds captured in the skeleton of living and fossil corals to investigate past wind variability - and its link to global air temperatures - across the past century and preindustrial era. The research will also extend the application of this novel wind archive, providing key groundwork for such records to be extended to additional sites and time periods.  These natural archives of tropical Pacific wind strength over the recent past have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of the impact of wind variability on the rate of global climate change. This project will also contribute to broadening participation and diversity in science by supporting two early career female scientists, a minority postdoctoral researcher and two undergraduates, who will together develop programs to promote race, gender, and LGBTQ diversity, equity and inclusion at Boston University. <br/><br/>Tropical Pacific coral records have dramatically improved our understanding of the oceanic response to changes in climate forcing over the past millennium, but our understanding of the associated atmospheric response remains limited by uncertainties in the interpretation of (often indirect and/or remote) hydrological proxies. This project leverages existing modern and fossil coral cores and a promising new coral proxy to investigate tropical Pacific trade wind variability across changes in natural and anthropogenic forcing. Building off pioneering studies linking westerly wind anomalies and coral skeletal Mn/Ca at Tarawa Atoll, the project will calibrate and extend this new proxy across sites (Tarawa, Kiritimati, Butaritari, and Palmyra) and time periods (20th century and Little Ice Age/preindustrial). Initial results demonstrate that coral Mn/Ca from Kiritimati and Butaritari capture the westerly winds observed at these sites during the 1997/98 El Nio event, supporting the causal link between wind variability and coral Mn/Ca at atolls with west-facing lagoons, and thus the potential for extending Mn/Ca-based trade-wind reconstructions across space and time. This project will produce the first robust, well-replicated, and quantitative reconstructions of Pacific trade wind strength spanning the 20th century and Little Ice Age (LIA) to preindustrial period (1400-1850CE) using overlapping modern and fossil corals from the western and central equatorial Pacific. This project also lays the foundation for coral Mn/Ca-based trade-wind reconstructions to be expanded to other sites and time periods by exploring the strengths and limitations of this novel proxy. Such trade-wind reconstructions have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of trade-wind variability and its impact on global climate change in response to both natural and anthropogenic forcings."

Key challenges are to effectively assimilate information across these domains to identify genomic signatures and biological entities that may be targeted by drugs, develop accurate risk prediction profiles for future patients, and identify novel patient subgroups for tailored therapy and monitoring.  The primary objective of this project is the development of an innovative, flexible and scalable statistical framework for analyzing  multi-domain, complex-structured, and high throughput  modern array and next generation sequencing-based 'omics datasets.  The work is motivated by several investigations related to lung cancer; however, the proposed methods and computational tools are broadly applicable in a variety of contexts involving high-dimensional data.  From a broader scientific perspective, the application of these novel methodologies to the motivating clinical and genomic datasets will allow for principled ""structure hunting"".  This will provide more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes, greater statistical power to detect important biologically actionable biomarkers for improved risk estimation and treatment selection for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and better utilization of biological domain knowledge to find relationships between different platforms.  It will lead to subsequent implementation of rational biomarker-based and individualized clinical trials that increase the success rate of personalized therapies based on molecular markers.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the following specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop versatile and flexible statistical techniques for identifying differential genomic signatures for lung cancer in mixed, heterogeneously scaled single-domain datasets arising from array and next-generation sequencing based studies.  A general class of nonparametric Bayesian models based on sound theoretical justifications will be developed and implemented using efficient, scalable algorithms.  These models provide biologically interpretable summaries and enable applicability to a wide variety of high-throughput datasets.  (2) Formulate integrative probabilistic frameworks for massive multiple-domain data, which coherently incorporate dependence within and between domains to accurately detect tumor subtypes and predict clinical outcomes, thus providing a catalogue of genomic aberrations associated with cancer taxonomy.  (3) Foster massively parallel algorithms and high-performance computational and inferential tools that drastically reduce the computation times and increase scalability of high-throughput datasets.  These scalable inferential procedures are able to assimilate information from several platforms and select flexible models with the appropriate dependence structures, while detecting optimally sparse, non-linear mechanisms for predicting and identifying tumor subtypes.  Because these formulations are fully probabilistic, they offer substantial improvements over purely algorithmic approaches by accounting for different sources of variation and providing measures of inference uncertainty.  Since existing simulation-based algorithms do not scale for massive datasets, theoretical properties of these models will be exploited to devise data-squashing algorithms for efficient inference.  Furthermore, as traditional CPUs are limited by energy consumption, heat generation and memory access, software that harnesses the power of low-cost massively parallel computing tools such as graphics processing units (GPUs) will be developed and made freely available."

He asked whether the properties of his integral are really fundamental and follow from more familiar integral axioms.  The class of amenable groups was introduced and studied by von Neumann in 1929, and he explained why a paradox appeared only in dimensions greater or equal to three. In the 1940s the amenability theory shifted into the field of functional analysis.  Currently amenability theory appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The core part of the project is based on the recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable. PI plans to develop this technique in a more conceptual way using random walks on Schreier graphs. There are several classes of groups to which the technique can potentially be applied. They include Thompson group F, interval exchange transformation group, topological full group of abelian groups. The expected impact of the project is to give deeper understanding of analytic properties of the group actions and relate them to other fields. One of the central impact of this proposal is through its educational goals, in particular, in organizing of several summer schools and workshops.  The schools are aimed toward graduate students and other young researchers, focused on the recent developments in group theory and operator algebras."

These skills affect how children interact with the social and physical contexts they encounter in their peer groups. Ultimately, such skills support children's readiness for formal schooling and underlie mastery of the academic content presented in school. This study uses direct observations, interviews, experimental tasks, and standardized tests to measure both social competence and executive function in children. Adults' ratings for these domains are also employed. <br/><br/>The central hypotheses are: 1) social competence and executive functions are significantly related across academic years; 2) social competence is a significant cause of age-related changes in executive functions; 3) individual differences in children's social engagement at age 3 years will predict the degree of positive change in executive functions at age 4 years; and 4) social competence and executive function predict school readiness and academic achievement. Support for these hypotheses in statistical analyses will demonstrate that developmental domains are integrated during early childhood and that social processes leading to social competence promote positive change in children's executive function capacity. This would suggest modifications to current Pre-K curricula, which would take advantage of the impacts that peer interactions have on growth of executive functions and on children's readiness for formal schooling and achievement in school contexts."

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression. Large-scale human patient datasets of pancreatic lesions, provided by our consultants through a separately funded project, will be used to validate and refine the models. The project will enhance the cross disciplinary training of students."

The network will develop and test an innovative model for conducting interdisciplinary, region-specific, sustainability research closely tied to the needs and interests of highly-engaged local stakeholders. RCN CE3SAR will aggregate regional research capacities specific to sustainability in semiarid climates contiguous to the Gulf of Mexico while leveraging research expertise infused from outside the region. Geographic information science (GIS) will play a key role in the process of integrating layers of scientific data, producing scientific insight and presenting new ideas, new research directions and new scientific knowledge to regional stakeholders as well as the scientific community. The network will align regional capacities that heretofore were largely disconnected and bring focus and synergy to a range of research that will profoundly impact the region and its socioeconomic future. The network will engage and educate regional communities, government and private-sector stakeholders throughout the process.<br/><br/>South Texas comprises 28 counties, eight of which border Mexico and eight the Gulf of Mexico, where coastal marine and estuarine environments quickly become semiarid regions historically susceptible to drought. Climate change and its ripple effects, from rising seas to parched riverbeds, will profoundly affect South Texas socioeconomic structures, geographic distribution patterns and educational and cultural institutions. While much sustainability science focuses on global scales, local communities and institutions in South Texas and elsewhere face crucial decisions over the next 20 years driven by sustainability issues related to water, energy and use of space. Scientific knowledge must be available at relevant scales for those decisions to be informed by sustainability research; moreover, the science must be understood and accepted by the community, which plays a vital role in implementing the research results into its decision making and infrastructure. Experience has shown that importing researchers from outside the region with little or no connection to the community results in low acceptance of research results by local decision-makers and by the community at large; moreover, South Texas has been historically isolated and its residents suspicious of 'outsiders'.  In order for sustainability research to have a salutary and substantive local impact, it must be advanced by regional researchers who also draw on national and international expertise."

Changes in the character and seasonal cycle of nearshore sea ice is of particular importance to indigenous communities that use the nearshore sea ice as a platform for subsistence hunting and transportation.  Observations and model projections also suggest increasing freshwater runoff to the coastal ocean from increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, thawing of permafrost, and precipitation over land.  This runoff impacts the sea ice that forms in the fall.  Sea ice formed under freshwater influence reveals differences in salinity, porosity, and permeability, and thus its optical and mechanical properties.  This project will provide unique observations of sea ice formation and structure under conditions of freshwater influence.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM workforce development through provision of support for the training of a graduate student.  It will also entrain undergraduate students from Dartmouth?s Women in Science Project (WISP).  One undergraduate will participate in the spring field work.  The project will also apply for support for a PolarTREC teacher.  K-12th grade outreach activities will be offered and will leverage existing programs at University of Washington such as participation in the Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center.  <br/><br/>The freshwater discharge to the coastal ocean affects thermodynamic processes in sea ice by changing salinity and temperature of the waters undergoing freezing.  This three-year pilot project is designed to study sea ice formation and structure in the coastal ocean, while addressing the following important questions:<br/>1. How do microstructure and the brine pocket network differ in sea ice that forms and grows where there is significant fresh water input compared to sea ice in the open ocean?<br/>2. Can we monitor the onset of freezing, freezing rate and ice type in situ in sensitive nearshore areas, while collecting data remotely?<br/>3. How does microstructure affect heat transfer along the length of an ice core?<br/>The project will combine recently developed observation and sampling technologies, and integrate expertise in field monitoring, and physical and chemical sea ice characterization. Sea ice formation, growth rate, and salinity will be monitored in situ at a location of freshwater input during the course of a growth season using a wire ladder.  Oxygen isotopic ratios and optical thin section stratigraphy will be used to quantify freshwater influence.  X-ray micro-computed tomography will be used to characterize porosity and brine channel topology at 1 cm intervals along ice cores and provide quantitative data on microstructural differences in ice influenced by the freshwater.  Laboratory tests and modeling will be used to examine heat transfer through sea ice cores held at their in situ temperature gradient, as a function of microstructural stratigraphy."

The final engineering design is thus handicapped by the initial material selection. A material designer, on the other hand, works with a library of material compositions and processing methodologies with a goal to discover how new properties emerge from microstructure control, for example. The focus of material design is thus limited to achieving specific property enhancements without considering the end application of the material. There is a need to unify the material and engineering design processes so that new materials can be intentionally designed with the specific goal of incorporation into a useful product, and the engineering design can be freed from the upfront material-based constraints. This project will establish a concurrent design process combining top-down goal-oriented decision-making to optimize engineering system performance with bottom-up constraint-aware algorithms to efficiently search the domain of feasible material designs for polymer nanocomposites. This research project will provide innovation in design methodologies, enabling a competitive advantage to our nation's manufacturing industries as well as energy and defense technologies. <br/><br/>This award supports fundamental research for the development of a new design paradigm termed Concurrent, Unified, State-aware Tailoring of Materials (CUSToM). The PIs will take a Bayesian approach to searching over the design domain, facilitating explicit consideration of the uncertainties in every aspect of the process. In the CUSToM framework, computer simulation (either empirical or first-principles based) is an integral part of the search process capturing the material scientist's domain knowledge. The hypothesis underlying this project is that the top-down search processes engrained in the CUSToM framework will yield products with superior performance compared to those obtained with conventional materials design. This hypothesis will be tested on the design of polymer nanocomposites with precisely determined material microstructure, composition, and processing methods for applications in wind energy; specifically high-strength, light-weight composites for next generation wind turbine blades. The broader impacts of this work will go beyond providing a new design paradigm for engineered materials to include the training of undergraduate and graduate researchers, exposure of undergraduate and graduate students to the world of entrepreneurship, and outreach to K-12 students in order to motivate them towards careers in STEM related fields."

The Caltech Cohort Study (CCS) will track the entire<br/>undergraduate student body of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) over several years. It<br/>uses repeated, incentivized surveys to elicit behavioral proxies: risk aversion, strategic sophistication,<br/>competitiveness, social behavior, etc. The results will be married with objective outcomes: academic,<br/>social, and financial. The project will examine the evolution of attributes over college years, the<br/>formation of social interactions, and ultimately how certain attributes interact to produce educational<br/>outcomes. The CCS also serves as an ideal environment for answering fundamental questions about<br/>the external validity of incentivized surveys and laboratory experiments.<br/><br/>The CCS has four unique features. First, Caltech's small size makes it possible to track nearly<br/>the entire student body over time (90% of students completed the first three surveys). Second, the<br/>survey design allows measurement of a large set of behavioral traits for each individual. Third,<br/>the repeated nature of the study makes it possible to track the stability of these traits across time<br/>with minimal selection bias. Fourth, the array of behavioral traits elicited can be tied to real-world<br/>behaviors and outcomes. The combination of these elements should be invaluable for a large battery<br/>of basic social science questions.<br/><br/>The proposed study has the potential to improve the educational process in US higher education.<br/>Understanding what impacts social and scholastic outcomes will help design certain aspects of college<br/>education aimed at increasing well-being and academic performance, as well as furthering gender and<br/>racial equality.<br/><br/>The proposal focuses on three areas. First, the dataset's longitudinal nature will allow for a careful<br/>inspection of the stability (or lack thereof) of a wide array of behavioral attributes. Second, the rich<br/>data on different layers of interactions over time (social, academic, and geographic) combined with<br/>the comprehensive set of elicited attributes will allow us to study network formation processes. Last,<br/>the data can be cross-checked against Caltech's experimental laboratory data to examine the impacts<br/>of selection into experiments as well as the differences in responses occurring in the lab and outside.<br/>The survey will also allow for a comparison of responses across other platforms and populations.<br/>Ultimately, the detailed longitudinal data that will be collected have the potential to uncover<br/>predictors of academic outcomes (chosen major, grades, and graduation), and the channels affecting<br/>the evolution of different traits."

Cells tune the strength and specificity of responses by changing the number of receptors available on the surface, by transporting them to and from compartments inside the cell. Therefore, how receptor transport is regulated is a fundamental question that is critical to understanding how cells respond and adapt to their environment. This project addresses this question by integrating direct visualization of the dynamics of receptor movement in living cells in real time, quantitative modeling, and molecular genetics, to test a mechanistic model for how receptor transport is regulated and how this regulation influences cellular responses. Through its broader impacts, this project offers an opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students in using microscopy to address mechanistic questions, and to iteratively integrate microscopy, quantitative data analysis, and modeling to address cell biological questions. Further, to reach a broader community and promote the use of quantitative imaging in education at an early stage, the PI will actively introduce the tools developed and the information obtained to both science-focused and general public forums, including among students and teachers in high schools with underrepresented minorities, and in lifelong learning centers, in the Pittsburgh area.<br/><br/>The endosome serves as the primary sorting station for proteins, including signaling receptors, that are internalized from the cell surface. Of the four main pathways taken by internalized receptors in the endosome, three - bulk recycling, degradation, and trafficking to the Golgi - have been extensively studied, and the mechanisms identified have each defined major new directions in cell biology. This project addresses the fourth and comparatively less studied pathway - sequence-dependent recycling. Many signaling receptors are restricted to this pathway, but how and why are not known. A major hurdle in studying this process has been the lack of direct assays to visualize and analyze receptor sorting in real time. Emerging data indicate that endosomal sorting relies on kinetic principles, further emphasizing this. Therefore, the research goals of this project are to develop and use quantitative live-cell imaging approaches to directly visualize the sorting of B2AR, a member of the largest family of signaling receptors, as a prototype for sequence-dependent recycling, and to integrate the data obtained into quantitative models to test a mechanistic hypothesis for receptor sorting. By using approaches from whole-cell to single-event imaging, the project will test the hypotheses that signaling receptors are actively restricted to sequence-dependent recycling by their interactions with the putative endosomal complex identified, and that these interactions serve as control points for signaling pathways to reprogram receptor trafficking and signaling. The educational goal of this project is to promote quantitative microscopy as a mechanistic tool and train graduate and undergraduate students in methods in quantitative cell biology."
