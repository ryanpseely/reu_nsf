The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Effective information processing is crucial for species to respond appropriately to their environment, particularly in social species like humans that integrate a wide range of individual experiences into collective responses. Theoretical models that are grounded in real world observations are needed to explain and predict patterns of social communication across species. This research addresses this need by using the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) to trace the flow of nutritional information throughout the colony. Bumblebee colonies are an optimal model to test key hypotheses in social communication due to their complex social behaviors and ease with which they can be manipulated for study. This research will leverage this model, integrating methods in behavioral ecology and deep-learning, to study the role of colony size, communication, and individual variability on the social network formed following a successful foraging expedition. This research will be accompanied by educational activities focused on increasing STEM engagement among incarcerated college students, who historically have not had opportunities to critically engage with scientific thinking.<br/><br/>This research seeks to answer three questions: 1) What are the individual dynamics which underlie bumblebee communication? 2) How does the communication network change with colony size? 3) How does individual variation impact communication? To answer these questions, the fellow will utilize a deep-learning pipeline to track the location of all bees in a colony, as well as their body parts. The fellow will generate a multimodal social network consisting of different modalities of interaction between bumblebees. An experiment will be designed to monitor network behavior before and after introducing a highly nutritious foraging source discovered by a single bee. This will identify key ?network archetypes? in bumblebee communication and examine how these archetypes vary between individuals. Through answering these questions, this research will develop an empirically rooted framework of information processing within a social setting. The fellow will receive training in analysis of real-time foraging dynamics, naturalistic rearing settings, and mathematical modeling of biological networks. In the spirit of open science, findings will be incorporated into outreach events with the UW-Madison Agriculture Institute, and all data and computational methodologies will be broadly disseminated. The fellow, in collaboration with the UW-Madison Prison Education Initiative, will also develop biology curricula and courses to teach incarcerated students across Wisconsin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. A fundamental goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how organisms adapt and change in response to their environments. But this is challenging to study in nature because most organisms we observe today have been evolving gradually in concert with their environmental conditions for thousands to millions of years. To work around this challenge the fellow will use the wild population of parrots (genus Amazona) in southern California, which descend from pet birds released within the last 70 years, as a natural experiment. This natural experiment will reveal how quickly bird populations are able to adapt to new environments and reveal the physical and genetic changes that help them to survive and thrive alongside humans in urban areas. Members of the local southern California community can play an active role in the project by contributing their photos and observations of parrots to community science databases. Additionally, the fellow will work with education specialists from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to develop public presentations and table displays informing visitors about ongoing study of the well-known southern California parrots.<br/><br/>Because urbanization and human development continue to modify environments at a global scale, we need to understand the capacity of organisms to adapt to these increasingly urbanized landscapes. This project will treat the independent introduction and establishment of four species of Amazona parrots from the pet trade into southern California as a replicated experimental framework for studying the ability of birds to rapidly adapt to a highly urbanized environment. Undergraduate and graduate researchers will be trained in using museum specimens to quantify the physical and genetic characteristics of each species. These characteristics will be quantified in each species? native range and then compared to the wild parrot populations across urban southern California. After quantifying the extent of phenotypic, behavioral, and genomic adaptation in each species, the fellow will search for changes shared across species with parallel direction and similar magnitude. Any parallel changes identified may reveal broadly shared responses that shape the evolutionary trajectories of vertebrate species facing increased urbanization across the globe. Ultimately, this project will increase our understanding of the speed and repeatability of adaptation to urbanization in wild vertebrate populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. In tropical areas with thousands of species, many different birds coexist in the same environment. These species often look remarkably different, exhibiting a variety of colors and patterns that distinguish them to human viewers and to one another. Plumage colors act as species-specific ?identifiers? which enable birds to recognize and choose mates from their own species instead of others. This mate choice allows different birds to coexist in the same place as distinct species. The project explores the evolutionary history and genetic basis of vibrant plumage coloration in one group of tropical birds (tanagers), to understand species formation and coexistence. Simultaneously, the fellow will contribute to the growth and modernization of natural history museums by developing exhibits on bird color and sensory biology; creating publicly available 3D digital images of the oldest and most priceless specimens; and mentoring junior scientists at Louisiana State University.<br/><br/>To elucidate the geography of signal trait (color) evolution and the role of interspecific interactions in trait evolution and the transition to sympatry, the fellow will explore two major aims using one subfamily of tanagers (Thraupinae) as a representative clade. 1) With a microevolutionary population genomic approach, the fellow will address whether a single divergently colored plumage patch differentiated in allopatry or due to interspecific interactions in parapatry in one hybridizing species complex within the focal clade. This project will also improve our knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of structural color, a widespread but poorly understood phenotype. 2) Scaling up to a comparative phylogenomic approach, the fellow will evaluate a macroevolutionary role for interspecific interactions in signal trait evolution. This project integrates whole-genome sequences with whole-body plumage phenotypes to investigate relationships among geographic coexistence, color divergence, introgression histories, and positive selection on known color-associated genes. Importantly, by scanning for historical introgression in sympatric species, this project will improve our ability to predict the outcomes of active parapatric hybrid zones, which are common in birds and many other taxa. Through this work, the fellow will develop advanced bioinformatic/coding skills and professional collaborations bridging genomics, phenotype evolution, and ecological assembly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Ponds and lakes are experiencing increases in harmful algal bloom (HAB) events globally. Cyanobacteria capable of forming HABs produce compounds that can be toxic to pond-dwelling organisms. However, these toxins can help these organisms protect themselves from parasites. Since the frequency of HABs is increasing, many generations of pond-dwelling organisms may consume them for their benefit against parasites. This research will investigate how HABs affect disease epidemics in pond-dwelling organisms, which is important from both an ecological and public health perspective. The fellow will receive training in genetic and evolutionary techniques. This research will advance our knowledge on how HABs may change patterns of disease in lakes and ponds and how cyanotoxins work against fungal pathogens. Furthermore, the fellow will support the training and professional development of future scientists. <br/><br/>Phytoplankton secondary metabolites can protect aquatic hosts from disease. However, how these medicinal diets shape host population dynamics, parasite evolution, and parasite epidemics in nature is still unknown. This research will focus on how phytoplankton can influence disease dynamics in freshwater ecosystems using the Daphnia-parasite system. First, this project aims to uncover the molecular basis for parasite susceptibility in the Daphnia-Metschnikowia host-parasite system and determine whether susceptibility is related to gut enzyme profile and genes. This will be done using quantitative trait mapping and genome wide association approaches to locate susceptibility genes by focusing on chymotrypsin and trypsin genes which are the target of cyanobacterial peptides. This will be combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify gut enzyme profiles associated with parasite susceptibility in Daphnia. This research will also explore if medicinal cyanobacterial diets select for more virulent parasites by conducting evolution experiments with two different parasites of Daphnia. These two parasites have different infection mechanisms and are impacted differently by medicinal cyanobacterial diets, providing an opportunity to observe differences in virulence selection. Lastly, this project will also look at parasite epidemics of Daphnia communities in ponds along a gradient of urbanization to detect patterns in the phytoplankton communities that may be either facilitating or impeding disease in Daphnia in this system of ponds. The fellow will train in genomics, population genetics and experimental evolution to address eco-evolutionary research questions.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Despite the numerous known associations between the human gut microbiome and health or disease, progress towards establishing what causes these outcomes has been slow. Most microbiome studies focus on analyzing feces, which allows analysis of the large intestinal microbiome. However, there is a knowledge gap about the microbiome in the small intestine (SI), which is a site of important host?microbe interactions. This project will probe how individual SI microbes and SI microbial communities respond to stressful host factors and protect against pathogens. Results will increase basic biological knowledge that may aid in developing effective microbiome-targeted therapies. The fellow will engage in public outreach, including writing blog posts and developing a strategy card game to enable students to learn core ecological principles in informal settings.<br/><br/>This research will capitalize on a novel capsule device that non-invasively samples both chemicals and viable microbes across the entire gastrointestinal tract, including the SI. In addition to characterizing the bulk microbial composition using next-generation DNA sequencing, the fellow will isolate SI microbes to generate a diverse strain collection. Using high-throughput in vitro growth assays, the fellow will quantify how different oxygen tensions and bile acids, which participate in digestion, impact microbial growth. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry will be used to elucidate how supplemented bile acids are chemically transformed by the microbes. Both top-down undefined and bottom-up synthetic microbial communities will be constructed to probe the emergent effects of bile acid metabolism as well as their colonization-resistance potential against SI pathogens isolated from patients diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Collectively, these studies will enhance mechanistic understanding for the interplay among the SI, distal GI tract, and host. By exploiting large-scale in vitro growth data, this work will derive fundamental principles that predict in vivo microbial behavior. In performing this research, the fellow will receive training in microbial isolation and culturing, next-generation sequencing, and large-scale data analysis. The fellow will train and mentor undergraduate students to use interdisciplinary approaches to investigate the gut microbiome across molecular, organismal, and host scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Plants shape the lives of soil microbes in many ways, not only by providing nutrients and water, but also by releasing airborne chemicals called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These VOCs can serve as food for microbes, but they also act as clues about microbial activity ? when microbes consume and emit VOCs, they leave behind chemical fingerprints that reveal their presence and function. Unlike traditional microbiology methods that require digging up soil, VOCs can now be measured continuously underground, allowing real-time observations of microbial processes. The fellow will use VOCs to study how plants influence microorganisms in desert soils, to understand how microbial consumption affects VOC movement, and how much this expands the influence of the plant beyond its roots. This project will advance methods for measuring microbes in soil and reveal new ways that plant roots shape soil ecosystems. It will also support STEM education by training high school and undergraduate students in environmental microbiology and data science, preparing them for careers in ecological research.<br/><br/>This research will integrate real-time VOC measurements with multi-omic approaches to characterize soil microbial phenotypes in response to plant root influences in desert soils. Aim 1 will investigate how spatial and temporal nutrient and moisture gradients in the plant root system influence microbial metabolisms, defining VOC flux profiles as indicators of microbial functions. Aim 2 will assess how VOC diffusion, microbial consumption (gene expression and metabolite profiles), and soil moisture extend rhizosphere boundaries, challenging the known scope of plant-microbe interactions. By establishing VOCs as real-time indicators of microbial activity and redefining rhizosphere boundaries, this work will expand techniques for measuring ecosystem function and improve dryland ecosystem models. The project will provide the fellow with advanced field, lab and computational training in volatilomics, multi-omic integration, and atmospheric data science. Broader impacts include mentoring high school and undergraduate students in microbial ecology and data science and developing a computational training module that integrates fieldwork and data analysis to support early-career scientists. Through these activities, the project will advance soil microbial ecology while promoting STEM education and training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Mushroom-forming fungi are an understudied, but ecologically and economically important group of organisms. They spend most of their lives as dikaryons, with two genetically different nuclei in every cell. However, it is unclear how cells with two nuclei coordinate gene expression, which is essential for cells to function. These nuclei may contribute equally to gene expression, or one may contribute more than the other. This project will measure the contribution of individual nuclei in a dikaryotic cell to gene expression. The findings from this project will contribute to our understanding of how mushroom-forming fungi regulate growth and development, as well as respond to their environment. <br/><br/>This project will quantify the relative contribution of different nuclear types to transcription under (I) different genetic backgrounds (nuclear and mitochondrial) and (II) abiotic stress to investigate how genotype x genotype and environment x genotype interactions shape gene expression in dikaryotic (two haploid nuclei/cell) fungi. Haploid (monokaryotic) isolates of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus subaureus will be isolated from spores and then paired to form different combinations of nuclear and mitochondrial genotypes. RNA from each genotypic combination will be extracted and sequenced, and reads will then be mapped to their nucleus of origin to quantify the relative contributions of each nuclear type to transcription. This project will test both the effect of nuclear and mitochondrial genotype, as well as environmental stressors, on the relative expression levels of individual nuclear types. This research will further scientific understanding of how individual genomes (nuclear and mitochondrial) contribute to gene expression in dikaryotic fungal cells, as well as in diploid and polyploid cells more broadly. To engage with students, the fellow will create undergraduate teaching modules on fungal reproduction.

This project will use the highly versatile and social bluebanded goby, Lythrypnus dalli, to elucidate how dynamic social environments alter biology and behavior. The research aims to uncover the restructuring of the brain and gonads in response to external social pressures in these fish, as well as the role hormones have in mediating these changes. Identifying the biological mechanisms behind rapid shifts in a socially complex species is key to understanding how environments shape behavior, hormones, and neurobiology. Project activities will allow the Fellow to further develop as a scientist, mentor, and educator skilled at building learning communities in STEM by working with trainees both within and outside of classroom settings.<br/><br/>This goal of this project is to increase understanding of how the processing of environmental stimuli by the brain initiates neuroendocrine changes, triggers gonadal development, and reorganizes neural networks. L. dalli are marine Teleost fish that live in polygamous social hierarchies comprising of a single dominant male and multiple subordinate female fish. Disruption of these hierarchies causes immediate changes in behavioral phenotypes driven by social contests in an effort to reestablish a stable social hierarchy. For example, in a group with more than one male the more subordinate male naturally transforms into a female, and in a group without a male the most dominant female transforms into a male. The plasticity of these fish in response to changes in their social environment presents an ideal opportunity to investigate the neuroendocrine process of sexual development and adult neurogenesis as mediated by dynamic social environments. This project seeks to better understand how the higher-order social structure of L. dalli affects biological variation as shaped by hormonal environments and social pressures. This work will enhance scientific understanding of phenotypic plasticity at multiple levels of biological organization. This work also enhances trainee participation through instruction of cohort-based research courses and with individual mentorship.

Broadly defined, problem solving involves the mathematical practices in which students engage as they solve intellectually-challenging mathematical tasks. In prior research, problem-solving measures aligned to CCSSM for grades 3-5 were developed and validated to supplement previously established problem-solving measures in grades 6-8. The problem-solving measures assess students? problem-solving performance within the context of CCSSM math content and practices. This project expands the scope of the problem-solving measures use and score interpretation. The project work advances mathematical problem-solving assessments into computer adaptive testing. Computer adaptive testing allows for more precise and efficient targeting of student ability compared to static tests. Few measures designed to assess students? mathematical problem-solving ability use this technology. Shorter tests require less in-class time for assessment than current paper-pencil problem-solving measures and increase classroom instruction time. The computer-adaptive problem-solving measures have sufficient reliability and strong validity evidence, and may limit test-taker fatigue. Finally, the project will benchmark current grades 6-8 instruments using an objective standard-setting method, which allows for improved score interpretations with content-related feedback. Immediate results of student- and class-level reports will be produced through the computer adaptive testing system allowing for teachers to modify instruction to improve students? learning.<br/><br/>This five-year project aims to advance the use of computer adaptive testing and assessment development for use in mathematics instruction. The project applies an iterative and stakeholder-informed design science-based methodology as well as employs the use of Rasch modeling for the psychometric analysis during item development and validation. The project aims to: (a) benchmark the previously established grades 6-8 problem-solving measures; (b) develop, calibrate, and validate criterion-referenced computer adaptive testing for each measure; (c) construct student- and class-level score reports for integration into the computer adaptive testing system; and (d) investigate teachers? capacity for implementing, interpreting, and using the assessments and results in STEM learning settings. The project addresses the following set of research questions: (RQ1) What benchmark performance standards define different proficiency levels on problem-solving measures for each grade level? (RQ2) What are the psychometric properties of new problem-solving measures items developed for the computer adaptive testing item bank? (RQ3) Is there significant item drift across student populations on the new problem-solving measure items? (RQ4) To what extent are problem-solving measures item calibrations stable within the computer adaptive testing system? (RQ5) What recommendations for improvements do teachers and students have for the new problem-solving measures items, computer adaptive testing platform and reporting system, if any? (RQ6) To what extent do teachers interact with, perceive, and make sense of the assessment information generated for use in practice? and (RQ7) Does an online learning module build teacher capacity for problem solving measures, computer adaptive testing implementation, interpretation, and use of student assessment outcomes in STEM learning settings? An experimental design will be utilized to investigate teachers? capacity for implementing, interpreting, and using problem solving measures in a computer adaptive testing system. The project has the potential to impact the field by providing school districts and researchers a means to assess students? mathematical problem-solving performance at one time or growth over time efficiently and effectively; address future online learning needs; and improve classroom teaching through more precise information about students? strengths with less class time focused on assessment.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Habitat destruction and landscape change can cause populations to decline, reducing genetic variation and increasing extinction risk. One mechanism to help endangered populations survive is through gene flow, when individuals from other populations introduce new genetic variation, potentially boosting genetic diversity and lowering extinction risk. However, the relative importance of key factors driving gene flow such as distance, social dynamics, and population size, are not well understood. In addition, the effects of gene flow on traits, survival, and future population growth remain unclear, as the effects of gene flow can be beneficial, harmful, or even change over time. This project combines genomic, trait, life cycle, and environmental data to improve our understanding of the impacts of gene flow across multiple scales and over time. The goal is to provide useful insights for conservation efforts and help predict future outcomes for at-risk populations. As part of this project, the fellow will create educational materials to teach bioinformatics, making complex genetic concepts and skills more accessible.<br/><br/>Gene flow shapes geographic patterns in genotypes, phenotypes, fitness, and population dynamics. This project investigates the multigenerational impacts of gene flow in a wild, pedigreed population of Florida Scrub-Jays at Archbold Biological Station (ABS) with three objectives: (1) determine the factors that drive gene flow from source populations into ABS, (2) identify where in the genome introgressed haplotypes persist and whether their frequency is predominantly driven by drift or selection, and (3) investigate how gene flow impacts phenotypes, fitness, and demography, to predict future trends through simulations. This project will elucidate the causes and consequences of gene flow to lend more predictive power for implementing genetic rescue, a strategy for boosting fitness and population size of endangered populations. The fellow will receive training in pedigree-based population genetics, quantitative genetics, and simulation methods. The broader impacts of this project include informing management and potential genetic rescue of Florida Scrub-Jays and other endangered species alike. The fellow will also lead bioinformatic workshops and participate in local mentorship programs to introduce local high school students to STEM career options, hands-on research experiences, and the ways in which science can have real world implications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are used everywhere these days, from banking and reservation systems to online gaming and social media. Finding and fixing bugs in distributed systems is difficult because bugs can spread across multiple computers and cloud environments, making traditional troubleshooting methods ineffective. A particularly common and challenging to manage type of problems are concurrency bugs that occur when multiple software processes within a program try to access and modify shared data simultaneously. This project introduces an automated tool to help developers identify and fix concurrency issues in distributed systems. It uses innovative techniques to simulate real-world scenarios, uncovers hidden communication patterns, and detects common but difficult-to-find problems. Outcomes from this research will be included in college-level computer science courses on distributed systems and software engineering.<br/><br/>Rust has gained popularity for distributed system development due to its memory safety feature. However, current methods to trigger concurrency bugs in Rust code require substantial human effort and expertise, and effective automated testing tools are lacking. This project addresses these challenges in three ways. First, it will conduct an empirical study of real-world modern distributed systems implemented in Rust to identify current trending issues and their root causes. Second, it will develop a static distributed system dependency analysis and a deterministic simulation testing framework driven by system-level scheduling, enabling automated schedule generation to expose concurrency and other emerging bugs. Third, it will provide an open-source testing platform for public access and future integration. The project will produce a benchmark suite of prevalent and emerging bugs in modern distributed systems to facilitate high-quality bug reproduction. It will also serve as a foundation for future research in improving system reliability and enhance the security of distributed software systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Many successful and diverse groups of animals, such as insects, have segmented bodies. These repeated units can act as ?building blocks? aiding in the evolution of advantageous traits, like new appendage types. However, little is known about the genetic program responsible for segment formation in annelids, the segmented worms (such as earthworms). Additionally, many annelids continue to add segments as juveniles and adults?when they are susceptible to environmental impacts. The main goals of the project are to identify the genetic program responsible for annelids? segmented bodies and examine how resource availability influences segment addition. The project will facilitate new insights into the evolution of animal diversity and has application to other fields including regeneration (of body parts). This work will also encourage the next generation of scientists by including undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>Segment formation has been well studied in arthropods and vertebrates. However, little is known about the developmental genetics of segmentation in annelids. Available studies suggest annelids use a unique genetic program to form segments. Although annelid-specific segmentation candidate genes have been identified, their functions remain unknown. Using Capitella teleta, the project utilizes established gene knockdown techniques to investigate putative segmentation genes. The project also deploys spatial transcriptomics for unbiased identification of novel segmentation genes; top candidates will be perturbed to ascertain segmentation function. The project also examines the segmentation program?s robustness to environmental stressors, identifying impacts on juvenile segment development associated with a resource poor environment. The project expands the fellow?s bioinformatic and functional genomic skillsets; refines their communication and mentoring skills; and broadens their intellectual framework via incorporating multiple life history stages and environmental factors into an evolutionary developmental study. The project will promote STEM by developing a new writing workshop for graduate students, creating a podcast on STEM careers, mentoring undergraduate researchers, and designing a K-12 teaching module on annelids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Behavior is one of the most flexible traits that an animal (or human) can use to help it survive and thrive. But this flexibility can also make behavior challenging to study, especially across levels of biological organization. This project investigates both behavior and the genes that are actively being used in the brain to generate that behavior in three ways. First, how do behavior and brain gene expression change across the lifetime of an animal? Second, how do the brain and the body work together to produce a behavior? And third, how do behavior and brain gene expression change based on what the animal functionally needs to accomplish? Together, what we learn from these aims will enhance our understanding of how brains, bodies, and behaviors function together.<br/><br/>To achieve the above aims, this project will use diverse molecular techniques and a study organism that undergoes major changes in development, develops alternative morphologies and behaviors based on the environment, and displays biparental care: the bull-headed dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. In this species, high-nutrition males develop into large, horned ?fighters? whereas low-nutrition males develop into small, hornless ?sneakers.? In contrast, females develop the same range of body sizes but never grow horns and are behaviorally monomorphic. First, this project will use RNAseq on the brains of fighter males, sneaker males, and large and small females at four different life stages to assess brain gene expression as individuals mature along different trajectories. Second, this project will use RNAinterference to generate morphological mismatches (e.g. females with horns) to assess if and how behavioral repertoires and morphology are linked via brain gene expression. Finally, this project will use RNAseq to contrast brain gene expression in both males and females engaging in the same ecologically critical behaviors?aggression and parental care?to assess the degree to which shared behaviors rely on shared brain gene expression. This project will train the fellow in advanced molecular biology techniques. This project will additionally produce educational resources about animal behavior for middle- and high-school educators and mentor students through summer programs developed to increase STEM participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Kentucky, particularly in the Appalachian region, water distribution systems, which transport water from the point of treatment to the point of consumption, are unique and complex. The various challenges include topography of the region, insufficient revenue from a declining customer base, and decreasing numbers of licensed operators ? the people who work daily to make sure water safely gets to customers. Collectively, these deficiencies have led to unsustainable water infrastructure systems, both in terms of the physical infrastructure and the workforce required to operate it. This project seeks to advance the sustainability of physical water workforce pipelines while strengthening new and existing pipelines for individuals to join the water workforce. This work will identify what drives the sustainability of water distribution systems while simultaneously engaging the workforce who could use this information for decision-making. This work is timely due to unprecedented investments in U.S. infrastructure, which should be capitalized on by prioritizing sustainability to ensure long-term benefits for the physical infrastructure and the workforce needed to design, operate, and manage it.<br/><br/>This project will develop sustainable pipelines ? advancing U.S. water infrastructure sustainability by (1) integrating sustainability assessments into water distribution system planning and management and (2) preparing a sustainability-minded workforce for the nation?s water infrastructure. The first goal ? to integrate sustainability assessments into water distribution system planning and management ? will be addressed by developing life cycle environmental and economic models for water distribution systems and leveraging Kentucky Infrastructure Authority?s existing datasets to evaluate hundreds of systems, identify sustainability drivers, and develop a state-level screening assessment for informed decision-making. The second goal ? to prepare a sustainability-minded workforce for the nation?s water infrastructure ? will take a multi-level approach to water workforce development by engaging new entrants to the workforce through partnerships with prisons in Kentucky and training the current and future workforce in sustainability thinking. This project will advance fundamental understanding of drivers of sustainability for water distribution systems while addressing unique challenges for water distribution systems in Kentucky. Ultimately, this work can increase U.S. economic competitiveness by providing a path to consider long-term sustainability when investing the billions of dollars planned for drinking water infrastructure.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the ENG/CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project introduces novel approaches for developing AI for mathematics, combining neural networks with symbolic, logic-based methods. The project goals aim to achieve a deeper understanding of how AI can learn and reason, as well as how to best combine symbolic and neural approaches. Additionally, the project involves the development of new practical tools that mathematicians can use to formalize mathematical definitions and proofs, enabling proofs to be represented in a digital format so that they can be processed and verified by a computer. The methods to be developed in this project are intended to make the digitization of mathematics easier and more accessible. In turn, this is intended to lead to new paradigms for using, teaching, and learning mathematics, as well as a deeper understanding of mathematics itself. The project is designed to be translational through collaborations with Lean developers as well as with industry. Educational and outreach efforts include developing tutorials on this topic, training students who will contribute to this research, and integrating the proposed research into existing courses. Open-source course material and code will be made available.<br/><br/>The project aims to achieve these goals by pursuing three thematic lines of research. First, the investigators will develop novel techniques that synergistically combine the features of machine learning and symbolic AI. This includes using machine learning for tasks that symbolic methods are unable to achieve and using symbolic methods to produce data and signals that can be used to train neural systems effectively. Second, the investigators will develop new ways of making mathematical understanding explicit with the goal of enabling AI to understand mathematical proofs as well as help humans understand proofs generated by AI. The team will develop novel methods for extracting and learning from symbolic information, inferring the informal reasoning underlying a formal proof, and working with new definitions and lemmas. Finally, the investigators will explore mechanisms for training machine learning systems to carry out focused tasks requiring specific mathematical expertise. The mathematical focus will center on proving inequalities.

Microbes living in the herbivore gut (i.e., the gut microbiome) constitute an important counter-defense, as they can produce enzymes to neutralize plant toxins. However, the mechanisms by which these counter-defenses arise remain severely understudied. When faced with potent toxins, how does the microbiome respond? Does it shift to promote microbial species with pre-existing tolerances, or do the microbes actually adapt? And do these microbiome changes primarily benefit the herbivore or the microbes? To explore these questions, the fellow will compare gut microbiome function, diversity, composition, and adaptation in Madagascar?s bamboo lemurs, which naturally vary in their exposure to dietary cyanide and offer a unique system in which to address these broad questions.

However, to become compatible with mainstream manufacturing processes like casting and forging, the material deposition rate needs to be significantly enhanced. Currently, a substantial amount of thermal energy is concentrated from a single source to melt a large volume of metal powders, which often results in defects and undesirable material properties in the printed components. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research that aims to address this challenge by reducing the thermal gradient in the laser energy input and integrating efficient and cost-effective energy sources, such as induction heat and ultrasonic vibration. By achieving a balanced thermal environment within the process zone, a defect-free high deposition additive manufacturing process becomes possible. If successful, research enabled by this award may transform large-scale manufacturing industries. By providing hands-on exploration and igniting intrinsic motivation, the award is expected to support the workforce development for the nation?s sustainable future in advanced manufacturing. <br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to investigate and control the metallurgical transformation of deposited material during high-deposition rate additive manufacturing processes. Thermal energies from multiple sources, such as laser with beam shaping, induction heating, and ultrasonic vibration, are simultaneously employed onto the melt pool. However, current knowledge in integrating multifaceted thermal inputs to metal additive manufacturing is limited. A critical challenge of additive manufacturing lies in energy delivery to the processing zone, which powers thermodynamic forces, drives metallurgical transformation, and governs the formation of microstructures. These microstructures, in turn, determine the quality of printed parts. The research tasks include: (1) Establishing dynamic control of energy inputs to achieve favorable thermal distribution at the process zone by integrating laser (with beam shaping), induction heating, and ultrasound. (2) Increasing material deposition by preheating the substrate and on-the-fly powders using induction heating. (3) Minimizing residual stress in the part through in-situ induction heat treatment. (4) Developing an AI-based prediction model for microstructure and defect control. The outcomes may facilitate the establishment of a  convergent research and education platform on additive manufacturing research and innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. This project will study how cnidarians and algae form specific partnerships. Many cnidarians form a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide essential nutrients to the host. This partnership is critical for corals, the cnidarians which build coral reefs. Coral reefs are important for the environment and the economy, but the relationship between corals and algae is vulnerable to changes in the environment. One way that corals can survive stressful conditions is by partnering with resistant algae. However, there are limits to which algae can associate with which corals. This research will study the chemical, molecular, and cellular processes that happen when these relationships form, which is important for understanding symbiosis and conserving corals. The fellow will work with a team of scientists and teachers to accomplish research and educational goals. Additionally, the fellow will collaborate with artists to raise public awareness about coral reefs through a dance performance.<br/> <br/>Partner specificity is often conferred by multi-step ?winnowing? mechanisms which select for compatible symbionts out of a diverse microbial pool. In cnidarian-algal symbioses, symbionts are initially taken up through phagocytosis, the same mechanism which initiates feeding and pathogen elimination. Whether these processes are differentiated from one another in cnidarians and distinct from symbiont uptake is unclear, and the mechanisms leading to specificity are unknown. This project will use a comparative approach to uncover the mechanisms leading to specificity during two stages of symbiosis establishment, pre- and post-phagocytosis, by leveraging compatible and incompatible associations in the cnidarian model system, Exaiptasia diaphana. This research will first identify signaling molecules involved in partner recognition prior to uptake (pre-phagocytosis) by characterizing chemical exudates and their regulated pathways among incompatible and compatible associations using metabolomics and transcriptomics. Candidate metabolites identified from these experiments will be functionally tested in an introductory-level Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience to advance research outcomes and increase undergraduate engagement. The mechanisms of symbiont sorting after uptake (post-phagocytosis), and the drivers of these response pathways, will also be characterized by quantifying gene expression, protein localization, and nutrient transfer when inoculated with compatible, incompatible, and heat-killed symbionts. The fellow will gain training in chemical, cellular, and molecular techniques, as well as course development and scientific outreach, through interdisciplinary collaborations at the host institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Nutrient balance is critical for an organism's development, as mismatches between needs and availability can lead to abnormalities and other long-term effects. This project examines nutritional provisioning in amphibians, focusing on the impacts of seasonality and disease. Amphibians are known for having a life cycle with two distinct phases. However, they display many reproductive modes, with more than half of species bypassing the tadpole stage to reduce water dependency. In such cases, eggs must provide the nutrients required for offspring to complete development without supplementation from foraging for food. Changes in food availability and disease dynamics across seasons also affect energy-driven differences in parental provisioning of nutrients to offspring. The fellow will integrate field observations, laboratory experiments, and mathematical models to understand the impacts of environmental change and disease on reproductive traits. In addition to mentoring undergraduate students, the fellow will develop and publish educational materials about amphibian reproductive modes to promote conservation and enhance scientific knowledge. Training in cutting-edge laboratory techniques and science education will enhance the fellow?s competitiveness for a faculty position, contributions to science, and ability to influence future scientists.<br/><br/>Life-history theory predicts trade-offs between offspring number and nutrient reserves. The size of nutrient storage structures is a proxy for nutrient quantity, but offspring success also depends on nutrient composition. By analyzing amphibian oocytes, this project examines nutritional provisioning across amphibian reproductive modes in response to seasonality and infection. It integrates multiple biological levels to profile nutrient composition across individuals and species. The fellow will leverage lipidomics, mass spectrometry, and mixed models to (1) characterize nutrient variability across species and seasons to identify reproductive mode-linked nutrients; (2) compare nutrient profiles of infected and non-infected individuals by controlling diet to identify compensatory mechanisms; and (3) predict amphibian nutritional profiles by integrating data from museum specimens and literature across phylogeny. The results of this project will include peer-reviewed publications, a comprehensive nutrient content dataset, and an R package with a tutorial for analyzing nutrient profiles applicable beyond amphibians. The fellow will train students in lab, field, and analytical techniques and promote discussions on graduate and postdoctoral pathways. Bilingual educational materials on amphibian reproductive modes will be created for schools and shared online, including on NSF Classroom Resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Understanding how bird species adapt to their environment is crucial to knowing how they may be affected by our rapidly changing world. Examples of adaptations include metabolic changes for high altitude survival and cryptic camouflage to remain inconspicuous in various environments. Changes in the genome are often the driving force for these adaptations. These changes range from a single DNA base pair, to more complex structural genetic changes, which can be fifty to thousands of base pairs long. These longer and more complex structural genetic changes are more likely to overlap with genes, leading to changes in DNA function. However, we do not know exactly how these complex structural changes evolve over time. Thus, determining the impacts of structural DNA changes is critical to understanding how species may be adapting to novel and varied environments. During this project, the fellow will also build connections between Biology and Art undergraduate students to generate meaningful science communication pieces for public display.<br/><br/>Much of the work on diversification, speciation, and adaptive potential in birds has focused on the use of specific loci, mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and how they correlate with the environment or phenotype. Structural variants (SVs) include aspects of genome architecture, including chromosomal inversions, insertions and deletions, and transposable elements. These SVs can lead to large regions of the genome that are locked together without recombination. SVs consist of a greater percentage of the genome than SNPs and are more likely to overlap with coding or regulatory regions. However, little is known about whether SVs are directly involved in the speciation process and adaptation. This project aims to comprehensively fill this gap in knowledge by studying the mechanisms behind environmental adaptation and population structure in the Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris), a songbird that has extensive variation in plumage, habitat, and genomic architecture. The fellow will use SVs and SNPs to determine both the interplay of these elements as well as their influence on genome architecture and adaptive potential. This aims to answer the following questions: 1) Which genomic marker type (SV or SNP) best explains population structure? 2) Is the dramatic plumage variation in Horned Lark fueled by structural genomic changes (SVs)? And 3) Do the structural genomic changes (SVs) facilitate adaptation to a local environment? By quantifying all types of genomic variation of a species and generating a new pangenome, this project will form a new model for understanding what genomic mechanisms drive population structure, adaptation, and speciation. The fellow will also work directly with the Bird Genoscape Project to forge connections with conservation partners and integrate population genomics knowledge of bird species, like the Horned Lark, into conservation strategy frameworks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, some insects host symbiotic bacteria that also may further affect their diets. Over millions of years, insect diets have shifted, and these shifts have driven the formation of new species. However, the exact relationship between diet shifts and species formation remains unclear, as does the relationship between bacterial symbionts and host insect diet shifts.

The success of this project will provide approaches that scientists can use to unlock insights into protein behavior that are currently inaccessible, paving the way for advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and materials science. This project also combines artificial intelligence with molecular engineering to train the next generation of researchers, fostering a skilled workforce. If successful, it could significantly accelerate our understanding the dynamic properties of proteins.<br/><br/> This project addresses the limitations of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in capturing the long-time-scale dynamics of protein structures, focusing on the integration of deep learning-based consistency models. MD simulations rely on Newtonian equations with small time intervals (1-2 femtoseconds), limiting their applications from studying milliseconds or longer processes. Consistency models, a recent advancement in generative modeling, offer an alternative by predicting probabilistic distributions of molecular states with significantly larger time steps. The central hypothesis is that well-trained consistency models can replace traditional force fields in MD simulations, enabling long-stride simulations without compromising physical accuracy. The research consists of three primary tasks: (1) developing prototype consistency models trained on MD trajectories of simplified systems like polyalanine peptides, (2) optimizing model architecture and encoding methods to balance efficiency and fidelity, and (3) benchmarking these models on complex systems such as the Pin1 WW domain and A?-42 peptide aggregation. This approach is expected to overcome current MD simulation barriers, laying a computational foundation for studying protein folding, aggregation, and other time-dependent processes with high precision and computational efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to enriching the knowledge base of relevant scientific areas such as photophysics and photochemistry, the discoveries on the fundamental front will likely lead to (1) the development of organic emitters whose emission colors can be tuned by the applied excitation energy in optical devices (e.g., organic LEDs), and (2) new methods of preparing highly functionalized indoles or pyrroles, which are sought after core structures of pharmaceutical drug candidates. This project will provide training opportunities to young scientists who aspire to be well-rounded teachers and innovators in the disciplines of organic and physical chemistry. The special emphasis on sharpening the critical thinking skills of the trainees will help them become problem solvers who will have to address real world challenges with complexity levels that are not defined by disciplines. <br/><br/>In this project, Professor Lei Zhu and collaborating students will uncover the principles that govern the photophysical and photochemical properties of two categories of organic dyes, both of which have access in their electronically excited states to either proton transfer or charge transfer process, or both. The subjects of this project will be prepared, while their properties will be characterized by advanced spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The first category of the targeted fluorescent dyes will be capable of excited state proton transfer to produce excitation energy-dependent dual emission. This is not only a challenging property to produce from small molecular emitters but a potentially useful one, as the composite color or the ratio of two emission bands could then be altered by excitation energy in applications requiring color-shifting emitters. The second category of emissive compounds will contain a triazole core, and many of them are projected to possess high brightness in both solution and solid phases. Depending on the substitution pattern, these compounds will be either photoreactive to be converted to highly functionalized indoles or pyrroles, or photostable. The discoveries on the fundamental front of this project will endow predictive power for assisting the accurate design of dye structures that respond to photoirradiation with either proton transfer or charge transfer process. These processes will in turn trigger the emergence of new properties and functions that are targeted in this project ? excitation-dependent dual emission, or photostable and photoreactive emissive compounds that can be easily prepared.

This research project aims to understand how the brain coordinates these sensory systems to enable goal-oriented movement and stability. Using innovative virtual reality and robotic technology, the research team studies how humans control their movements and balance when interacting with moving objects. The team will develop computer models simulating how different sensory systems work together during these interactions.  This knowledge is crucial for improving human-robot interactions in environments that require physical collaboration.

Camps for high school students include exploration of educational and career opportunities at the intersection of neuroscience, movement science, and robotics. <br/><br/>While the individual sensory processing pathways are well characterized, the mechanisms by which the brain integrates multiple sensory signals to produce complex actions, such as intercepting a moving ball, remain poorly understood. The project aims to elucidate how the nervous system processes visual motion signals to modulate anticipatory postural adjustments and compensatory postural adjustments during interactions with moving objects. The research tests two theoretical frameworks: the feedback error learning model, which proposes that skill acquisition occurs through iterative updating of internal models, and the hierarchical sensory predictive control model, which posits that internal models update intersensory mappings (between vision, proprioception, and vestibular sensation) to regulate motor responses. The experimental paradigm employs a novel virtual reality and robotic system that allows precise control of object motion and contact forces. Participants interact with moving virtual objects while researchers measure smooth pursuit eye movements, muscle activation patterns, and limb dynamics. The experimental design systematically manipulates visual tracking conditions and object motion parameters to investigate how different sensory inputs contribute to motor learning.

To generate accurate predictions of species distribution and persistence it is necessary to understand how mechanisms such as organism interactions and physiological traits shape responses. Seabirds are key consumers in the Southern Ocean, and while changes in their populations have been correlated with environmental modes, the mechanisms underlying these relationships are not well understood. Both ocean and atmosphere conditions are important for seabirds as they forage at sea but breed on land, and changes to wind patterns and Antarctic sea ice location and extent will influence seabird life history. This project focuses on giant petrels (Macronectes spp.), large and dominant avian predators and scavengers that prey significantly on, and influence populations of, species such as penguins and albatrosses. Giant petrels are thought to rely on dynamic soaring for flight, which allows them to use the wind to move while expending little energy. However, quantitative studies demonstrating how giant petrels use wind and the role that wind plays in constraining their distribution are lacking. Also, recent studies suggest that giant petrels may rely on sea ice for foraging, but the impact of sea ice seasonal and temporal dynamics on their population is not clear. Knowledge of the mechanistic links through which sea ice and wind conditions influence giant petrel diet, habitat use, and predation pressure can improve predictive capability for their populations in Southern Ocean ecosystems.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. To better understand Earth's biodiversity, we need to know how complex traits evolve quickly. This project focuses on one such trait-structural white feathers in birds-to learn how it forms, how often it has evolved, and how it affects a feather's function. Feather colors come from pigments that absorb light or from microscopic structures that reflect it. White feathers form when they lack pigment and their microscopic structures are unorganized. This causes them to reflect all visible light, making them look white. After 200 years of research, scientists discovered a special type of white created by organized microscopic structures. Although considered rare, new research suggests it may be more common and could help explain how feather colors evolve quickly. This project will use feather structure analysis, genetic techniques, and ecological data to find out how and why this unique color evolved in three groups of birds known for fast color changes-tanagers, jays, and kingfishers. The project also supports public outreach at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and helps students through mentoring and workshops.<br/><br/>Research into the mechanisms behind rapid phenotypic evolution will provide insights into the proximal (mechanistic) and ultimate (phylogenetic history and natural selection) factors that drive predictable patterns of phenotypic change, a central Rule of Life. Avian plumage is a complex phenotype that has provided many insights into the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution. Previous research has typically focused on easily discernible colors in the human visible spectrum, such as color produced by pigments (brown, red, yellow) or iridescence produced by nanostructures within feathers (structural color). Structural white color, specifically produced by ordered nanostructures within feather barbs, is harder to distinguish in the human visible system and is considered extremely rare in birds. Preliminary investigations by the fellow show that this phenotype may be more common and could be a mechanism for producing novel plumage colors. The project will (1) characterize how structural white is produced and whether it has convergently evolved across three ecologically distant clades, (2) investigate phenotype-environment associations and functional trade-offs of structural white color, and (3) explore lineage-specific molecular adaptations to produce structural white feathers and test for convergent evolution at the genetic level that produce it. Ultimately, this research will shed light on how novel traits emerge and shape species interactions with their environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different genetic types or ?genotypes? of T. gondii have varying impacts on human and animal health, with some genotypes causing severe and fatal disease. Understanding where these genotypes emerge and how they spread at the interface of people, animals, and the environment is vital for protecting human and animal health. The international Network-of-Networks (NoN) will bring together researchers and students from different disciplines and backgrounds investigating T. gondii across the world to create shared tools and research approaches that will advance understanding of zoonotic parasite transmission. As T. gondii infection impacts human and animal populations globally, this project will enhance public and animal health and well-being as well as wildlife conservation. By investing in the development of early-career researchers and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing, our approach will also contribute to the development of a STEM workforce trained in international collaboration and prepared to tackle global challenges in zoonotic disease and public and animal health.<br/><br/>Parasite characteristics, host ecology, and landscape factors can shape T. gondii diversity as well as the emergence of novel genotypes. However, field methods, diagnostic tools, and genotype characterization approaches vary widely across international research groups and geographic regions, limiting understanding of global patterns and processes in parasite transmission and evolution. By integrating three core existing networks and strengthening emerging partnerships with networks, research groups, and consortia focused on different aspects of T. gondii biology, ecology, and epidemiology, this AccelNet Design project will build readiness to launch an international NoN to advance research on parasite transmission and ecology. Existing core networks include the International Network for Environmental Toxoplasma Studies, the Food and Environmental Parasitology Network of Canada, and the Brazilian Toxoplasmosis Research Network (Rede Toxo). The project aims to increase global collaborative research capacity for complex field, lab, and analytic approaches to understand parasite transmission among environments and hosts through 1) an in-person workshop to identify critical knowledge gaps and research needs and to create shared strategies for communication, collaboration, and partnerships among networks, 2) sharing field and lab methods and protocols among networks to facilitate standardization, 3) postdoctoral researcher and graduate student training and exchanges among network laboratories to share knowledge and strengthen STEM workforce development, and 4) harmonizing network approaches for characterizing and sharing field, diagnostic, and genotype data. Building shared field, molecular, and data management and analysis methods, this NoN will accelerate collaborative T. gondii research to advance understanding of parasite transmission at the human-animal-environment interface. Workforce development and global networking efforts will also include developing collaborative virtual and in-person outreach approaches with audiences ranging from healthcare and animal management professionals to the broader public.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current computational methods for studying these dynamics, like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, are limited by their inability to capture long-duration events crucial for understanding processes like protein folding or aggregation. To address this, this project will develop deep-learning models, specifically consistency models, to simulate protein dynamics more efficiently and over longer time scales. These models are expected to predict molecular changes without the tiny time steps required by traditional methods, significantly speeding up the process while maintaining accuracy. The success of this project will provide approaches that scientists can use to unlock insights into protein behavior that are currently inaccessible, paving the way for advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and materials science. This project also combines artificial intelligence with molecular engineering to train the next generation of researchers, fostering a skilled workforce. If successful, the work could significantly accelerate our understanding the dynamic properties of proteins.<br/><br/>This project addresses the limitations of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in capturing the long-time-scale dynamics of protein structures, by  focusing on the integration of deep learning-based consistency models. MD simulations rely on Newtonian equations with small time intervals (1-2 femtoseconds), limiting their utility for studies of processes that take place over milliseconds or longer. Consistency models, a recent advancement in generative modeling, offer an alternative by predicting probabilistic distributions of molecular states with significantly larger time steps. The central hypothesis is that well-trained consistency models can replace traditional force fields in MD simulations, enabling long-stride simulations without compromising physical accuracy. The research consists of three primary tasks: (1) developing prototype consistency models trained on MD trajectories of simplified systems like polyalanine peptides, (2) optimizing model architecture and encoding methods to balance efficiency and fidelity, and (3) benchmarking these models on complex systems such as the Pin1 WW domain and A?-42 peptide aggregation. This approach is expected to overcome current MD simulation barriers, laying a computational foundation for studying protein folding, aggregation, and other time-dependent processes with high precision and computational efficiency.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These predictive capabilities are critical for designing and safeguarding infrastructure, minimizing economic disruptions, and building more resilient communities. The approach will intends to pave the way for better sensor data integration, enhancing understanding of complex geologic conditions and improving risk-assessment tools for engineers and policymakers.

While sensory feedback from the body (e.g., vision, proprioception/kinesthesia) can provide this information, the brain is slow to process it in real time, which means it is always delayed relative to the actual movement. To compensate for this time delay, the brain may generate predictions of the sensory consequences of movement in order to detect and correct errors before the actual feedback information is available. How does the brain combine predictions and feedback signals to form estimates of current and future body state? Elucidating the nature of this process is relevant to many aspects of day-to-day human functioning, such as walking from tile to carpet, working in different gravity environments (air, water, astronauts in zero gravity), and using different types of equipment (gas pedals in cars, computer track pads). This knowledge is also important to neurological conditions, such as stroke, in which the generation of sensory predictions degrades. <br/><br/>This project examines how the brain combines sensory predictions with sensory feedback to estimate the body's state, using subjective reports of the perceived position and movement of the hand (i.e., sensory perception) as a measure of state estimation. The project employs a motor learning paradigm that has participants adapt target-directed reaching movements to a perturbing force field, which causes sensory predictions about reaching movements to update to account for the novel environmental physics. Sensory prediction updates are known to alter the selection of movement commands. In the case of force field adaptation, this produces reaching movements that counter the perturbing force and successfully reach the target. This project compares sensory perceptions before and after this intervention to additionally discern whether and how sensory predictions influence brain estimates of body state. Specifically, this project examines (1) whether sensory predictions influence brain estimates of body position and movement differently, (2) whether sensory predictions influence body state estimates in the same ways that they influence movement command generation (i.e., by assessing overlap in the properties of this influence across the motor and sensory domains), and (3) how the influence of sensory predictions affects brain estimates of the starting point of a movement. This project advances our understanding of the circumstances under which sensory predictions contribute to body state estimates and sensory perception and has the potential to update current models of how these signals influence movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing the complex and global issues that our world faces often requires the collaboration of teams of engineers from across cultural and national boundaries. Working in international and intercultural teams can enhance innovation, but only when engineers have the skills necessary to support such collaboration. This project will study the processes by which students develop the skills needed for success in a global engineering workplace. The project will characterize how this learning takes place in many contexts including programs where engineering students travel abroad (e.g., study abroad, internship abroad) and experiences that do not involve travel (e.g., global courses, domestic internships). Understanding this learning process will support the development of curricular and co-curricular experiences that help all engineering students develop these essential skills, regardless of whether they are able to travel abroad. The project will also produce two online educational modules that can be used to enhance learning in experiential programs and provide workshop and webinar training to educators in how to implement these modules. The research and educational activities in this project support National Science Foundation?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting the professional formation of engineers through the development of an understanding as to how students become global engineers and providing tools to facilitate this process.<br/><br/>This project will characterize the process of global engineering competency (GEC) development by studying travel and non-travel global programs for engineers. The project will address the following research questions: RQ1) What significant events can initiate the process of global formation for engineering students? RQ2) How do engineering students interpret and respond to significant events in their intercultural experiences? RQ3) How do personal, program, contact, and context factors inform engineering students? processes of global formation during intercultural experiences? The project will use a longitudinal video reflection method to collect weekly video reflections from 50 engineering students participating in four categories of experiences: study abroad, global courses at home, internship abroad, and internship at home. These reflections will be analyzed using critical incident analysis (RQ1), a hybrid coding approach (RQ2), and framework analysis (RQ3) to develop a framework describing the process of GEC development. The framework analysis will be grounded in existing theoretical frameworks of GEC and intercultural competence development. The educational activities for the project will focus on the development of two online training modules: 1) Reflecting on Experiential Learning and 2) Connecting Culture and Engineering. All participants in the research study will complete both training modules before participating in their intercultural experiences, and the video reflection data from the research study will be used to evaluate and refine the modules. Two workshops and a webinar will be presented to various faculty audiences to disseminate these modules, which will also be published online as a publicly accessible resource.

A transition from natural gas to clean hydrogen could significantly reduce CO2 production. While gas turbine manufacturers anticipate 100 percent hydrogen utilization in the future, current industrial turbines operate closer to 50 percent hydrogen by volume. One of the main obstacles slowing the transition to hydrogen is flame flashback, a phenomenon wherein the flame proceeds upstream of the combustor with catastrophic consequences. When flashback happens near the wall of a combustor, it is called boundary layer flashback. The addition of hydrogen as a fuel significantly increases the likelihood of such boundary layer flashback phenomena. The goals of this project are to better understand the physical and chemical mechanisms responsible for flashback and to develop general, accurate and affordable models capable of predicting its occurrence. The project also aims to provide rural communities affected by hydrogen projects with a source of information on the impact of the fuel on their lives and to encourage students to participate in STEM starting from high school and continuing through their undergraduate careers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enable a new modeling paradigm for boundary layer flashback of turbulent lean hydrogen flames that allows for general, accurate, and affordable prediction of its occurrence. The primary hypothesis guiding this work is that there is a fundamental relationship between the onset of boundary layer flashback in turbulent premixed lean hydrogen flames and strained premixed flames at the extinction limit, and that this relationship can be leveraged to develop and extend a new class of boundary layer flashback models. As part of this project, direct numerical simulations of boundary layer flashback will be performed to understand the fundamental physical relationship between flashback and extinction limit flames. Insights from these simulations will be used to build engineering models capable of predicting the onset of flashback in a wide range of practical combustors. Finally, wall models will be developed to capture boundary layer flashback in computational fluid dynamics simulations even without fully resolving the flow at the wall.

In contrast to conventional epitaxial lasers, solution-processed devices offer substantial advantages in terms of manufacturing cost, spectral tunability, and compatibility with a wide range of substrates, including flexible and unconventional platforms. Presently, the performance of solution-processed lasers has been hindered by intrinsic optical losses and thermal instabilities in conventional semiconductor nanoparticles. This project addresses these limitations by developing a new class of layered nanomaterials, called colloidal quantum shells, specifically designed to maintain high efficiency under intense lasing conditions. The spherical-shell geometry of quantum shells is aimed at suppressing main energy loss mechanisms and enhancing thermal stability of the emissive layer, thereby enabling brighter and longer-lasting laser emission. The research will explore how to interface these colloidal materials with electrical contacts and optimize light propagation within the laser cavity. The successful demonstration of quantum shell-based laser diodes could result in low-cost, color-tunable, and flexible photonic circuits with wide-ranging technological impact. The project also integrates a strong educational mission, including undergraduate research opportunities, enhanced with the development of an upper level nanophotonics course and a summer research experience program for undergraduates.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/>The goal of this project is to realize electrically pumped laser diodes from a novel class of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, called quantum shells, which structure is designed to withstand the anticipated high energy-density conditions in these devices. The geometry of quantum shells benefits from an effective suppression of the non-radiative Auger recombination processes, which typically cause energy losses in nanoparticles, thus extending both the lifetime and the spectral bandwidth of optical amplification. The research will involve colloidal synthesis of quantum shells, characterization of their excited-state dynamics using ultrafast and single-particle spectroscopies, and their integration into electrically pumped laser architectures. To achieve a low-threshold stimulated emission from solution-processed layers of light-emitting quantum shells, the engineering effort will focus on achieving an efficient charge injection at interfaces and fabrication of resonant cavities that provide strong mode confinement and overlap with the emissive layer. The anticipated suppression of Auger processes is expected to significantly reduce the current density needed to achieve population inversion, while the unique geometry of quantum shells will enable broadband tunability of the emission across both visible and near-infrared spectral regions, including telecommunications-relevant wavelengths. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate high-performance, electrically driven, solution-processable laser diodes suitable for integration into flexible and scalable photonic circuits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these changes is important because Atlantic cod play a crucial role in the Arctic marine ecosystem. Atlantic cod are an essential food source for both marine animals and people. Cod also contribute significantly to the regional economy and cultural identity of Arctic communities. Recent environmental shifts have intensified habitat changes and increased fishing pressures in Arctic regions, impacting species like Atlantic cod and the ecological and economic systems they support. This study uses an innovative technique to track dietary shifts in cod by analyzing chemical signatures in ancient cod bones from archaeological sites. The results will help determine whether the changes in cod?s feeding patterns align with historical increases in fishing, changes in fishing methods, or other natural fluctuations. The outcomes can provide valuable data for fisheries science and policy, supporting efforts to build sustainable fishing practices in response to long-term environmental variability.<br/><br/>This project will use segmental isotope analysis of fish vertebrae (SIAV) to reconstruct high-resolution dietary life histories for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from archaeological sites spanning the last millennium. By analyzing sequential stable isotope values of nitrogen (?15N) and carbon (?13C) in individual vertebrae, this project will trace the trophic positions of individual fish throughout their lives. This approach offers greater detail than bulk stable isotope analysis, which typically provides an average dietary signature that may mask specific ecological events. This research will address two primary questions: 1) Have trophic positions of Atlantic cod populations changed over the last millennium? and 2) Are these changes associated with increased fishing pressure, shifts in fishing practices, or natural environmental variability? Additionally, this project highlights the potential of fish vertebrae as a data source in archaeological studies, providing a new model for analyzing historical and ecological changes across Arctic marine systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach enhances biology assessments by incorporating factors such as competition, resource use, and habitat overlap. The study will leverage previously collected field data and non-invasive genetic samples to refine species classifications and improve network accuracy.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Across the planet, mammals migrate to track seasonal changes in food resources. These migrations allow large populations of mammals to persist in harsh environments where food is seasonally limited. However, it is still unclear what signals migrating mammals use to track changes in food resources. This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict how changing environmental conditions can affect migrations. Many species of mammals use plant odors to locate food and assess food quality, and plant odors also change with season and environmental conditions. This research seeks to determine how seasonal and environmental shifts in plant odors provide cues that inform mammal migrations. The fellow will study whether plant odors are the link between mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) migrations and changing food quality in Wyoming, USA. Mule deer are an ideal species for this study because they effectively track shifts in food quality during spring migrations. By identifying how food quality, plant odors, and mammal movements are influenced by varying environmental conditions, the results of this project will help conserve migrations, which are being lost or threatened worldwide.<br/><br/>The fellow will integrate data from plant chemical analyses, mule deer movement (via camera traps and GPS collars), foraging experiments, and remote sensing methods to address the following objectives: (1) examine if mule deer migratory behavior is related to shifts in the type or total abundance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that plants emit as phenology changes, and (2) discern which plant VOCs provide attractant or deterrent cues to foraging mule deer. The fellow will then develop a predictive model using remotely-sensed vegetation indices, VOC data, climate variables, and mule deer GPS data to determine how environmental variability alters VOC cues and influences mule deer movement throughout entire migratory landscapes. The fellow will expand their research skillset by analyzing GPS movement data via resource selection functions and step selection functions, and by using advanced volatile chemistry methods to collect and quantify plant VOCs. This project will also engage students (ranging from high school to early graduate school) throughout North Dakota in ecological work, and the fellow will provide students with skills and training in wildlife conservation and management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a research and education project aimed at understanding how dislocations move and how their motion affects the deformation behavior of a class of materials known as concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs). In CSAs, different atomic species are randomly mixed in high concentrations, creating locally varied chemical compositions throughout the crystal lattice and spatially fluctuated energy barriers to dislocation motion. These unique atomic-scale features cause dislocations in CSAs to behave differently from those in traditional alloys, leading to mechanical characteristics that are not yet fully understood. This research project integrates statistical theories, computational modeling, and experimental validation to develop a framework for quantitative predictions of dislocation motion in CSAs. By focusing on CSAs made from multiple refractory metals like niobium, molybdenum and tungsten, the project aims to reveal how local chemical fluctuations influence dislocation motion and how these mechanisms shape the strength and plasticity of CSAs. The knowledge being generated could lead to new design strategies for novel refractory alloys with superior mechanical properties and room-temperature processability, addressing critical material needs in industries essential to energy and national security, including nuclear energy, electric power generation, and hypersonic aviation and aerospace. <br/><br/>This project also emphasizes education and outreach to engage students of all ages in materials science and engineering (MSE). It offers hands-on, specifically tailored research training for college students of different grades, introduces high school students to engaging topics in materials science, and incorporates artificial intelligence knowledge into the MSE classroom, with the overarching goal of preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers with the necessary knowledge and skills for developing stronger, more durable materials for future technologies.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports an integrated research and education project to understand dislocation glide behavior and its effect on plastic deformation in concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs). In these alloys, non-dilute atomic mixing introduces inherent fluctuations in local lattice chemistry, making the energy barriers to dislocation glide (i.e., Peierls barrier) vary randomly from one lattice location to another. Consequently, dislocations in CSAs behave distinctively from those in traditional dilute alloys, resulting in intriguing strength and plastic properties that remain poorly understood. By integrating statistical theories, multiscale dislocation modeling, and experimental validation, this project is developing a probabilistic framework for describing Peierls barrier variations and dislocation glide dynamics in CSAs. Using body-centered cubic (bcc) CSAs of refractory metal elements as a model system,  five objectives are pursued: (1) establishing a statistical representation of local chemical fluctuations; (2) predicting probability distribution functions (PDFs) of unstable stacking fault (USF) energies based on the statistical representation; (3) developing probabilistic descriptions of Peierls barriers for different slip systems based on the PDFs of USF energies; (4) elucidating dislocation glide mechanisms using the probabilistic Peierls barriers; and (5) explaining and predicting deformation behavior of bcc CSAs with experimental validation, focusing on brittle-to-ductile transition and activation of slip multiplicity. The knowledge being generated in this project could open new pathways for improving the room-temperature toughness and ductility of bcc CSAs, thereby advancing their applications in industries vital to energy and national security, including nuclear energy, power generation, aviation and aerospace. The statistical approaches being developed are also transferable to the study of probabilistic behavior for crystalline defects in other chemically complex material systems. <br/><br/>This project also includes a significant educational component that ignites passion and cultivates interest in material science and engineering (MSE) among students of various ages. Building on the scientific findings from the research component, the educational component offers multidisciplinary learning and training opportunities for undergraduate students across all levels, sparks early interest in MSE among high school students, and advances the integration of materials informatics into the MSE curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model theory usually studies infinite structures, though, within model theory, there are techniques for taking a collection of finite structures--graphs, orders, groups, etc.--and producing an infinite limit structure that encodes useful information about the finite structures.  For example, there are Fraïssé limits, like the Rado graph or the rational order, which allow for the study of all finite graphs and orders via their rich collection of symmetries, and ultraproducts, which are logical limits that reflect the asymptotic features of a sequence of structures detected by first order logic. Some of the most striking developments in model theory concern the 'smoothly approximable' structures, a special class of structures that can be seen simultaneously as both kinds of limit, which are built out of classical geometries over finite fields and have deep connections to combinatorics and group theory. The geometries that form their basic building blocks also can be considered over infinite fields and are important objects of study in several areas of mathematics. As with the infinite limits of finite structures, model-theoretic techniques allow for the construction of infinite-dimensional limits of these (infinite but) finite-dimensional geometries and new tools are needed to understand them.  This project is focused on the development of those tools. The educational component involves organization of a summer school at University of Notre Dame and  working with graduate students. In addition, the PI plans to work with students in several countries where access to high level math education is more limited. <br/><br/>The PI's research agenda will develop a structure theory for NSOP_1 theories, pushing beyond the reaches of simplicity theory and enabling the treatment of smoothly approximable structures over infinite fields. The name NSOP_1 is an unfortunate label for a very natural class of theories, serving as a kind of 'compactification' of the simple theories and encompassing many important examples. The PI has proposed a two-part program. The first part would develop the 'geometric' aspects of the theory, by analogy with geometric stability theory, with a focus on definable groups and higher amalgamation.  The second part proposes a far-reaching program to expand the reach of the existing structure theory for smoothly approximable structures developed, in its ultimate form, by Cherlin and Hrushovski. In that work, group theory, via work of Kantor, Liebeck, and Macpherson, provided a catalogue of the basic building blocks and classification theory, via the then-nascent theory of simple theories, explained how a smoothly approximable structure is assembled out of these basic pieces. For the analogue over infinite fields, there are significant questions both on the group-theoretic side, concerning the basic geometries, and the classification-theoretic side, concerning a 'geometric' theory of NSOP_1 theories. The PI aims to develop the analysis of geometries in two distinct regimes: the algebraic and the pseudo-finite. This will enable meaningful applications to algebra, representation theory, and combinatorics, particularly to groups of finite Morley rank and to the asymptotic behavior of finite permutation groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Nitrogen is an important nutrient for photosynthetic plants and algae, but there is often not enough of it in natural and agricultural settings. Only a few species of bacteria can take abundant nitrogen from the air and turn it into a form that can be used by biological life. This process is called nitrogen fixation. Because of this, most plants and algae get fixed nitrogen from their surroundings, while some form partnerships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This research will study a rare case in which a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium has become a permanent part of an alga. It now exists as a special compartment called a ?diazoplast.? Having a nitrogen-fixing compartment inside an alga creates unique challenges. The process of nitrogen fixation uses a lot of energy and cannot happen when oxygen is present. Because of this, it must take place in a low-oxygen space. This research will help us understand the mechanisms that are necessary for the evolution of a nitrogen-fixing compartment inside a photosynthetic cell.<br/><br/>The diazoplast relies on metabolites from the host to fuel nitrogen fixation. The mechanisms responsible for metabolite import into the diazoplast and protection of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, from O2 remain unknown. The fellow will identify and test genes of putative importance to diazoplast biology using a combination of cell-based and in vitro assays. The fellow will employ exometabolite mass spectrometry and in vitro biochemistry assays to assess potential involvement in metabolite exchange with the host, and acetylene reduction assays in engineered E. coli and Synechocystis to assess a supportive role in nitrogen fixation, especially in the presence of O2. Finally, the fellow will use phylogenetic tree analyses and distributions of the identified genes in the TARA Oceans database to analyze the possible effects of microbial interactions and horizontal gene transfer on the evolution of these genes. Through this project, the fellow will mentor Community College students in primary research internships.

However, these structural components are vulnerable to buckling during seismic events, which can lead to significant damage or collapse. While restoring the post-earthquake structural integrity of affected buildings is critical for community resilience; however, repairing buckled elements, particularly those with globally deformed cross-sections, remains a significant challenge. This grant for Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) will support research that explores a novel repair technique that combines thermal straightening and reinforcement with basalt fiber-reinforced polymers to restore the strength and stability of buckled cold-formed steel members. By addressing a critical gap in current repair methodologies, this work has the potential to improve post-earthquake recovery efforts, reduce economic losses, and enhance the sustainability of steel structures.

The new methods address a central challenge in the field of survey methods: the widespread problem of survey?taker satisficing. Satisficing respondents provide low-effort responses without sufficiently considering the survey questions. Improving survey estimates benefits a range of disciplines that rely heavily on surveys or experiments with survey-based measures, including the social sciences, public health, and education. The research assists the countless decision makers and organizations that rely on survey data to inform their decision making. The project?s education component invests in the next generation of survey researchers through short courses, software development, and summer research experiences for undergraduates. By forging methodological innovations and training the next generation of survey researchers, the project expands survey methods expertise and produces widely disseminated tools.<br/><br/>This research draws on techniques from causal inference, econometrics, and convex optimization to develop new statistical estimators that are robust to measurement error caused by satisficing. While survey researchers have developed ad hoc techniques, such as attention checks, to try and exclude satisficing respondents from survey samples, these techniques are often detached from statistical theory. This research demonstrates the inadequacy of existing solutions and the necessity of integrating statistical theory and survey design to produce more robust survey estimates. In particular, the investigator works on three main objectives. First, the investigator develops new statistical theory and estimators for common survey data collection techniques that address satisficing though attention checks, panel data, and the like. Second, the investigator extends the new statistical framework to question experiments?where response options are permuted?and by doing so relaxes the strong assumptions needed for screeners or panel data to detect satisficing. Third, the investigator develops new tools to make experiments with survey-based measures more precise despite the presence of measurement error.

Ergodic theory, a branch of dynamical systems, investigates systems that evolve over time, often exhibiting unpredictable and chaotic behaviors. Examples of such systems include planetary motion, weather patterns, and stock markets. Geometry, on the other hand, studies the shape and structure of objects. Ergodic geometry combines these perspectives, using tools from dynamical systems to address geometric problems. For instance, the shape of an object can influence the complexity of certain dynamical systems occurring on that object.  This project aims to deepen our understanding of the relationship between an object?s shape and key dynamical quantities associated with it, such as entropic quantities, which serve as indices of complexity.

Across the U.S., farms primarily use lagoon systems to store and treat manure. Improving lagoon water quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are critical challenges facing the animal agriculture industry. This project combines advanced satellite remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and field-based data collection to better understand the drivers of lagoon conditions and the effectiveness of manure management practices. The outcomes are targeted to support sustainable manure management strategies, reduce environmental impacts, and optimize nutrient recycling. Additionally, the project will inspire the next generation of agricultural professionals through hands-on research opportunities and will provide evidence-based management recommendations to stakeholders.<br/><br/>Promoting sustainable manure management practices requires a comprehensive evaluation of lagoon performance on a regional scale, addressing the current gaps in knowledge due to the variability of lagoon systems across farms and seasons. This project leverages satellite imagery, machine learning, and metagenomics to analyze lagoon conditions and greenhouse gas emissions across diverse climates and farming systems. By constructing a robust database of lagoon characteristics, (1) the study aims to quantify variability in water quality and emissions from lagoons at the state level, (2) assess historical trends in lagoon performance over the past two decades, and (3) identify the key biological, chemical, and physical factors influencing lagoon dynamics. The findings will support the development of decision-support tools for farmers and policymakers, enabling actionable solutions such as nutrient redistribution strategies and optimized lagoon designs and practices. Beyond advancing agriculture and engineering, the project will also provide interdisciplinary research opportunities that train students and contribute to workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But despite its central importance for continental climate and hydroclimate the basic science of soil moisture, at least at regional to continental scales, is not well developed.  There are several reasons for the lack of basic science understanding, among them the complexity of factors that determine soil moisture, including physical climate factors like precipitation and the surface energy available for evaporation, and biological factors that determine how much water is taken up by plant roots and transpired through leaves.  The development of a basic science is also hampered by lack of observations, and by a tendency for research to focus on more applied science issues like the use of soil moisture as an input for subseasonal weather forecasting.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator (PI) of this CAREER award seeks to develop the basic science of soil moisture at regional to continental scales by addressing two questions: first, what are the key controls on the spatial variability of soil moisture in present-day climate? One issue here is why the latitudinal profile of continental soil moisture has a characteristic ""W"" shape, with a maximum at the equator and minima in the subtropics of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Second, how will soil moisture change in a warming world?  The question is motivated by the drying trends found in many of the world's semi-arid regions including the US Southwest, which raise concerns about future water resources as well as increases in the severity of heat waves and the risk of wildfire.  But evidence of a drier future is inconclusive as climate models show subtantial disagreements in their projections of soil moisture change under warming, as well as important discrepancies with the observed record.  Issues to be addressed under this award include why the soil moisture response to warming is muted compared to the precipitation response and what factors determine whether a region gets drier or wetter as a result of warming.<br/><br/>The research questions are addressed through the construction of a hierarchy of soil moisture models starting from the simplest configuration and incrementally adding complexity to determine the most parsimonious version that can account for the behaviours of interest.  The simplest configuration is the model of Stahl and McColl (2022) in which the moisture budget of a thin layer of soil (meaning moisture added by precipitation and removed by evaporation, transpiration, runoff, and drainage) is boiled down to a formula involving only precipitation and sunlight received at the surface.  Despite its simplicity and neglect of important factors such as vegetation physiology the model successfully reproduces the annual cycles of soil moisture seen in a variety of soil moisture regimes over the globe.  Complexity is added to the model through more realistic representations of factors including the nonlinear effects of soil saturation fraction on evaporation, runoff, and drainage.  In addition to the work with simple models, which are compared to observations and climate model output, the PI conducts experiments with a high-resolution atmospheric model (a version of SAM, the System for Atmospheric Modeling, see AGS-2218827) coupled to a land surface model.<br/><br/>The educational component of the CAREER project uses art to teach students about the water cycle and the balance of sources, sinks and storage that accounts for the presence of water on land.  The effort builds on a pilot course developed by the PI in collaboration with the Harvard Art Museum in which students are asked to consider the water balance implications of images of water-dominated and water-depleted landscapes such as the Salton Sea and the surrounding drylands that were, until recently, submerged by it. The course, which is intended for a general audience and requires no specific math or physics background, is scaled up under this award to class sizes of 100 or more and is further developed into a class that can be taught indepedently at other universities. The class is developed so that it can be taught online and also tailored to museums near other colleges and universities, most of which have art work that has appropriate depictions of water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how groups gain or lose territorial control, and thus how conflicts begin, evolve, and end, is essential to national security and preparedness. Yet scholars, policymakers, and military strategists lack reliable and accessible techniques to measure and monitor territorial control within conflict zones. Existing empirical research is focused on a limited number of conflicts for which there happen to exist reliable measures of local-level territorial control over time. This limits ability to understand conflict more generally, and to apply knowledge to new threat environments. This research draws upon open-source information to ensure a transparent process that is easily replicated across contexts and adapted to new measurement challenges. The project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically detect mentions of belligerent activity and control in a corpus of open-source texts, which are then used to produce spatially and temporally disaggregated estimates of rebel and government territorial control. <br/><br/>The Subnational Nonstate Actor Governance (SNAG) project measures nonstate actors? territorial control and governance at the local level, capturing temporal variation throughout conflict, comparable across contexts. This project makes both substantive and methodological contributions, generates new publicly available data capturing nonstate actors? territorial control, uses an approach that translates across contexts to facilitate comparative analyses. The PIs annotate text from a corpus of news reports from conflict zones, identifying indicators of rebel and government territorial control with location and time information. These annotations are then used to train a new natural language processing pipeline, which is applied to the remainder of the corpus to automate the process of extracting relevant information from the full corpus. The information produced by this process is incorporated into a measurement model to produce fine-grained spatio-temporal data on conflict belligerents? territorial control within conflict zones, facilitating systematic comparison of these phenomena within and across conflicts. The subnational territorial control data are used to investigate basic research questions related to the causes and consequences of territorial control and governance, fundamental to understanding the security risks in ?differently governed? spaces, the efficacy of counterinsurgency aid, and the consequences for state-building after conflict. Methodologically, SNAG contributes new tools for generating geospatial data from text and for developing spatial latent variable models adaptable for additional social science applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, robotic technologies have enabled the automation of many tasks that were once dangerous for humans. However, robots are still not advanced enough to navigate many natural terrain types that are either unsafe or not reachable by humans, such as rubble at disaster sites, or sandy surfaces on other planets. In particular, current robotic technologies have largely focused on surface locomotion, and few robots are able to navigate vertically underground, which restricts potential applications, such as grain monitoring for agriculture and soil sampling in remote locations. This research project looks to address this critical gap by integrating techniques in mechanical design and controls to uncover strategies for legged robots to navigate under the surface of loose, sandy substrates. This research seeks to generate knowledge of interaction mechanics within granular media and enable novel robotic capability below ground. Furthermore, this work seeks to expand robotics education in the state of Vermont by engaging graduate students in research, developing new undergraduate robotics curriculum, and fostering strong K-12 robotics programming. <br/><br/>This research aims to elucidate fundamental principles of legged robotic locomotion in subterranean environments, through mechanism design, terramechanics modeling, motion planning, and feedback controls approaches. The project specifically focuses on legged robots due to their potential for multi-modal locomotion. The research looks to first characterize anisotropy in compliant appendage designs with simple actuation and control schemes, with the goal of understanding principles of mechanism design for granular settings. These designs will be implemented on a self-burrowing robot, which will serve as an experimental platform. Using this platform, high-level motion planning will be implemented to determine desired trajectories of the robot given goal positions within the substrate. The work will then incorporate reduced order models for granular media, such as Resistive Force Theory, to determine optimal sequences of appendage gaits which result in the desired trajectories. These model-informed approaches look to generate strategies for closed-loop control which incorporate state estimation subsurface. This project aims for both the design and control approaches to result in more intelligent navigation in a largely unexplored regime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These virtual representations of manufacturing assets enable real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and process planning. However, constructing a DT of a manufacturing system remains a labor-intensive challenge, often requiring manual identification and characterization of production assets. This inefficiency can lead to missing or incomplete representations of key components of the manufacturing system, limiting interoperability and reducing the effectiveness of DT-driven insights. To address this challenge, this Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project supports research that aims to automate the creation of shop-floor DTs using computer vision and deep learning, significantly reducing required human effort while improving DT accuracy. This research project looks to contribute to advancements in smart manufacturing and autonomous systems, with potential extraneous applications in city planning, agriculture, and aerospace. Additionally, the project looks to provide students with hands-on experience in AI-driven manufacturing research and support workforce development in digital twin technologies through new educational programs and outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>This research intends to develop and evaluate a novel framework for fully automated DT generation through three key innovations. First, a dataset of manufacturing shop floor videos will be created and labeled with ISO 23247-compliant annotations of observable manufacturing elements (OMEs), serving as the foundation for training autonomous DT instantiation methods. Next, a neural radiance field (NeRF) model will be developed and trained on this dataset to reconstruct the shop environment as a high-fidelity 3D model. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network will then be implemented to automatically identify and classify OMEs within the NeRF-generated space, eliminating the need for manual asset labeling. Finally, to further automate data collection, commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be integrated with confidence-aware pathing algorithms to optimize video capture and enhance DT fidelity. The project looks to also contribute a first-of-its-kind dataset of manufacturing shop floor imagery, enabling future research in computer vision and digital twin development. By combining NeRF, deep learning, and UAV automation, this work intends to significantly advance the scalability, accuracy, and interoperability of manufacturing DTs while laying the groundwork for broader adoption in smart factories and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, parasites can change the feeding rate of their host. However, few studies have examined how the impacts of parasites on host traits may extend to influence ecosystem function. Testing when and how impacts of common parasites on their hosts scale up will improve our understanding of ecological patterns across scales. This research will use laboratory and field experiments, focusing on the invertebrate, Daphnia dentifera, and two of its common parasites. Daphnia dentifera is important in lake ecosystems, where it plays a key role consuming algae. This Daphnia-parasite system is well-suited for examining the scaling of parasite impacts on important hosts. Furthermore, the fellow will gain training in additional research areas, develop strong interdisciplinary collaborations, and expand science communication programs.<br/><br/>The fellow will measure parasite impacts on traits of multiple Daphnia genotypes during both individual- and population-level experiments. Combining ecological stoichiometry and disease ecology can elucidate how ingestion, assimilation, and release of nutrients change for infected hosts, leading to consequences for primary productivity and nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Conducting these experiments under different environmental conditions will provide insight into different factors that may amplify or dampen effects of parasitism, influencing when parasite impacts are detectable at broader scales of biological organization. With these data, the fellow will parameterize a mathematical model to examine effects of parasites on ecosystem processes, including primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling. Finally, a whole water column lake enclosure experiment will test model predictions and provide insight into conditions in which parasite-driven impacts scale up to the ecosystem level.

However, while the tendency of selection is to increase fitness, new mutations and the random action of drift tend to decrease it, rendering selection less effective and producing populations that are not optimally fit. Although evolutionary outcomes depend on these dynamics, it is unknown how they affect the basic biology of life on earth, even at the molecular level of protein folding and function. The present research thus investigates the consequences of mutation-selection-drift balance for protein stability, a fundamental aspect of protein biochemistry, illuminating the feedback between the dynamic process of molecular evolution and the underlying physical properties of evolving molecules. The results of this research will have implications for modeling, predicting, and directing evolutionary trajectories, important goals for designing and engineering more stable proteins for medical and industrial applications, as well as for understanding the evolutionary process. The fellowship research will produce a large publicly available dataset, and the fellow will engage in outreach and serve as a dedicated research mentor to local community college and university students.<br/><br/>This research will determine the relationship between the thermodynamic stability of proteins (?Gfold) and effective population size (Ne), as changing the latter tunes the evolutionary equilibrium between mutation, selection, and drift.

Mutational trajectories will be characterized in experimental, wild, and in silico populations of different census (and thus effective) population sizes and consequently different mutation-selection-drift equilibria.

Recent estimates of global annual costs of invasive species exceed $400 billion USD, including substantial impacts on people?s livelihoods and quality of life. Non-native species continue to spread rapidly in all biomes ? on land, in freshwater, and in our oceans. Information about the extent of current invasions in our oceans, however, is limited, creating gaps in knowledge that weaken biosecurity efforts aimed at the prevention and management of invasive species. Clear communication pathways for consolidating information on known marine invasions across international stakeholders, and widely adopted standardized protocols for detecting new or undocumented invasions, are needed to tackle this grand challenge and minimize impacts on society. Harnessing complementary expertise across highly invested regional and global networks, the AccelNet BRIDGE program will advance key fundamental science at scales needed to support and inform effective biosecurity policy and contribute to training a skilled US-based workforce, poised to leverage international team science to engage with this challenge. These efforts will make detection of marine invasions more efficient, robust, integrated, and informative across global economies, which is essential for the prevention of future invasions.<br/><br/><br/>The AccelNet BRIDGE program will provide a platform for collaboration and communication, to establish the standardized framework, protocols, and capacity to address critical knowledge gaps at scale that limit invasion science.

This research seeks to understand the ?cost of complexity,? how multiple functions of a gene restrict the gene?s ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This project uses rhodopsins from cyanobacteria (bacteria that harness energy from sunlight) as models of multifunctional genes. Rhodopsin proteins absorb specific colors of light and use the associated energy to pump protons out of the cell as a part of their energy harvesting mechanism. This research hypothesizes that rhodopsins that are forced to maintain their proton-pumping function will be less capable to adapt to absorbing alternative colors of light than rhodopsins that are allowed to lose proton-pumping functionality. Better understanding of this evolutionary principle will bolster scientists? ability to predict how species will adapt to changing environments. Furthermore, the color-adapted rhodopsins produced in this project will enhance cyanobacteria-based biofuel production by capturing a broader range of light. The fellow will participate in community science outreach to help the public understand the impact of scientific research on their lives and mentor undergraduate researchers to help train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>To simulate evolution on a laboratory timescale, mutants of Gloeobacter rhodopsin (GR) will be recombinantly expressed in E. coli. While GR naturally absorbs green light, GR mutants will be challenged to export a fluorescent dye (an assay for proton-pumping activity) while exposed to green, orange, or blue light. The bacteria with the least fluorescence?indicating efficient proton-pumping?will be selected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). These high-performing variants will then undergo further mutation and selection through directed evolution to produce green-, orange-, and blue-adapted rhodopsins with high proton-pumping ability. Once these adapted rhodopsins are obtained, the proton-pumping requirement will be relaxed. The selection step of the subsequent directed evolution cycles will be modified to select for the longest or shortest absorbance wavelength, as appropriate. Populations from every cycle of each directed evolution stage will be sequenced to understand the progression through genotypic space. This correlated genotype-phenotype data will also be used to train a machine learning model to predict functional characteristics of rhodopsins using only previously uncharacterized amino acid sequences. Ultimately, this could enable engineering of cyanobacteria strains capable of harvesting energy efficiently from a wider spectrum of sunlight. The fellow will receive training in phylogenetics, evolution, machine learning, and zoology, while building on their skills in synthetic biology and protein engineering. The fellow will engage in community science outreach and mentor undergraduate researchers. The research will also contribute to the scientific community by expanding the Visual Physiology Database (VPOD) and the Opsin Phenotyping Tool for Inferring Color Sensitivity (OPTICS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project develops innovative methods to measure ""choice process awareness,"" examining how accurately people perceive what influences their decisions. By studying everyday choices in common contexts, we are showing that individuals vary widely in their awareness of choice processes and that increasing this awareness enables people to make choices more consistent with their own stated values. Unlike approaches that impose government or institutional solutions, this work respects individual liberty while addressing costly societal problems where people's actual choices often contradict their conscious intentions.<br/><br/>The research employs a novel ""Awareness of Choice Processes"" (ACP) task that quantifies how aware people are of their decision-making processes and how well these processes align with their personal ideals (a property called ?agentic alignment?). The project consists of five studies examining the relationship between awareness and agentic alignment in value-based choices. Studies 1-2 test whether awareness predicts agentic alignment. Studies 3-4 investigate whether increasing people?s awareness helps them make more aligned choices. Study 5 explores whether improving awareness and alignment in one kind of choice helps people build a generalized skill for being agentically aligned in other kinds of choices as well. This research advances a ""capability"" approach that honors individual autonomy; helping people become more aware of their choice processes enabling them to make decisions consistent with their own values.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will support research that attempts to contribute to the progress of science and the advancement of national prosperity and welfare by introducing and analyzing stochastic models at the level of interactions between customers and service providers, rather than via traditional system-level models. By capturing micro-level details that were previously overlooked, this project intends to address novel and societally important operational problems in the service sector, offering to recover wasted time and improve customer outcomes without additional resources. This project aims to improve managerial decision making, introduce new operational problems, and generally open novel avenues of analysis specifically for services. In its education plan, the award aims to expose students to modeling and quantitative reasoning through the development and dissemination of instructor-facing tools for integrating artificial intelligence and data science in undergraduate business education. As undergraduate business students comprise an extensive and representative population of future team members and leaders of the Nation's commercial enterprises, their understanding, involvement, and support of modeling can improve the overall quantitative literacy of the workforce and public, advancing the scientific and industrial competitiveness of the nation. <br/><br/>Towards these aims, the research objectives of this award are to establish and analyze stochastic models of service at the level of interactions. In traditional queuing theory, a service time is viewed as a realization of a single random variable.  However, service interaction data reveals that this perspective is too coarse: it overlooks the facts that (i) each service interaction is composed by a unique collection of multiple contributions, and (ii) these contributions come from two distinct and interacting sides, the customer and the service agent.  This project?s interaction framework views service time not as a single random variable, but rather as a finite point process (modeled initially as a Hawkes process) of contributions driven by its history.  The random variable describing service duration can arise in two different ways: either at the moment of the final contribution (if the service closes ?naturally?) or at a stopping time on the filtration of the point process (if the service must be closed ?systematically?).  By moving from the prevailing macro-level perspective to the micro, these interaction models will identify and solve a new class of control and design problems and also re-contextualize classic approaches to these managerial decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Many animals rely on gut microbes to break down toxins in their plant-based diet. In some insects and mammals, this ?microbial facilitation? also helps detoxify ingested pesticides and pollutants. Release of human pharmaceuticals into the oceans has raised concerns about toxic effects on filter-feeding organisms like mussels, which cannot escape toxic stress. This research will investigate how the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and its gut microbiome interact to break down a toxic pharmaceutical pollutant. Understanding how microbial breakdown of pollutants affects mussel health will improve predictions of how bivalves will adapt to more foreign substances in their environment. Detoxifying microbes in the gut could help mussel populations tolerate toxic threats and position microbiome health as a key concern in their conservation and aquaculture. Undergraduate research mentorship and career pathway development constitute key broader impact activities.<br/><br/>The research will involve three major approaches using the pharmaceutical contaminant carbamazepine (CBZ), which accumulates in and is toxic to marine bivalves. Mussels from a CBZ-free habitat will be exposed to a range of CBZ concentrations in microcosms, and the tolerance of the mussel and its gut microbiome (combined ?holobiont?) assessed. Next, gut microbiomes of mussels from CBZ-polluted habitats will be diminished with antibiotics, and animals will be exposed to CBZ in the laboratory. This approach will demonstrate to what degree a functioning, healthy microbiome assists in CBZ detoxification, and implications of disturbing this microbiome on the health of the mussel under CBZ stress. Lastly, the fellow will investigate how simulated predation stress in mussels from CBZ-polluted habitats could affect the holobiont?s susceptibility to CBZ toxicity. Molecular and physiological markers will be used to assess mussel health, and DNA and RNA sequencing of the gut microbial community will be used to identify taxonomic shifts, detect functional responses to CBZ, and recover genomes of potential CBZ-degrading microbes. Research and training activities will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of bivalve health and resilience in polluted environments.

Understanding how groups gain or lose territorial control, and thus how conflicts begin, evolve, and end, is essential to national security and preparedness. Yet scholars, policymakers, and military strategists lack reliable and accessible techniques to measure and monitor territorial control within conflict zones. Existing empirical research is focused on a limited number of conflicts for which there happen to exist reliable measures of local-level territorial control over time. This limits ability to understand conflict more generally, and to apply knowledge to new threat environments. This research draws upon open-source information to ensure a transparent process that is easily replicated across contexts and adapted to new measurement challenges. The project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically detect mentions of belligerent activity and control in a corpus of open-source texts, which are then used to produce spatially and temporally disaggregated estimates of rebel and government territorial control. <br/><br/>The Subnational Nonstate Actor Governance (SNAG) project measures nonstate actors? territorial control and governance at the local level, capturing temporal variation throughout conflict, comparable across contexts. This project makes both substantive and methodological contributions, generates new publicly available data capturing nonstate actors? territorial control, uses an approach that translates across contexts to facilitate comparative analyses. The PIs annotate text from a corpus of news reports from conflict zones, identifying indicators of rebel and government territorial control with location and time information. These annotations are then used to train a new natural language processing pipeline, which is applied to the remainder of the corpus to automate the process of extracting relevant information from the full corpus. The information produced by this process is incorporated into a measurement model to produce fine-grained spatio-temporal data on conflict belligerents? territorial control within conflict zones, facilitating systematic comparison of these phenomena within and across conflicts. The subnational territorial control data are used to investigate basic research questions related to the causes and consequences of territorial control and governance, fundamental to understanding the security risks in ?differently governed? spaces, the efficacy of counterinsurgency aid, and the consequences for state-building after conflict. Methodologically, SNAG contributes new tools for generating geospatial data from text and for developing spatial latent variable models adaptable for additional social science applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the leading single photon detection technology owing to their near-unity quantum efficiency, higher count rates, extremely low dark counts, and high timing resolution. However, most state-of-the-art SNSPD detectors operate at very low temperatures (< 4 K), necessitating extensive cryo-cooling. Here, we propose utilizing high-temperature iron-based superconductors such as Fe(Te, Se), which is known to exhibit superconductivity up to 65 K at the monolayer limit, to advance single photon detection technology. This project aims to develop SNSPDs that operate at temperatures above liquid helium, significantly reducing the footprint and enhancing accessibility and scalability. The project's success could advance the quantum technology revolution due to its higher working temperature regime, which may have critical applications in biomedical research, deep space imaging, and optical-quantum computing. Developing next-generation high-temperature SNSPDs will advance quantum technologies (National Quantum Initiative Act 2018) and integrated quantum photonics (CHIPS and Science Act, 2022).

These crystals play a vital role in daily life: from helping to transform promising pharmacueticals into bioavailable tablets to allowing scientists to explore how the building blocks of cells function using crystallography experiments. For small molecules with just a few dozen atoms, computational methods can predict packing into different crystalline structures called polymorphs?each with unique properties such as stability and water solubility. But for larger, more flexible molecules?like proteins or new drugs with hundreds or thousands of atoms?this prediction becomes far more difficult. Schnieders and his team will tackle this challenge in two key ways. First, they?ll create a method?up to 100 times faster?to determine which crystal polymorph is most stable by simulating how crystals shift from one form to another. Second, they?ll integrate acid/base chemistry into their models to better capture how molecular crystals are influenced by pH. These breakthroughs could speed up the design of new therapuetics and help uncover enzymatic mechanisms. Beyond the lab, Schnieders will spark interest in science through a high school internship program, train graduate students in cutting-edge computational skills, and share the software developed to support these efforts , Force Field X, freely with the scientific community.<br/><br/>Organic crystals are essential for developing bioavailable pharmaceuticals and studying biomolecular structures via crystallography. Molecules within a crystal can form multiple polymorphs, each with distinct properties like stability and solubility, making accurate prediction of observed polymorphs critical. Current methods for estimating free energy differences between polymorphs rely on inefficient approaches, such as the Einstein crystal method, which involves summing large, opposing free energy terms. Schnieders will develop methods to overcome this by introducing a novel dual-topology approach for solid-solid phase transitions, enabling direct, efficient estimation of relative free energies between complex crystal polymorphs with equilibrium sampling methods. For protein crystals, Schnieders will advance molecular simulations by integrating charge penetration, charge transfer, and neural network terms into polarizable atomic multipole models, enhancing the treatment of (de)protonation via constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD). These innovations will improve the accuracy of crystal structure prediction and deepen insights into protein behavior.

Students with special needs, who are often in general or regular education environments for mathematics instruction, are especially impacted because they may have a lower likelihood of meeting graduation requirements or later accessing college courses in STEM fields. This project aims to understand how school districts in Utah conceptualize effective mathematics instruction. The project also aims to refine the process through which pairs of general and special education teachers of mathematics at the same school collaborate and participate in the project related research activities. <br/><br/>This project at Utah State University includes partnerships with specialists in and teachers of secondary mathematics instruction in both general and special education at the Utah State Board of Education and Cache County School District. Project goals include (a) strengthening collaboration between faculty in the Mathematics and Statistics Department and those in the Special Education and Rehabilitation Counseling Department; (b) developing a broad understanding of mathematics effectiveness across school districts in Utah to establish a measure of teacher effectiveness; and (c) piloting recruitment strategies to include a general and a special education mathematics teacher from the same school in research. The project will achieve these goals by implementing two research projects. The first project consists of a state-wide survey to get an overview of types of mathematics instruction, views on effective mathematics teaching, and the use of collaborative teaching models between secondary general and special education mathematics teachers. The second project includes a mixed-methods social network analysis focused on personal and professional support systems, collaboration, and intent-to-stay of pairs of secondary mathematics teachers in general and special education settings within the same school. By studying the effectiveness and retention of secondary general and special education mathematics teachers, this project has the potential to improve the quality of life of students. Through being taught by effective and experienced teachers, these students may increase their completion of STEM graduation requirements and college preparation courses. As a result, more students may have the opportunity to pursue STEM careers and enter the STEM workforce. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. This research will improve our understanding of how pathogens evolve. More clearly than ever following the COVID-19 pandemic, pathogens can evolve extremely rapidly with global impacts. One of the most important ways that pathogens evolve is in their virulence, the harm they inflict upon their hosts. Understanding and predicting how pathogen virulence will evolve is paramount for fields from vaccine design to epidemiology, agriculture, and healthcare. The evolution of virulence can be shaped by numerous factors, but one of the most important factors that every pathogen interacts with is the host?s immune system. This project will test how immunity influences pathogen evolution, using experimental and simulation methodologies to build a predictive understanding of how pathogen virulence is shaped by the host immune system. The results of this research have broad implications, including for public health. This fellowship will also support mentorship, training, and education for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>To test how immunity influences pathogen evolution, this project will use mathematical models and laboratory experiments. It aims to answer two questions: 1) how do different parts of the immune system individually shape pathogen virulence evolution, and 2) how does variation in immunity between hosts in a population shape pathogen virulence evolution. To answer these questions, this project leverages an extremely powerful laboratory model system: Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. These nematodes are easy to experiment with, and their innate immune system shares many similarities with mammals. In this research, C. elegans will be experimentally infected with a widespread bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to directly observe how Pseudomonas evolves depending on the immune state of C. elegans. Experimental measurements will be integrated with mathematical models to directly test how well model predictions match experimental outcomes. Through the course of this fellowship training, the fellow will develop expertise with C. elegans-bacteria systems, build essential bioinformatic skills, and gain experience with evolutionary modeling. The broader impacts of this project include potential applications in public health policy and vaccine design, mentorship and hands-on research training for undergraduate students, development of a peer mentorship program for graduate students, and instructional modules that integrate research into undergraduate education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses a fundamental evolutionary question in biology: how did environmental forces shape the emergence of animals from unicellular ancestors? To explore this, the fellow will study choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals. Despite their evolutionary significance, research on choanoflagellates has been largely limited to a few model species. This project focuses on the evolutionary adaptations of Barroeca monosierra, a recently discovered multicellular choanoflagellate isolated from Mono Lake, California, and its novel internal microbiome, to extreme environmental conditions. The findings will provide insights into how choanoflagellates evolve complex interactions with their environment and microbial partners, shedding light on early host-microbe relationships that may have influenced the origin of animals. Additionally, this work has broader implications for conservation and biotechnology, with potential applications in microbial stress resistance and bioremediation.<br/><br/>This research will examine how environmental stressors drive adaptation and symbiosis in B. monosierra, focusing on high salinity, arsenic, and cyanide. To achieve this, the fellow will use an interdisciplinary approach, investigating B. monosierra in both its natural habitat and controlled laboratory settings. The project will integrate fieldwork, metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses, microscopy, and gene-editing techniques to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms that enable B. monosierra to survive in extreme conditions. Moreover, the project will characterize the microbial communities associated with B. monosierra, and identify key adaptive pathways involved in environmental resilience. Through this research, the fellow will gain interdisciplinary training in microbial ecology, molecular biology, computational genomics, and field ecology. Broader impacts will include community outreach through educational partnerships with the Mono Lake Committee and local schools, as well as creative science communication initiatives.

This research focuses on the dynamic interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, particularly within the turbulent magnetosheath. By analyzing this environment, we aim to enhance our knowledge of how plasma conditions evolve across boundaries especially in inaccessible regions in the universe such as the heliosphere interface with the interstellar medium, and supernovae remnants. The project is significant as it addresses key challenges in space physics, including the complex interplay of nonlinear interactions and the multiscale nature of turbulence, which remain difficult to model and simulate. This project will also contribute to developing novel algorithms for the upcoming era of multiscale multispacecraft missions. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, this study employs a combination of theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, and spacecraft observations to investigate plasma turbulence in the vicinity of Earth?s bow shock. The interaction of the solar wind with the bow shock produces a downstream region (the magnetosheath) with unique properties. It is a very turbulent medium of limited size where the dynamical evolution of the recently shocked solar wind can be investigated. The research focuses on three primary objectives: (1) extending our understanding of the inertial range of turbulence, (2) measuring energy dissipation rates, and (3) characterizing equilibrium states that emerge in turbulent flows. We utilize advanced multispacecraft techniques, such as the Lag Polyhedra Derivative Ensemble (LPDE), alongside high-resolution data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and hybrid particle-in-cell simulations using the Menura code. The results will provide a more comprehensive picture of turbulence across planetary magnetospheres and interstellar boundaries, contributing to the broader field of space plasma physics and informing future space missions like HelioSwarm, PUNCH, and IMAP.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Practical applications include picking up objects from cluttered tables, clearing disaster debris, and rescuing marine life trapped in abandoned fishing gear. These advancements will benefit multiple sectors of the US economy, from fisheries to household consumer goods. As industries increasingly rely on robotic systems for tasks in outdoor spaces, crowded areas, underwater environments, and other unpredictable settings, the ability to grasp moving or cluttered objects becomes essential. Failures are inevitable, so effective recovery strategies are crucial to improving the overall success rate of robotic grasping. However, current techniques often struggle to adapt after a failure occurs, limiting their reliability. Beyond research, the educational impact of this project includes several activities such as providing undergraduate students at Oregon State University with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in robotic grasping and introducing K-12 students to search-based planning concepts by collaborating with local school robotics clubs in Oregon. Additionally, the project team will demonstrate grasping algorithms on a physical robot to enhance the daily experiences of residents with dementia at the Grace Center for Adult Day Services in Corvallis, Oregon.<br/><br/>This grant aims to provide fundamental algorithmic contributions to heuristic search-based planning under uncertainty, specifically for addressing grasping failures caused by different factors, primarily: (1) unknown object parameters such as mass and friction coefficients, (2) unknown dynamics of a moving object, and (3) unknown scene segmentation and interaction dynamics in a cluttered environment. The goal is to improve the grasping success rate and reduce the number of attempts required to achieve a successful grasp while ensuring real-time planning speed and theoretical guarantees. The core premise of this work is to compute policies, rather than plans, for failure recovery. The key insight is to develop conditional policies that account for anticipated failure outcomes of a grasp, where each outcome explicitly minimizes the probability of failure for subsequent attempts. The PI will involve learning dynamic Bayesian networks, deep neural networks, and hybrid models to enhance generalizability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extensive work has been devoted to controlling PNP formation using emulsion polymerization, controlled precipitation, liquid/liquid phase separation and templated self-assembly. Polymer crystalsomes, as a class of newly discovered PNPs, refer to hollow nanoparticles where the particle shells are formed by polymer single crystals. Compared to conventional PNPs, polymer crystalsomes show excellent mechanical and unique thermal properties and offer facile control over their size, shape, and chemical composition. Hollow polymersomes with sizes ranging from ~ 100 nm to microns can be readily fabricated. This project aims to systematically investigate the formation process of these newly developed polymer crystalsomes by using three model emulsion systems. Knowledge achieved through this project will help to understand crystalsome growth and enable the fabrication of complex PNPs for current and new applications. This project also offers opportunities for mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and developing new course modules. The results will strengthen various outreach activities such as summer materials science camps.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Polymer crystalsomes are a class of hollow PNPs with single crystal shells, and they are typically grown using a nanoemulsion-solution crystallization system. While a series of polymer crystalsomes have been successfully grown using homopolymers and block copolymers, understanding the formation process remains elusive. This lack of clarity exists because the nanoemulsion-based crystalsome growth is complex, including interwoven processes such as emulsification, liquid/liquid phase separation, and polymer crystallization. The proposed work will be undertaken to systematically investigate the formation process of crystalsomes. To establish a detailed understanding of the crystallization process in nanoemulsions, this project will develop a new scientific framework of dynamic confinement in polymer crystallization, in which polymer diffusion into and out of the crystallization system is allowed and controlled to program the crystallization process in nanoemulsions. Three model emulsion systems, including oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions, water-in-oil (W/O) nanoemulsions, and quiescent nanoprecipitation (?Ouzo emulsions?), will be employed in this study. These complementary systems will be used to tune the dynamic confinement and polymer phase separation process in the system. Furthermore, a library of complex polymer crystalsomes will be fabricated with controlled characteristics, such as size, opening, curvature, and function. The project, therefore, will advance our fundamental understanding of polymer crystallization under dynamic confinement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soft viscoelastic materials, such as polymers, hydrogels, and biological tissues, are integral to engineering and biomedical applications. However, their fracture behavior remains insufficiently understood, particularly under extreme loading rates and temperatures. Current fracture models primarily address slow-loading regimes, failing to capture the nonlinear, rate- and temperature-dependent fracture processes these materials undergo.

The results of this research look to have significant interdisciplinary impact, advancing mechanical and biomedical engineering fields, and contributing to applications in protective materials, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. Additionally, this CAREER project will provide research opportunities, curriculum development, a student symposium, K-12 outreach, and industrial and medical collaborations.<br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER project is to develop innovative full-field experimental techniques and a unified theoretical and computational framework to understand fracture mechanics and material failure in nonlinear viscoelastic materials across diverse loading conditions.

It is well known that external factors are important in driving cooperative behaviors: people cooperate to avoid punishment and to maintain positive reputations. However, these external factors do not provide a full account of the variables influencing cooperative behaviors. This project tests the hypothesis that cooperative decisions are also driven by internal motives and that childhood represents an important period during which these internal motives are acquired. Broader impacts of this project include new insights into fostering cooperative behaviors, research training for early-career scholars, and wide dissemination of research products with the research community and broader public.<br/><br/>The central idea guiding this research is that the norms that govern cooperative behaviors become integrated into children?s developing sense of self. As part of this process, children become motivated to cooperate because they come to view cooperative behaviors as valuable in and of themselves, and increasingly central to their identities. In a series of studies with 5- to 10-year children as well as adult participants, the research team uses longitudinal behavioral methods, computational modeling, and trajectory tracking of participants? motor movements to examine developmental changes in cooperative norms and behaviors. Results of this project hold potential for both theoretical advancements and practical insights into cooperative behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, with an explosive growth of information and communication technology, involving artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and big data, this approach faces fundamental obstacles. Modern computers rely on so-called multicore architecture with a complex network of interconnects, establishing communication between different computer parts, including their logic and memory, for processing and storing information. The key concern in computers is their power consumption, dominated not by the transistors and information processing, but rather by interconnects and information transfer. In a simple analogy, transistors can be viewed as cars and interconnects as highways. Replacing an older car with a luxury vehicle in a traffic jam will not make much difference. Instead, it is crucial to design better (information) highways. Lasers and optical interconnects are closely intertwined, with lasers acting as the light source for high-speed data transmission and communication (interconnects) in fiber optics and other systems. They enable faster and more efficient data transfer in areas like data centers and other applications needing high bandwidth. Thus, this transformative research seeks to develop new principles for their ultrafast and energy-efficient operation. Specifically, instead of conventional lasers which transfer information by the corresponding changes in the intensity of the emitted light, this research proposes to take advantage of the much faster changes in the polarization of the emitted light. With the preliminary experimental demonstration of this principle, completed by the recent breakthrough that the polarization of the emitted light is electrically controlled at room temperature in light-emitting diodes, the proposed research envisions superior performance by seamless integration of processing, transferring, and storing information.<br/><br/>Controlling the intensity of emitted light and charge current is the basis of transferring and processing information. In contrast, robust information storage and magnetic random-access memories are implemented using the electrons? spins and the associated magnetization in ferromagnets. An unequal number of spins along or against the magnetization axis represents the binary information ?0? and ?1? which, as the magnet attached to the fridge door, can be preserved without external power. While commercial spintronic devices rely on the change of the resistance with the spin orientation--magnetoresistance, by taking electrons out of ferromagnets the spin information is quickly lost (within nanosecond) and cannot travel far (typically, up to a micrometer). However, since the light also has spin through its circular polarization or helicity, the spin information transferred from electron to light, could be carried much faster and farther. The proposed research builds on the breakthrough of switching the magnetization of a ferromagnet in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at room temperature and no applied magnetic field. Through the conservation of the total angular momentum, switching the magnetization of the ferromagnet reverses the orientation of the injected spin and the corresponding helicity or handedness (left vs right) of the emitted light. This principle is used to predict the operation of spin-controlled LEDs and lasers, with potentially transformative implications for processing, transferring, and storing information. The device modeling will combine first-principles studies, generalized rate-equation description, and microscopic optical gain calculations. This effort will be complemented by implementation of these devices, pursued by the experimental collaborators and using commercial materials for magnetic memories. The proposed research will be supported by closely integrated educational and outreach efforts, as well as by developing resources for newcomers interested in spintronic devices beyond magnetoresistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It demonstrates the utility of these data by exploring a set of sociological hypotheses, and sustainably archives them for future generations. The AMDs, periodically published by the American Medical Association from 1906, present an immense opportunity to illuminate the organizational dynamics of professional medicine in the early 20th century. In addition to physicians? names and practice locations, these volumes also contain valuable information about individuals? training histories and medical specializations, demographic characteristics, and membership in state and local societies. Because AMDs were published triennially, they also present an opportunity to link individuals over time, exploring physicians? movement between regions, as well as how and where training pipelines for the medical workforce developed. No other data source offers such nuanced, individual-level information about the early medical workforce, yet the AMDs remain underexplored archival sources, largely due to the difficulties of extracting large quantities of data from original archival sources. Additionally, public-facing outputs and activities of the project bring its utility to a broader audience, enabling still further kinds of non-academic inquiries and applications.<br/><br/>This project centers on a critical period of history in professional medicine and captures significant demographic and cultural moments that likely interrupt previous patterns, including the Flexner Report, Great Migration, and World War I. Specifically, the project: 1) delivers a novel, publicly-accessible, longitudinal physician database, extracted from purposively selected editions of the AMD between 1906 and 1938; 2) links these records to other relevant historical data sources, including decennial Censuses, leveraging existing NSF-funded data infrastructures; 3) tests specific sociological hypotheses related to practice markets, growth patterns, physician migration, and specialization to demonstrate the dataset?s utility; and 4) engages broader audiences through data visualization, media, and public events. The project enables interdisciplinary quantitative and mixed methods analyses that previously were limited by the inaccessibility of AMD records, and provides a ?gold standard? version of extracted records that could be used in future efforts to extract data from additional AMD editions. By building a novel, longitudinal dataset of the medical workforce between 1906-1938, the project provides a through-line from the early days of professional medicine in the US, and, critically, makes a trove of physician-level data accessible to social science researchers and the broader public.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Sociology Program and the Human Networks and Data Science-Research (HNDS-R) Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This act feels automatic and simple, but cognitive science suggests it is enormously challenging. Every talker says these same sounds a little differently, and they sound different in different contexts. Thus, the auditory system must do a lot of work just to identify these basic sounds. This is particularly important in the context of learning language and reading. Children can?t recognize a word like ?beach? if they can?t identify the ?b?s? and ?ee?s? and ?ch?s? that comprise it. More importantly, when learning to read, children must learn the complex mapping between letters and these auditory categories?that have to learn that a letter string like EE, EA or Y can make the ?ee? sound. If the auditory process is not working effectively, learning these crucial phonics skills will be hard. Supporting these points, much prior research has linked differences in how listeners categorize speech to real-world concerns including development, language and reading disorders, second language learning, and aging.  <br/><br/>This project builds on previous work in significant and novel ways. The study team?s prior work has led to a simple new way to assess these skills in which people hear sounds that have been morphed from one to another and rate them on a continuous scale. This new task has revealed a surprising new dimension to the problem of individual difference in speech perception which is, the degree to which a people?s percept is stable across multiple encounters with the same sound, or consistency. Consistency changes with development. It is linked to both reading and language disorders. It predicts 30% of the variance in overall language ability in adults.  One part of the project investigates the nature of categorization consistency, by asking whether it reflect general cognitive tendencies, noise in the auditory system, or something specific to speech, looking at both children and adults and relating consistency to real-world variation in language and reading ability. Another part of the project develops a new eye-tracking paradigm and asks if the language system has ?clean-up? mechanisms that leverage higher level knowledge to enhance consistency to cope with noise in the auditory system and asks whether variability in clean-up mechanisms explain differences in language and reading ability. The broader impacts of the project are to develop real-world interventions that apply this knowledge to reading disorders. As a first step towards this eventual translation, the project focuses on bridging the gap between cognitive science and the classroom, a key issue in the public discussion over the ?Science of Reading?. The study team, which includes cognitive scientists and education researchers, are teaching a semester-long workshop intended for students from both disciplines. In this class, students design a new assessment of categorization consistency ? consulting with private sector partners ? and field-test it in local schools to gather real-world data, as well as teacher and student insights.  This activity will pave the way for a potential real-world application of the basic research.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Perception, Action and Cognition (PAC) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, humans struggle to create such structures due to limitations in today?s manufacturing technologies, which cannot align composite materials in 3D space. The overall aim of this Future Manufacturing Research Grant (FMRG) award is to realize a future cybermanufacturing platform that is capable of precisely controlling the 3D orientation of multi-material systems. This award supports creation of the ?Anisotropic Multi-Axis Layerless Additive Manufacturing? (AniMAL AM) system, which looks to leverage robotic arms outfitted with material extrusion tools that are driven by multi-axis printing toolpaths to enable volumetric, spatial control in composite materials. Controlling the organization and orientation of functional composite materials within a part could enable an estimated 10x structural and 70x thermal improvement over conventional additive manufacturing technologies. This looks to transform industries requiring tool-less fabrication of lightweight, multifunctional structures?such as aerospace and automotive?by reducing costs for complex parts while significantly enhancing performance. The award will also introduce, prepare, and grow a future workforce with the convergent skills required for future manufacturing careers.<br/><br/>AniMAL AM represents a fusion of advanced technologies: a layerless, multi-axis 3D printing process that orients materials in different directions throughout a part volume, machine learning-enhanced design optimization, and a pair of material and process digital twins to simulate and control the manufacturing process at both mesoscopic voxel-level inclusion orientation and macroscopic part topology. AniMAL AM looks to enable a future manufacturing process to design, fabricate, and validate multifunctional composite structures with voxel-level inclusion orientation with improved performance and robustness. This seeks to yield new (1) understanding of the shear-induced orientation of dynamic inclusions during extrusion, (2) methods for planning robotic poses for multi-axis toolpaths, (3) approaches for quantifying uncertainty from multiple sources, and (4) topology optimization that accounts for multiaxis manufacturing constraints and treats voxel orientation and inclusion morphology as design variables.  Integrating this research with strategic outreach and experiential learning activities looks to prepare a next-generation workforce to leverage these breakthroughs to revolutionize the manufacturing of advanced composite systems and improve performance across varied applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to create robots up to one hundred segments long, which would more than double the current state of the art. More segments and joints increase the number and complexity of different shapes that the robot can form. This is important, for example, in manufacturing tasks like inspecting the highly contorted and tightly confined space inside of an airplane wing, or in surgical tasks like accessing a location inside the human body without damaging delicate surrounding tissue. In theory, controlling each joint with its own motor allows the most complete control over such a robot but, as the number of joints grows, the weight, space, and power demand of so many motors quickly becomes impractical. This project explores how the robot can operate with only two motors mounted at the base of the robot, using a gear train that transmits power through every joint, and a set of small controllable pins that can lock the segments to the gear train in various configurations. The project seeks to discover control sequences that allow the robot to achieve full functionality despite this reduced control authority. The project includes a study of how key measures of robot performance change as the number of joints and segments increases. This study will guide serial chain robot design for applications including manufacturing, medicine, and search and rescue, thus benefiting the US economy and society. <br/><br/>This project will look to create a new underactuated manipulator design using a novel multiplexing mechanism to enable a modularity that reduces mechanical complexity and eases the limitations of actuator strength. This multiplexing also enables kinematic tuning that can be used for complex environment inspection. Products will include a theoretical framework incorporating an array of possible limitations, to understand the upper limit on the number of articulations. The ultimate goal is systems with hundreds or even thousands of articulations, with conforming abilities for whole-body manipulation and grasping.

As part of this evolution, large language models have proven to be powerful assets, enabling the automation of various software engineering tasks. Collectively known as Large Language Models for Code (LLMc), these models have been effectively utilized to assist developers in fixing bugs, code generation, software documentation, software testing, and code review, among other practices. The success of LLMc is largely attributed to advancements in computational hardware and the growing availability of large-scale training datasets. However, the increasing reliance on LLMc has also brought to light significant concerns regarding sustainability and environmental impact. Training and deploying LLMc demands extensive computational resources, resulting in significant energy consumption, high costs, and substantial carbon emissions, posing challenges to their long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, this project aims to lay the groundwork for developing sustainable and cost-effective artificial intelligence methods in software engineering automation by enhancing the efficiency of LLMc. The project will integrate its research findings into computer science academic courses, which will help equip future software engineers with the knowledge and tools necessary for sustainable adoption of LLMc in software engineering practices.<br/><br/>The proposal focuses on two key strategies: (i) optimizing training data by filtering out low-quality instances using software engineering task-specific metrics, thus reducing computational costs while preserving learning capabilities, and (ii) applying model compression techniques, particularly quantization, to significantly decrease model size and resource consumption without compromising performance. Preliminary research has shown the effectiveness of these methods in improving efficiency for code-related tasks such as code generation and summarization. Building on these insights, this project will expand such optimizations to a wider range of software engineering automation tasks, ensuring their applicability across various scenarios.

E-braille tools like dynamic tactile displays hold immense potential for enhancing the learning experience for blind and visually impaired children. These devices provide dynamic access to digital information in Braille format, making learning and engagement interactive and efficient for blind and visually impaired children. There is a substantial need for cutting-edge haptic assistive technologies that support Braille learning for people with blindness and visual impairments. This project seeks to transform the educational landscape for blind and visually impaired children by leveraging refreshable braille displays for engaging and accessible STEM games specifically designed for elementary school children with blindness and visual impairments. These games serve a dual purpose: enhancing essential STEM skills and ultimately advancing Braille literacy. To provide research guidance towards designing and implementing educational STEM games accompanied with an affordable refreshable Braille display (RBD) specifically for elementary school children with blindness and visual impairment, the project utilizes the initially developed prototypes featuring tactile buttons and audio feedback to interface with computers, tablets, or smartphones.  The objective is to equip children with blindness and visual impairment with educational technology experiences that are on par with those accessible to their sighted peers of the same age group. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) Design and develop inclusive, interactive educational games for STEM education that utilize a cost-effective RBD, specifically aimed at improving Braille literacy for children with blindness and visual impairments. 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of these Braille-based educational games in enhancing essential skills in STEM education for blind and visually impaired children. 3) Investigate user experience and accessibility to refine and optimize the educational games for maximum engagement and learning outcomes among blind and visually impaired children. The project goals are directed by these research questions: 1) How does varying the spacing between Braille characters and lines in 3D-printed sets impact individuals with blindness and visual impairment?s ability to accurately and comfortably discern individual characters and shapes? 2) When presented with fundamental shapes (e.g., square, triangle, circle) using the same spacing as Braille configurations, how effectively can individuals with blindness and visual impairment detect and identify these shapes? 3) Which specific configuration of spacing between characters, between lines, or both provides the optimal balance for users in terms of ease of reading Braille characters and shape recognition on a Braille display? This research is organized into three comprehensive phases: the design and development of inclusive, interactive STEM educational games, the evaluation of their effectiveness in real scenarios, and the investigation of user experience and accessibility to optimize engagement and learning outcomes. Data collection and analysis will encompass both quantitative and qualitative elements. Quantitative data will be derived from pre-test and post-test scores, which will be analyzed using statistical methods such as paired t-tests, independent t-tests, and ANOVA. Qualitative data will be collected through structured questionnaires and interviews, providing deeper insights into the usability, accessibility, and overall user experience of the STEM games.

To enable the creation of an ELM industry responsive to the Dear Colleague Letter ?Funding Opportunities for Engineering Research in Biotechnology? (NSF 24-040), the developmental bottlenecks must be addressed. This will require inputs from experts in synthetic biology, microbiology, materials science, multiple engineering disciplines, as well as the social sciences, architecture, and law. This award will support an ELM Workshop, a unique US-based opportunity for all stakeholder groups to engage in discussion of research needs and translational opportunities. This workshop will solidify the USA?s leading role in the nascent ELM industry, foster ideation around the creation of ELM research institutes, and support development of multidisciplinary curricula to educate a workforce in this field.<br/><br/>The ELM Workshop will advance knowledge through sharing of current research, identifying the principal challenges to manufacturing and deployment of ELMs, and building a community that includes both researchers and industry affiliates, as well as government representatives. The workshop is scheduled to take place on October 22-24, 2025 in Houston, Texas at the Bioscience Research Collaborative, a space dedicated to collaborative life science research between Rice University and the Texas Medical Center. = The program will include keynote addresses and other research presentations, discussion panels, breakout discussions, networking opportunities, and a poster session featuring early career researchers. Keynote presentations will cover a range of topics including artificial intelligence and computation, off-earth applications, molecular assembly, and use of consortia. An immediate outcome of the 2025 ELM Workshop will be increasing the focus on ELM research and development. Additionally, a recurring ELM Workshop series will be established for sustained progress and online activities expanded for consistent communication in the field. Results of the event in the form of recordings of the event will be shared (with presenter approval) via a YouTube channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence service systems should be designed and controlled with these dependencies in mind, with transparent policies that can be easily understood by the layperson, and are simple to implement in practice.<br/><br/>Service systems with the aforementioned dependencies cannot be approached with ?standard? queueing techniques assuming independence because their queueing processes do not admit a finite-dimensional Markov representation, regardless of distributional assumptions.

Finally, the issues that a controller must address, such as multi-stability, congestion collapse and extreme (?fluid-scaled?) stochastic fluctuations, are entirely different than those arising in the ?standard? models which assume independence. These issues require sophisticated control mechanisms exploiting the special features of the queueing processes, such as rejecting equilibria points for the fluid models. Finally, optimal-design problems are non-standard, because the subdivision of customers into classes, and of the server pool into separate pools dedicated to specific customer classes contradict well-established results for the independent models, such as the benefits of server pooling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, scientists have not had the right tools to closely examine these tiny layered devices. The research team plans to solve this problem by developing a new kind of light-based tool using terahertz radiation ?in between microwave and infrared light. This method, based on a recent breakthrough by the team in generating terahertz radiation, can be used right on the chip and can detect both the energy and structure of these quantum phases.

The proposed research aims to fill the critical gap in current research. The research team will develop in-situ terahertz spectroscopy to directly access low energy excitations in moiré quantum matter. This approach is based on the discovery by the team of intense and broadband terahertz generation from the van der Waals ferroelectric semiconductor niobium oxydiiodide with record-setting efficiency. This terahertz emitter can be integrated into van der Waals heterostructures for on-chip near-field terahertz spectroscopy of a target moiré material/device. In addition to the low energy scales characterized by the correlation gaps, this experiment will also quantify the degree of correlation and topologies.

The research team will i) probe the correlation gaps; ii) measure terahertz photo-conductivity of correlated charge carriers; iii) determine topologies from selection rules of resonant excitation with circularly polarized terahertz field, and iv) determine the dynamics of electronic excitations with optical pump and terahertz probe.

This research project will strive to solve these challenges by providing a novel methodology that integrates control systems and reinforcement learning to maintain stability, enabling fast learning, and ensuring time-critical recovery. The outcomes of this work intend to unlock transformative applications in construction, disaster response, and industrial automation. For instance, aerial robots could autonomously deliver and position cables and rods in construction projects, manipulate fire hoses in emergency scenarios, or deploy temporary plastic covers for roof protection during natural disasters. This project can promote scientific progress in robotics and benefits society through safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. It has the potential to reduce human risks in hazardous environments and provide automated solutions to labor-intensive tasks. The educational and outreach components include the development of an open-source platform for aerial transportation ? a collective effort with students from all levels ? and collaborations with K-12 schools, supporting the next generation of scientists by encouraging early interest in programming and engineering.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the field of aerial manipulation of flexible objects by developing a modular control architecture that progresses from stable behaviors to optimal performance.

This controller establishes a robust baseline for reinforcement learning, which enables aerial robots to explore and optimize control strategies through interaction. By integrating adaptive control with reinforcement learning, the framework combines the reliability of baseline stability with the agility and efficiency of learned strategies. To address challenges associated with high-speed maneuvers and the inherent risks of real-world operation, the framework incorporates contingency strategies that allow the system to detect and recover rapidly from unstable states.

Current methods for hydrocarbon functionalization typically involve multi-step and energy-intensive processes. New catalysts that provide more direct and efficient routes for hydrocarbon functionalization can advance the chemical and energy sectors. While there are opportunities to increase energy efficiency of large-scale chemical processes, there are also substantial scientific challenges. In this project, Professor Gunnoe's group will develop new understanding of how to perform selective and energy-efficient catalytic chemical transformations that are essential to the goal of using natural gas and other fossil resources in a more energy-efficient manner. <br/><br/>Catalytic small molecule functionalization using molecular transition metal complexes often involves catalytic cycles that feature changes in the formal oxidation state of the metal. It is common that proposed catalytic cycles involve a transition metal catalyst that mediates a series of bond-breaking and bond-forming steps while cycling through at least two different redox states. Hence, kinetic access to multiple oxidation states is critical to rapid catalysis. However, accessing multiple formal oxidation states can be particularly problematic for catalytic hydrocarbon functionalization reactions using low valent metals for C?H bond-breaking under conditions that include an oxidant, because the presence of an oxidant can lead to formation of more stable, higher valent redox state(s). The research effort will focus on three objectives. Objective 1. Understand the impact of capping arene ligands on hydrocarbon activation and functionalization reactions that involve redox changes at the transition metal. Objective 2.

The system addresses the challenge of guiding vehicles safely in regions where conventional positioning signals are weak, unavailable, or vulnerable to cyber-attacks. All current methods of vehicle localization depend on satellite signals prone to signal disruption and 3D mapping that is costly to produce and maintain, limiting their coverage to select areas. This new method ensures positioning using vehicle's on-board sensors and two-dimensional, widely available maps while a global positioning system (GPS) signal is not available or intentionally blocked by a cyberattack. This resilient approach enhances public safety, supports mobility across urban and rural areas, and bolsters economic productivity by enabling broader adoption of advanced transportation technologies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of a sensor-driven localization framework that integrates vehicle kinematic dead reckoning with widely accessible, two-dimensional map information. The framework employs a kinematic dead reckoning methodology to estimate vehicle position from on-board vehicle sensors such as velocity, steering rate, steering angle, and yaw rate. To address the inherent drift associated with dead reckoning, an arc-length-based map-matching algorithm synchronizes the predicted trajectory with spatial features derived from map data. By merging temporal kinematic predictions with spatial map details, the system maintains high accuracy in environments where satellite-based positioning is unreliable or compromised.

This project addresses a challenge of modern agriculture related to the sustainable management of animal manure, which, if not properly managed, can significantly impact the environment, public health, and the economy. The team seeks to implement a novel process to optimize nutrient recovery and produce engineered carbon materials from animal manure which not only repurposes animal manure but also enhances its value as an efficient fertilizer. The project aims to improve the efficiency of resource utilization and impact in the agricultural sector. If successful, this technology will substantially alleviate the environmental, health, and economic burden associated with nutrient release into water bodies. It may also enable local farmers and others to develop new products, thereby increasing revenues and reducing environmental pollution and waste disposal costs. The project will also provide unique training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a novel hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technology that efficiently recovers nutrients from animal manures while also producing value-added engineered carbons.  In this pH-swing HTC process, nitrogen and phosphorus will be recovered from solid animal manure to form liquid fertilizer by controlling the feedwater pH. This will also produce carbon-rich and low-impurity hydrochar, which will be further converted into engineered carbon for environmental applications. To achieve the goals of this project, the following three objectives will be pursued: 1) develop a novel pH-swing HTC technology to recover nutrients into a liquid phase from wet animal manures; 2) analyze the effects of different modification methods on the physicochemical properties as well as potential applications of the hydrochar; and 3) evaluate economic viability and environmental sustainability of nutrient recovery and engineered carbon synthesis. A range of laboratory experiments and model simulations will be conducted to understand the effects of pH-swing HTC processes and carbon-modification methods on the quality of liquid fertilizer and engineered carbon derived from animal manure. Technoeconomic analysis and life cycle assessment will be conducted to assess the environmental and economic benefits of nutrient recovery and engineered carbon synthesis.  The success of the project will offer new insight into the chemical reactions and physical transformations occurring during the HTC of animal wastes. It will also be a significant step towards scaling-up and commercialization of the pH-swing HTC technology for a sustainable circular bioeconomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A non-invasive wearable core body thermometer does not exist on the market and the development of such technology is a challenging research topic. This project extends beyond the current state of the art to enable better estimation of internal temperature, with a focus on monitoring brain temperature during cardiac surgeries. Upper aortic dissection surgery requires deep brain cooling to below 20°C and is one of the three most dangerous surgeries with a 17% mortality rate, 66% risk of cognitive loss, and risk of bleeding and stroke. Today there is no way to directly measure brain temperature, and invasive catheters are used to measure bladder or nasal temperatures which lag the actual brain temperature by up to 8°C during cooling. This project is developing a sensor that can reduce the mortality rate of aortic repair by 20% and reduce the risk of permanent cognitive loss. There are 29,000 such procedures in the US annually. Additional needs for monitoring brain temperature, with 1.3 million persons annually, include ICU patients hospitalized from cardiac arrest, stroke, or brain trauma (TBI). Accurate and non-invasive measurements of internal body temperature also enable real-time monitoring of a patient who may be septic or is experiencing a heat stroke. This project contributes significantly to the field of microwave thermometry by introducing innovative solutions to the long-standing challenge of being able to pin-point the location where internal heating is occurring. In addition to its impacts in medical applications, the research outcome will also benefit industrial applications, such as high-power microwave processing for ceramic fabrication, waste pyrolysis, and fuel-cell material sintering, by monitoring the internal temperature deep inside hot materials. <br/><br/>This project addresses improving spatial resolution in thermometry using near-field microwave passive sensing with receiver arrays. Subsurface tissue temperature can be non-invasively estimated from a single passive radiometric sensor mounted on the skin. The peak of the black-body curve for human temperature is in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum. Limited to classical electromagnetic skin depth, the sensing depth at IR is only a few millimeters, implying the need of using lower microwave frequencies for deep tissue sensing (>3 cm) where the received thermal noise power is in the -100 dBm range and requires very sensitive receivers. Currently, the quiet radio-astronomy band at 1.4 GHz gives a good trade-off between sensing depth and near-field antenna size. The project explores the following three research tasks: 1) Theory and simulations of three fundamentally different approaches for improving spatial resolution of near-field microwave radiometry while maintaining temperature sensitivity; 2) Designs of receiver, near-field antenna and signal processing as experimental validation of the most promising approaches; 3) Investigation of a new alternative and complementary active low-power approach based on resonant loading and temperature dependence of the complex tissue permittivity. The research addresses the unsolved problem of measuring internal body temperature noninvasively with high spatial resolution. While a phased array is typically used for improving spatial resolution in the far field for coherent signals, the innovation here takes advantage of the statistical nature of thermal noise power combined with electromagnetic reciprocity. Theory shows that a scalar measurement is related to a spatial interference pattern, which helps differentiate temperature at different locations deep in tissues. The project aims to demonstrate, for the first time, how an array of near-field antennas and receivers can provide spatial information of temperature sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is the first to systematically identify U.S. public perceptions of human extinction itself and of GCRs that could cause extinction?including risk perceptions, judgments of the need for action, protective decision preferences, and non-protective and information search intentions. The study documents how these views relate to each other, as well as to potential cognitive, affective, social, cultural, and demographic predictors. <br/><br/>Risk communication experiments determine how responses vary due to cognitive (professional and public risk estimates; time perspective) and cultural (culturally biased decision options) manipulations.

Beyond advancing long-read sequencing, the platform will also support DNA preparation for other sequencing (next-generation sequencing) and analytical methods, broadening its impact. The sequencing sample preparation market is a large and rapidly growing market (annual growth rate of 13.4%), with long-read sequencing currently comprising ~10% of the total market. By overcoming critical barriers, this innovation will accelerate the adoption of long-read sequencing, drive market growth, and contribute to improved health outcomes through enhanced diagnostics and research capabilities.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to resolve a major challenge in genomic sequencing by advancing a novel technology for high-quality DNA sample preparation. Building on successful Phase I outcomes, the project focuses on developing commercial-grade prototypes and refining an automated platform for preparing long DNA strands. Key research objectives include fabricating user-friendly cartridges and instruments, improving platform performance, and validating the technology with input from leading research institutions. The approach utilizes a process that selectively traps genomic material in a microscale flow cell, where an electric field and pressure-driven flow work in tandem to enable purification and preparation within a single device. By the conclusion of Phase II, the project aims to deliver fully operational prototypes optimized for commercialization. These innovations are expected to streamline sample preparation, significantly reducing time, cost, and complexity while enhancing outcomes. The resulting technology will support broader adoption of long-read sequencing and other genomic applications, unlocking new possibilities in research, healthcare, and diagnostics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses a challenge of modern agriculture related to the sustainable management of animal manure, which, if not properly managed, can significantly impact the environment, public health, and the economy. The team seeks to implement a novel process to optimize nutrient recovery and produce engineered carbon materials from animal manure which not only repurposes animal manure but also enhances its value as an efficient fertilizer. The project aims to improve the efficiency of resource utilization and impact in the agricultural sector. If successful, this technology will substantially alleviate the environmental, health, and economic burden associated with nutrient release into water bodies. It may also enable local farmers and others to develop new products, thereby increasing revenues and reducing environmental pollution and waste disposal costs. The project will also provide unique training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a novel hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technology that efficiently recovers nutrients from animal manures while also producing value-added engineered carbons.  In this pH-swing HTC process, nitrogen and phosphorus will be depleted from solid animal manure to liquid fertilizer by controlling the feedwater pH. This will also produce carbon-rich and low-impurity hydrochar, which will be further converted into engineered carbon for environmental applications. To achieve the goals of this project, the following three objectives will be pursued: 1) develop a novel pH-swing HTC technology to recover nutrients into liquid phase from wet animal manures; 2) analyze the effects of different modification methods on the physicochemical properties as well as potential applications of the hydrochar; and 3) evaluate economic viability and environmental sustainability of nutrient recovery and engineered carbon synthesis. A range of laboratory experiments and model simulations will be conducted to explore and understand the effects of pH-swing HTC processes and carbon-modification methods on the quality of liquid fertilizer and engineered carbon derived from animal manure. Technoeconomic analysis and life cycle assessment will be conducted to assess the environmental and economic benefits of nutrient recovery and engineered carbon synthesis.  The success of the project will offer new insight into the chemical reactions and physical transformations occurring during the HTC of animal wastes. It will also be a significant step towards scaling-up and commercialization of the pH-swing HTC technology for sustainable circular bioeconomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, rising ocean temperatures are shifting prey abundance and distributions, often reducing the availability of energy rich prey. This can reduce the amount of energy available for predators to find prey and reduce their reproductive output. This project will investigate the relationship between prey quality and population-level productivity using common terns in the Gulf of Maine. The project will assess the importance of reduced prey quality to tern energetic budgets and predict the consequences of climate-mediated shifts in prey fields on predator population persistence. This project will also provide research opportunities for undergraduates, mentoring opportunities for the fellow, and include free community lectures on topics related to this project.<br/><br/>Leveraging reproductive output data, fecal DNA metabarcoding, bomb calorimetry, and GPS tracking, this project will assess the relationship between prey quality, bioenergetics, and population level productivity using common terns (Sterna hirundo) in the Gulf of Maine as the study system. Over the last decade, the Gulf of Maine has exhibited rapid warming leading to declines in lipid-rich forage fish populations coinciding with shifts in common tern diet and population fluctuations. The specific objectives of this study are to 1) assess the correlative relationship between annual prey quality and population level productivity, and 2) use identified relationships to predict potential consequences of future change in prey quality to predator population persistence. As climate change drives ocean warming, continuous shifts in prey composition and abundances will have harmful effects on predators that cannot alter their movements on similar timescales as their prey. Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which shifts in prey fields impact marine predators is critical for anticipating future changes to ecosystem structures under climate change scenarios.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DECLs are synthesized by tagging chemical precursors with small, unique fragments of DNA to ?bar-coded? the precursors. These are then reacted in a combinatorial fashion to generate millions-to-billions of novel chemical entities for testing against previously ?undruggable? proteins. While this strategy is low-cost and efficient, a major drawback is the inability of fragile DNA tags to tolerate oxidation conditions, which restricts the diversity of the resulting compound libraries. To address this challenge, the Schomaker and Martell teams are developing mild oxidative reactions that preserve the integrity of the DNA, significantly broadening the scope of drug candidates that are made with DECL technology. They are also investigating how altering the positioning of DNA barcodes influences library preparation and their resulting bioactivity. Drawing on their combined expertise, the team is designing innovative on-DNA oxidations catalyzed by Earth-abundant metals, such as copper. From a training perspective for young scientists, UW and GSK are creating a two-week summer course on the syntheses, analyses and applications of DECLs to encourage academic researchers to adapt their new synthetic methods to the preparation of novel drug libraries. The theory portion of the course surveys the benefits of DELC for drug discovery and highlights the challenges of conducting chemistry on DNA, while the hands-on portion focuses on the manipulation, synthesis and analyses of DNA-linked organic compounds.<br/><br/>This proposal brings together expertise in reaction methodology (Schomaker), use of non-genomic DNA to construct hybrid catalysts to accelerate reactions (Martell), and capabilities in analytical chemistry, molecular biology and informatics (Chai, GSK) to advance the power of DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DECLs).  Typical approaches to prepare large (> 1,000,000), unique compound libraries cost millions-to-billions of dollars ; however, DECL technology, which combines DNA barcoding with high-throughput chemistry, enables the creation and screening of billions of compounds at a fraction of the usual cost. A big challenge in expanding the scope of DECLs has been the lack of viable oxidative transformations that can be conducted on DNA, as DNA barcodes often degrade under oxidative conditions. This GOALI collaboration between GSK and UW-Madison is developing powerful oxidative methods for on-DNA library synthesis to expand the structural diversity and Fsp3 of current drug screening libraries. The goals of this collaboration are: 1) developing three-component oxidative cyclization reactions on DNA, 2) merging on-DNA Cu-mediated oxidation with three-component click reactions to expand DEL diversity, and 3) creating DNA-scaffolded catalysis for efficient oxidation reactions with minimal damage to DNA. Significance and broader impacts of this work stems from: 1) developing complexity-generating oxidative methods that are successfully conducted on DNA, 2) applying new methods to generate novel DELs that expand GSK?s bioactive/therapeutic chemical space, 3) providing new drug candidate leads with improved bioactivity, efficacy and ADMET properties to the broader community, and 4) validating methods for the analyses of DECL able to utilize shared instrumentation in academic settings. GSK and UW are establishing freely accessible protocols for the community by creating a two-week workshop on the theory and practical aspects of DNA-encoded library construction, analysis and screening to encourage other academic labs to adopt this technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Non-Technical Summary <br/>A bottlebrush polymer consists of a long linear backbone densely grafted with many relatively short linear side chains. Recent advances have shown that mechanical, physical, and biochemical features can be independently encoded into the molecular architecture of bottlebrush polymers. Nevertheless, as for any polymers, it is of foundational importance to understand the molecular structure of bottlebrush polymers. A widely accepted view is that strong steric repulsion among highly overlapped side chains pre-strains the bottlebrush backbone. However, recent breakthroughs suggest that for a bottlebrush polymer with highly incompatible backbone and side chains, the backbone does not have to be pre-strained; instead, it can fold into a cylindrical core with all grafting sites on its surface, thereby reducing interfacial free energy. This so-called foldable bottlebrush polymer provides a new building block for the development of polymer-based soft (bio)materials. This project seeks to establish the deterministic relationships between molecular architecture, mesoscopic conformation, and macroscopic properties of foldable bottlebrush polymers and networks, as well as to demonstrate the application of foldable bottlebrush polymers as a new class of resins for multi-material additive manufacturing. The resulting knowledge, materials, methods, and tools will positively impact polymer science and engineering, drug delivery, tissue engineering, soft robotics, and advanced manufacturing. By providing opportunities for interdisciplinary research and organizing local scientific activities, this program will train students from diverse backgrounds to be next-generation scientific leaders in polymers and soft materials. Through outreach interactions with local high schools, the PI will leverage additive manufacturing demonstrations to attract students to STEM fields.<br/><br/>2. Technical Summary <br/>The research goal of this project is to establish the foundational science of foldable bottlebrush polymers and networks. Guided by a new molecular theory, foldable bottlebrush polymers with prescribed molecular architecture parameters will be designed, synthesized, and characterized to elucidate their deterministic molecular architecture-mesoscopic structure-nonlinear mechanical property relationships. Based on the understanding of individual foldable bottlebrush polymers, a constitutive law will be developed to describe the remarkable nonlinear stress-strain behavior of foldable bottlebrush polymer networks. Finally, the foldable bottlebrush concept will be exploited to develop photocurable resins of dramatically different mechanical properties but crosslinked by the same chemistry. Using a customized additive manufacturing platform, these resins will be transformed into functional multi-material three-dimensional structures. These research activities will develop new knowledge for designing, methods for creating, and technologies for processing foldable bottlebrush polymers and networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, enzymes require many types of chemical energy, which can be hard to supply outside of living cells. This project introduces a groundbreaking solution: using AI to design new enzymes that can be powered directly by electricity instead. As a proof-of-concept, the researchers will design enzymes to convert CO??a gas that exists all around us?into methanol, a valuable fuel and industrial chemical. This research has the potential to establish electricity-driven biology as a powerful sustainable biomanufacturing tool. Ultimately, this work could position the U.S. as a global leader in innovation within the emerging bioeconomy?where electricity-powered chemical production expands what is commercially possible.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to transform the electrochemical conversion of CO? to methanol by developing a highly efficient, cell-free enzymatic cascade system, positioning bioelectrochemistry as a commercially viable technology. Current methods lose over 50% of input energy, making commercial deployment economically challenging. Through a cross-sector collaboration between academia and industry, the project seeks to achieve energy efficiencies exceeding 70% by integrating AI-driven enzyme design, synthetic chemistry, and advanced electrochemical methods. The project will scale up enzyme production, optimize synthetic mediators, improve system stability through electrochemical cofactor regeneration, and integrate these components into high-performance bioelectrodes compatible with existing benchtop electrolyzers. This approach offers a thermodynamically favorable and sustainable pathway for CO? valorization, converting a stable waste gas into methanol?a critical fuel and chemical feedstock.

This project will focus on development of distributed solutions to the optimal topology selection problem among robots with asymmetric interactions where robots have different sensor modalities. Conventionally, centralized computation and perfect localization is assumed for multi-robot systems. However, when a system is deprived of such a setting, robots in a team must rely on robust one-to-one interaction using on-board sensors. This project looks to select an optimal set of robot-robot interactions to conduct stable multi-robot coordination using distributed algorithms. This research seeks to enable more robust coordination of multi-robot systems to environmental conditions such that these teams of robots can be used in out of lab settings without depending on any centralized base station. Multi-robot coordination has viable applications from enhancing agricultural yield by monitoring crops, to automating safety of critical infrastructure like power stations, and acting against adversaries. Furthermore, both undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary working groups for early career professionals focused on translational research and pedagogy.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to multi-robot systems which are stable and robust in coordination to carry out tasks. It looks to achieve this goal by formulating an optimal topology selection problem and developing scalable control-theoretic methods for topology control that guarantee stability and robustness to disturbance in the presence of asymmetric robot interactions. The project takes a multi-tiered approach to: i) solve a distributed optimal topology selection problem; ii) validate the algorithms in high-fidelity physics based simulations, and iii) test the algorithms on a team of unmanned aerial vehicles, in real-world conditions using the off-the-shelf robotic and sensor platforms.

The goal is to provide regulators with tools to promote beneficial portfolios of battery storage and electricity production technologies, while also accounting for risks, transmission limitations and unpredictable events. Other outcomes of this project are expected to include development of new classes on Electricity Markets, support of new graduate students working in this area, and industrial collaborations.<br/><br/><br/>A recurring question in electric power markets has been: are spot prices sufficient to incentivize enough investment in generation capacity, storage, and demand-side management in order to ensure reliable and sustainable operating conditions? In other words, are spot prices enough by themselves to stimulate efficient mixes of electricity supply and storage that ensure that the resulting grid is resilient, reliable and sustainable? This question will be addressed by a new framework that will incorporate realistic market features and explore their implications for short- and long-run equilibria, optimal capacity prices, and net benefits of market designs. These features include battery storage and variable wind and solar resources, as well as risk-aversion, incomplete markets, transmission congestion, optimal demand management, and other features. The new framework will use a unique set of analytical and computational methods to solve for Nash equilibria in market models that are unique in their combining representations of stochastic demand processes, market participant risk attitudes, and simultaneous consideration of the role of regulators, market operators, suppliers, and consumers. The proposed framework can be simplified to have tractable dynamics, and also is general enough to incorporate all the desired features of real markets, including battery storage, variable renewables, transmission limits, evolution of capacities, and optimal demand management. The goal will then be to find Nash equilibria among the supply capacities of producers, together with the regulator's optimal capacity payments that maximize net market benefits. The aim is to compare energy-only and capacity markets, find the combination of capacity payments and price caps that maximize the reliability and net benefits of the market. In the near future, the demands upon the grid are expected to dramatically increase, as more applications switch from fossil-fuels to electricity (e.g., electric vehicles), and new uses appear (e.g., AI, bitcoin mining). Therefore, it is vital to study how to keep supply reliable and affordable, and desired generation facilities financially sustainable (in a Nash equilibrium sense), while achieving social goals of renewable power by providing incentives to the producers to ""do the right thing.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is structured around two primary objectives: (1) designing and characterizing multiexciton dynamics in radical-containing polymers, and (2) determining the spin and population dynamics to demonstrate the efficacy of spin polarization transfer in these systems. These activities will address significant hurdles hindering substantial progress in applications of SF that span from the lack of fundamental guidelines of multichromophore design in macromolecules to the orchestration of spin polarization transfer pathways to stable radicals. Traditional studies have focused on generating multiple excitons from a single photon, but this project differentiates itself by emphasizing the control and utilization of spin dynamics for energy conversion and quantum information processes. The project?s success will lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions between triplet pairs and radical spin centers, establishing new paradigms in multiexciton chemistry and molecular spintronics. This will significantly impact emerging technologies such as spintronics, magnetic imaging, and quantum information science by providing foundational knowledge for designing systems with enhanced spin polarization and stability at non-cryogenic temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stochastic thermodynamics is an emerging theoretical framework in nonequilibrium statistical physics. It has contributed to the understanding of small nonequilibrium systems through the discovery of relatively novel universal relations such as the fluctuation theorem and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Examples of such systems include colloids, quantum dots and molecular biochemical systems. The research group will investigate four relevant topics in stochastic thermodynamics: 1.) A Chimera state is a phase of interacting oscillators for which part of the oscillators synchronize and the other part does not. Considerable work has been done on Chimera states; however, the connection between Chimera states and stochastic thermodynamics remains unexplored. The research group will connect Chimera states with stochastic thermodynamics using a model the PI introduced. 2.) The thermodynamic uncertainty relation has been found to be violated for underdamped Langevin dynamics. The team aims to find bounds on current fluctuations for underdamped dynamics based on a discretization of underdamped dynamics. The last topic is an important continuation of the recent work of the research team on active heat engines. The research team will develop a linear response theory for active heat engines. 3.) Stochastic pumps are systems that generate unidirectional motion in the form of a net current with a time-periodic protocol. Their theoretical research is inspired by experiments with artificial molecular machines, which are often operated with a time-periodic protocol. A goal in this area of research is to build artificial molecules capable of performing a function inside a living organism, that is, in an active medium. The PI will investigate active stochastic pumps, an area that has been largely unexplored. In particular, the team will determine the necessary conditions for the emergence of a flux in active stochastic pumps. 4.) The PI will continue working on active heat engines.

Telescope observations of different coronal emission lines, the background continuum, and broadband white light will allow us to infer physical properties of the corona such as temperature, density, and magnetic field structure. Using data from five eclipses, spanning nearly a full solar cycle (2015?2024), this research will track changes in the corona over time and across different structures. The project will also compare these TSE observations to advanced computer simulations to refine models of the Sun?s atmosphere.

Mechanochemistry, the science of using milling, shearing, and compressing to drive chemical reactions, has been recognized internationally as an important synthesis technique. Through this Excellence in Research (EiR) project researchers at Clark Atlanta University leverage mechanochemistry for the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). COFs are 2D or 3D crystalline porous polymers with precise integration of monomer units into extended periodic networks, representing one of the most emerging porous solids owing to their eminent structural features and widespread applications, for example in gas storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, cancer therapy, and battery technology. However, traditional synthesis methods of COFs require long reaction times (3-9 days), harsh conditions (high temperatures and vacuum), and the use of toxic solvents, limiting their widespread application. The project advances insights into mechanochemical COF synthesis and enables the capability in the United States. The research plan includes the mechanosynthesis of COFs through multicomponent reactions, the development of COF-based composites, the application of COFs for radionuclide sequestration, and the elucidation of mechanochemical COF formation mechanisms. Additionally, the educational plan integrates the research into a new graduate course, undergraduate research initiatives, and an outreach program related to mechanochemistry. By engaging postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and K-12 students, this project provides exposure to frontier research which considerably expands the research capability at Clark Atlanta University.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>With this Excellence in Research (EiR) project researchers at Clark Atlanta University establish a solid-state mechanochemical synthesis methodology for the preparation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through mechanistic investigations and carry out proof-of-principle experiments aimed at radionuclide sequestration. Currently, full exploitation of the potential uses for COFs is hampered by synthetic hurdles associated with prevalent solvothermal synthesis, including long reaction times (3-9 days), high temperatures, hazardous organic solvents, anaerobic conditions, and limited scalability. Therefore, the principal investigator and his team focus on mechanochemical approaches to synthesize, modify, and utilize COFs, an approach that is not widely used in the United States. Specifically, the researchers mechanochemically hybridize COFs with various functional materials to create unique heterostructures and hierarchical COFs to create desired hierarchical porosity. They investigate the resultant COFs for radionuclide sequestration, with clear structure-function correlations and in-depth elucidation of the underlying mechanism. To enable the precision mechanosynthesis of COFs, the researchers unravel the mechanism of mechanochemical COF formation via combined experimental and computational tools, including ex-situ kinetic studies, in-situ probes, and computational simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These challenges arise from the complexity of navigating shared spaces, where multiple agents must work simultaneously while completing their tasks quickly and safely, all while avoiding collisions and reducing congestion. While considerable efforts have focused on developing advanced planning algorithms to generate high-quality, collision-free paths for these mobile agents, there has been limited focus on improving their performance through environment optimization. In this context, ""environment"" refers to the various factors that influence how autonomous agents operate. This includes the physical layouts, such as the arrangement of shelves in a warehouse or the design of roadways, which dictate how agents navigate through space. Additionally, it encompasses virtual elements, such as traffic rules and operational protocols, that guide the behavior of these agents. Furthermore, current conventions for designing layouts and traffic rules in environments such as warehouses and road networks are primarily geared toward human operators and human-driven vehicles. This focus can lead to suboptimal conditions for autonomous agents, which exhibit different behavior patterns and operational needs. Consequently, this project has two main objectives: (1) establish a foundational understanding of the importance of environment optimization for multi-agent coordination, and (2) develop innovative and potentially unconventional environment designs that are specifically tailored for large-scale multi-agent coordination across various applications.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a comprehensive, versatile framework for optimizing environments tailored to large-scale Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), centering on three foundational research areas: models, methods, and applications.

It explores different methods to optimize these environment models, which involves not only methods that directly optimize the models but also methods that optimize environment generators and updaters. Environment generators, after training, can generate environments with similar setups on potentially larger scales, and environment updaters can adapt environments in real time to accommodate dynamic changes in agents' tasks and other variables. The project focuses on three distinctive case studies, namely automated warehouses for mobile robots, unmanned traffic systems for drones, and decentralized MAPF with guarantees, to exemplify the broad applicability and efficacy of the established frameworks across various domains.

High entropy spinel oxides are a class of materials stabilized by high configurational entropy, enabling unique combinations of cation site occupancy. The research aims to test the hypothesis that compositional complexity and processing conditions can be used to finely control cation inversion, enabling tailored functional properties such as tunable magnetism and electronic behavior.<br/>The research addresses three key questions: (1) how does increasing the number of components in high entropy compositions affect cation inversion; (2) how does variation in component ratios influence inversion trends; and (3) how do synthesis and processing conditions, such as temperature and pressure, impact inversion and functional properties? The scope of the work includes synthesizing bulk, single-phase HESO compositions with varying degrees of configurational complexity through solid-state processing methods.

As power grid simulations grow in complexity and scale, there is an urgent need for more efficient computational models to meet real-time decision-making demands. Traditional simulation approaches struggle to parallelize efficiently, especially for large systems like the Eastern Interconnection with over 70,000 buses. The emergence of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) models offers promising alternatives for accelerating complex simulations. The main idea is to train neural network surrogates of numerical models, and once pre-trained, the networks can generate simulations with much faster speed and efficient scaling. This project develops a novel AI-surrogate enhanced cyberinfrastructure for accelerating power grid simulations. The resulting framework will lower barriers for power grid engineers to adopt AI surrogates, enabling interdisciplinary research and education between power systems and computer science domains.<br/><br/>The project will deliver three key innovations: (1) program-behavior analysis to identify optimal code regions for AI surrogate replacement; (2) semi-automatic AI surrogate construction that incorporates domain-specific physical knowledge; and (3) heterogeneous computing with multi-fidelity modeling that dynamically balances AI surrogates and traditional models across computing resources. The methodological approach combines static and dynamic code analysis, neural network training with physical constraints, and adaptive scheduling algorithms for CPU/GPU resources. The project aims to transform AI surrogates from auxiliary tools into essential elements for power grid planning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project  investigates the relationship between human land-use activities associated with early horticulture (i.e., farming, gardening, cultivation) and how they manifest in the archaeological record through changes in plant and microbial communities. The project advances the existing understanding of human-environment interactions in the context of increasing social complexity observed through changes in subsistence (i.e., increased reliance on food production) and settlement patterns. This study contributes to the development of two novel techniques for paleoenvironmental reconstruction from sediment that allow researchers to detect discrete but subtle levels of ecological change than current standard methods are capable of. Additionally, it produces an open-access database of high-resolution scanning electron microscope images of fossil plant structures (phytoliths), support laboratory training and professional development opportunities for undergraduate students, and provide educational material to community members.<br/><br/>The primary research question evaluated is: What is the detectable ecological response of land-use activity related to food production, specifically horticulture, at a newly occupied site? This question is addressed through 1) the analysis of phytoliths (fossil plant micro-remains) to inform on vegetation history, and 2) an assessment of microbial DNA extracted from archaeological sediment, comparing the periods before and after people are believed to have arrived at the site. The pre- and post-settlement distinction is based on associated cultural materials (e.g., pottery sherds) from previous excavation at the site and associated radiocarbon dates. The data obtained as part of this project is evaluated with previous research completed on the site and in the surrounding area, which includes a complete fire history, organic matter analysis, stable carbon isotope ratios, sediment grain size analysis, preliminary phytolith analysis, the pollen record, and two field seasons of archaeological excavation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mentored research experiences are fundamental for training future science professionals and have been linked to students' persistence in STEM.  However, access to research mentors is limiting and mechanisms for recruiting students into research favor those with exemplary academic records.  As a result, many students may not benefit from the training and skills development that comes with research experience, and students are likely to be overlooked who have enormous creative potential despite grades or standardized test scores that suggest otherwise.  Research is increasingly becoming a feature of undergraduate biology laboratory courses, but these require significant resource inputs (staffing, supplies, safety equipment) and serve far fewer students than their 'lecture-based' counterparts.  This Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project seeks to study the effectiveness of embedding research in a large-enrollment introductory biology lecture course.  Students will test hypotheses by collecting and analyzing data as part of a multi-year ecological study that documents seasonal change in local campus trees.  The timing of autumn change in plants is highly consequential for both natural and human-centered systems, including seasonally dependent economic sectors such as agriculture and tourism.  This project plans to develop technological tools and instructional materials to support both instructors and students in implementing the project in diverse contexts and proposes to develop a digital platform for integrating local campus data with a national database accessible to anyone with internet access.  Student learning outcomes will be evaluated to inform the development and revision of tools and materials, and to identify specific features and conditions of the research experience that maximize student learning and affinity for science.<br/><br/>Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have been linked to multiple positive STEM outcomes.  Mechanisms underlying CURE outcomes are not well understood but are hypothesized to be mediated through students' development of core science skills and concomitant gains in science self-efficacy and affect.  This project adapts a CURE framework to a large lecture context and evaluates student outcomes resulting from participation in a long-term study of autumn phenology in local campus trees.  Phenology (the study of recurrent natural phenomena) in plants is a high-priority research focus.  Minor shifts in the timing of plant processes (e.g., leaf color change, leaf fall) can disrupt species interactions that regulate large-scale ecosystem processes, such as biogeochemical nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.  This project seeks to develop technological infrastructure to support students in collecting high-resolution data using their mobile devices and visualizing data through an interactive app that enables comparisons among tree species, over different scales of space and time, and in relation to local weather variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature, etc.).  Students have the opportunity to develop analytical and systems thinking skills by interacting with complex real-world data and asking questions for which the answer has not been pre-determined.  Instructors receive support through the development of instructional materials and technological tools that facilitate project implementation.  A partnership with USA-National Phenology Network has the potential to establish a long-term and sustainable solution for maintaining a secure and accessible data infrastructure that expands the reach and impact of student-collected data by linking it to a repository of phenology data used by scientists, economists, and policymakers globally.  This project enhances STEM education by leveraging evidence-based and high-impact practices, providing a rich context for teaching and learning about complex systems, and engaging students in authentic inquiry that is relevant at local and global scales and in natural and managed ecosystems.  Proposed research tests hypotheses about student learning and specifically explores the role of original data collection as a contributor to CURE outcomes.  An evidence-driven design approach will inform development and revision of instructional materials and a digital infrastructure that together, will support broad dissemination in diverse educational contexts including under-resourced institutions.

The research also studies how children and adults learn visual patterns. The aim of these studies is to ask whether language learning and visual pattern learning show similar principles and timing. This information is important for the basic science of understanding learning. It is also important for supporting children and adults who show problems in learning language or other types of patterns, in school or in everyday tasks that are important for real-world success. The specific focus of this research is on a process in memory called ?consolidation.? Other investigators have shown that immediate memory for events is very sparse, but, over time, memories of specific events are integrated and enriched to form a more complete memory for significant life episodes. The studies in this project ask whether consolidation also happens for specific spoken language sequences or specific visual patterns, and whether consolidation changes specific sequence memories into learning the grammatical patterns of a language.  Additionally, this project involves STEM research training and mentoring for undergraduates and high school students.<br/><br/>To examine complex learning in a short time, researchers design miniature artificial languages and then, in a single ~20-minute exposure, present learners with auditory sequences (like ?sentences?) from the language, or sequences of visual symbols that have similar patterns. Learning is assessed by asking participants to choose sequences like those they have heard (or seen), versus sequences that have errors and are not like what they have heard or seen. Some learners are tested immediately after exposure, while other learners are tested one day or one week later, with no further exposure to the language during that time. Changes in learning after a delay, without further exposure, indicates consolidation. Across studies, this research asks about when and how consolidation occurs; what types of input undergo consolidation; and what activities can enhance or disrupt these consolidation processes. Answering these questions is important for understanding and supporting optimal learning in children and adults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Encouraged by these remarkable results, machine learning-based techniques are now being researched to design better communication systems. An important communication problem is the transmission of sources such as speech, images, and video over noisy communication networks. To efficiently accomplish this task, the source must be compressed and encoded prior to transmission. This project considers the use of machine learning models for joint compression and encoding of sources, i.e., joint source-channel coding (JSCC). One significant drawback of many existing designs of joint source-channel coding schemes based on machine learning techniques is that they use an end-to-end approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs) which hide the underlying operations, and in turn, provide little insight and are less interpretable. The objective of this research is to significantly improve the understanding of the underlying mechanism of machine learning-based solutions, such that they become computationally efficient, less storage-hungry, more adaptive, more robust, and they are easily generalized to complex communication settings. This collaborative project between Texas A&M University and Imperial College, London will offer opportunities for new curriculum development and study-abroad programs for undergraduate students.  Techniques developed in this project can inform the development of compression techniques and channel coding techniques for 6G cellular communications.<br/><br/>This project will investigate deep neural-network-based solutions to isolate their functional components, which will lead to lower-complexity, more robust, and more flexible designs for future communication networks. The proposed approach is based on comparative studies of the JSCC designs from two related but distinctive perspectives: an information-theoretic perspective and a machine-learning perspective. By studying a sequence of more and more complex vector Gaussian sources and channel scenarios, and by contrasting and comparing the schemes designed using these two different perspectives, the project aims to develop new insights and simplifications of the ML-based JSCC coding scheme designs. The research plan is organized under the following thrusts - 1) Study of signal representations and neural network interfaces in point-to-point communication settings, 2) understanding the sources of performance gains and the mechanism that results in graceful performance degradation in channels with unknown parameters; 3) Study of neural JSCC for feedback channels and multi-user communication settings; 4) Study of generative models in neural JSCC, particularly Gaussian diffusion models. Some of the JSCC schemes will be implemented on a software-radio testbed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designs in computation-constrained environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By combining microwave photonics (MWP) with polymer-based micro-ring resonator technology, the platform addresses current limitations in cancer diagnostics, such as high costs, slow processing times, and the bulky nature of existing systems. This innovation promises to make cancer screening more accessible, offering a portable and affordable solution for point-of-care testing. Beyond healthcare, the sensor's versatility enables applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and other fields, delivering significant societal and economic benefits through improved efficiency and global resilience to emerging challenges.<br/><br/>This project leverages microwave photonics (MWP) and polymer-based micro-ring resonator technology to create a precise, low-cost sensor platform for detecting ctDNA in human blood. The system is designed to address the limitations of current diagnostic tools by replacing expensive tunable lasers with a microwave frequency sweep modulated on an optical carrier. This approach dramatically reduces costs while enhancing precision and scalability. Polymer micro-ring resonators are ideal for this application due to their low manufacturing cost, compatibility with biomolecule functionalization, and ability to integrate seamlessly with microfluidics for lab-on-a-chip applications. These features make the technology suitable for multiplexed analyses of biological samples. However, achieving the high optical quality factor (Q-factor) required for high sensitivity poses significant challenges due to material imperfections, such as surface roughness and optical losses in the polymer resonators. To address these issues, advanced nano-imprint fabrication techniques are employed to minimize surface roughness, improve light confinement, and enhance light-analyte interactions. Additionally, the project employs co-design methodologies that integrate the MWP readout system with the polymer resonator design, ensuring optimal sensitivity and noise performance. Functionalized resonators with DNA-specific probes will enable selective and accurate detection of ctDNA, while integrated microfluidic channels allow for multiplexed analysis of biological samples. This design can achieve detection limits as low as tens of nanograms per milliliter, enabling reliable identification of ctDNA even in trace amounts. Validation of the platform will be conducted through rigorous testing against commercial ctDNA reference materials to ensure reliability and reproducibility. Collaboration among experts in photonics, polymer manufacturing, and oncology ensures a multidisciplinary approach to addressing both technical and clinical challenges. Beyond healthcare, the versatile platform?s modularity allows for adaptation to other fields, including environmental monitoring of pollutants and detection of pathogens in agriculture. This project advances interdisciplinary research in photonics, nanofabrication, and microfluidics while providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for global challenges.

This CAREER project focuses on enhancing the security of cyber-physical systems that are being designed using the current state of the art safe reinforcement learning methods. In general, safe learning systems focus on performance under safety constraints, however, they remain vulnerable to attacks during operation or training. Achieving safe and secure reinforcement learning protects users from systems and systems from attack. This project will develop innovations that focus on achieving these goals using precise specifications expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for studying both functional and timing vulnerabilities in these systems and eventually designing mitigation strategies. Evaluation will leverage the CARLA (CAR Learning to Act) simulator for autonomous driving research and real-world autonomous car testbeds to validate security measures, ensuring resilient CPS deployment in complex and adversarial conditions.<br/><br/>Overall, this CAREER project will lead to improvement in the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as autonomous vehicles that utilize reinforcement learning in their operation.  The project will lead to the discovery of potential security risks that target the learning process and real-time operation of the vehicle.  The project will develop real-time detection and diagnostic tools and methods that will harden the vehicle against these risks ? especially those associated with the learning and training process.  By addressing these security gaps, this research will help ensure the cyber physical systems operate reliably in real-world environments, ultimately improving safety in transportation, robotics, and other critical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression and many other vital cellular processes. Understanding how RNAs bind and fold is key to uncovering their molecular mechanisms and advancing RNA-based molecular design. Traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which do not account for electronic polarization, often fail to accurately model highly charged RNAs. In particulalr, water molecules, being highly polarizable, behave differently near these charged RNAs compared to in bulk water. In addition, explicit sovent based MD simulations are computationally expensive. To address these chanllenge, Huang and Ren will develop a new polarizable solvation model that represents water molecules around RNAs implicitly through statistical descriptions of water density and correlations. This model will adapt to changes in the local electrostatic environment, ensuring high efficiency and accuracy in modeling RNAs. Huang and Ren will apply this model to study RNA hybridization, RNA-small molecule binding, and ion-induced RNA folding. As part of the educational and component of this project, they will integrate their research findings into undergraduate and graduate courses to enhance STEM education. The developed software will be publicly available through the TINKER software package on GitHub and training workshops will be organized to educate the scientific community on the efficient use of the software.<br/><br/>Compared to the explicit solvent models, the 3-Dimensional Reference Interaction Site Model (3DRISM) simplifies the all-atom description of solvation into a density-based representation of the solvent surrounding the solute. 3DRISM eliminates the need to sample explicit solvent configurations and enables the explicit inclusion of ions (e.g., Mg²?), which are crucial for accurate RNA modeling. However, current 3DRISM solvent models rely on pair correlation functions and cannot explicitly account for the many-body response in solvent. To overcome these limitations, Huang and Ren will develop a polarizable-3DRISM (p3DRISM) implicit solvent model to accurately model polarizable solvation for polarizable AMOEBA solutes. First, Huang and Ren will derive a new form of the 3DRISM equation that incorporates solute-solvent-solvent 3-body correlations and will develop an efficient implementation of this new equation, based on linear response theory. This approach accounts for changes in solvent-solvent correlation functions induced by polarization from the local electric field. Secondly, they will incorporate polarizable solute-solvent interactions through induced dipoles in the p3DRISM scheme. Huang and Ren will apply AMOEBA-p3DRISM to calculate free energies for RNA hybridization and RNA-small molecule binding, as well as to model Mg²?-induced folding of RNA k-turns. The software and algorithms developed will benefit the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, especially in RNA-based therapy and computer-aided drug discovery. Additional broad impacts include outreach to undergraduates at University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Texas, Austin, integration of research findings into coursework, and training workshops for the scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Iowa State University Research Experience for Teachers (ISU BIORETS) program aims to help teachers and their students better understand how organisms adapt or fail to adapt to a changing environment by promoting scientific literacy and curiosity, which impacts attitudes towards public policy and its implementation. Teachers play a crucial role in fostering scientific literacy, yet studies show that many lack confidence when teaching about how organisms adapt and the research processes related to this field. The ISU BIORETS program addresses these issues by providing teachers hands-on summer training in university research laboratories. Helping the educators develop their content knowledge and curriculum development skills will build their teaching proficiencies. In turn, their students will wrangle over real scientists' questions in the classroom to convey the cumulative nature of science - that new data adds to a more complete understanding. In addition to summer training for teachers, the program will build innovative, on-going relationships among university researchers, teachers, and their students throughout the school year, offering teachers and students opportunities to make valuable scientific contributions towards solving real-world problems. <br/><br/><br/>The project addresses an important issue in biology: how do organisms respond to a changing environment? This will be addressed through research that integrates multiple levels of biological organization from genotype to phenotype, and their interactions with the environment. Teachers will collaborate with faculty to address questions about adaptability in field and lab based projects, focusing on the theme of stability and change, a cross-cutting concept in the Next Generation Science Standards. Weekly meetings will develop and reinforce conceptual integration across different biological systems. Relationships among teachers, research mentors, and program leaders will be year-long through classroom visits, opportunities for student visits to campus, and biweekly coaching for teachers to translate research experiences into authentic and relevant learning so that students inquire more deeply and work like scientists. Where possible, deliverables will include both in-person and virtual activities, providing the flexibility needed for modern classrooms. The broad goals of this continuing BIORETS program at Iowa State University include: 1) help teachers and their students understand the process of scientific research; 2) learn how organisms adapt or fail to adapt to environmental change; 3) promote scientific literacy of both teacher and student; and 4) build opportunities for promoting student scientific curiosity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, most plastic and rubber parts are made by molding: A liquid polymer resin is poured into an expensive mold, let to cure or solidify, then removed from the mold while ensuring that the final part meets the expected quality. Examples of such parts include the casings of computer keyboard, mouse, monitor, webcam, car dashboard, kitchen mixer, tennis rackets, and shoe soles. However, these molds are expensive because they are made of metals using elaborate machining processes, and they require frequent maintenance to ensure that they can be used for many parts. On the other hand, plants and trees simply grow to their geometries without needing molds. This project will study a mold-free production of parts, called growth printing, which could eliminate the cost of the mold and its maintenance. This Additive Manufacturing (AM) method is anticipated to be very fast because it uses a chemical liquid resin which can solidify instantaneously on demand using laser triggering. It is anticipated to be 100 folds faster than current 3D printers, which leads to considerable savings in cost and time to make useful strong and tough parts.<br/><br/>This research studies a mold free manufacturing process which relies on a propagating reaction front, naturally self-driven by the exothermic polymerization of the monomer dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). This polymerization front is thermally triggered from a point heat source, such as a laser.  This front propagates radially in the resin vat, curing the monomer into poly-DCPD, a high-performance cross-linked polymer. A metal initiator is connected to a motion stage such that it pulls the solidified part from the liquid with a vertical velocity profile which defines the part geometry. This research looks to use multiple point laser initiation to trigger the nucleation of an array of curing fronts, which then grow and merge. The merging fronts define the cross-section geometry of the part while the height is defined by the upward motion of the initiator tip. The tasks will study the laser initiation of frontal polymerization experimentally, analytically, and numerically; the geometry and physics of merging fronts; and the applicability to industrially relevant part designs. Education activities include a design competition for K-12 students to convey the importance of manufacturing speed and cost; develop a new lecture on constructive controversy on manufacturing and industry; and lab open house activities for visitors of all ages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research intends to support the creation of new traffic models by integrating high-fidelity trajectory data and machine learning techniques and will create novel traffic control strategies under both current and future transportation infrastructure settings. Properties of highway traffic flow, such as the relationship between flow (e.g., vehicles per hour) and density (number of vehicles per mile), depend on highly complex nonlinear interactions between individual drivers on the roadway. Traditionally, traffic control has been conducted using an aggregate approximation of the flow dynamics based on average observed driver behavior. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence allow for development of more nuanced and complex physics-informed models that can readily and quickly predict traffic behavior after observing driving behavior of individual vehicles in the flow. The development of such artificial-intelligence-guided traffic models will allow researchers and practitioners to leverage new data streams and integrate these into a framework for traffic control that is customized for specific observed traffic. Developed novel traffic control techniques intend to result in more efficient traffic control without the need for a major overhaul of our transportation infrastructure, saving investments and costs for infrastructure managers while improving traffic efficiency and reducing traffic congestion and travel time. The research, education and outreach plans are tightly integrated to further disseminate impacts through active and interactive learning opportunities that broaden participation in STEM.<br/><br/>To enable next generation traffic control that considers the dynamics of individual vehicles and their impact on the aggregate traffic flow, this research intends to (i) develop methods that rely on low-rank characterizations of time-series driving data to rapidly and reliably identify an individual vehicle driving signature, (ii) develop an artificial intelligence-guided modeling framework that relies on physics-informed learning to quickly predict the resulting aggregate traffic flow dynamics of a particular collection of vehicles with distinct driving signatures and a specified local interaction network topology, and (iii) design a suite of next-generation traffic control options including both control at fixed locations in the infrastructure, as well as control distributed throughout the flow that leverage more precise knowledge of the macroscopic dynamics to adjust control strategies based on the driving signature of individual vehicles and the anticipated resulting aggregate flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology (Internet of Things (IoT) device + artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software sold as a software-as-a-service) enables fully automated, remote, low-cost, and continuous assessment of the structural health of buildings or infrastructure assets. The technology targets many structures for which current monitoring or risk assessment techniques are not economically viable, while minimizing staff exposure to risk and human errors. Structural failures can lead to an exceedingly high risk of economic loss (for bridge faults >$100 billion/year). Large-scale federal infrastructure investment programs are expected to address these losses and close critical infrastructure gaps (U.S. bridge repair backlog >$125 billion). However, for these investments to realize their full economic potential, effective infrastructure assessment and maintenance processes are needed. This technology will allow asset operators to lower the costs of ownership, improve maintenance efficiency, and reduce risks, yielding a substantial return on investment (> $10,000/structure) within five years of operation.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is based on its unique, highly scalable, and widely applicable approach. It comprises an IoT device to record vibration data from structures and a proprietary machine-learning-based software to process the timeseries vibration data to identify anomalies indicative of structural faults or decay.

The specific technical objectives of this project include the design of an IoT device, the data acquisition from real world assets and validation of the approach through comparisons with data collected from scale models of these real-world assets. The project addresses three key technical challenges: 1) the use of inherently noisy time series data that may affect the accuracy of the approach, 2) the generalizability of the approach in allowing for applications with a wide range of infrastructure assets and building types, and 3) a potential operational unreliability of the sensors upon their deployment to remote test sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, the project will provide college students with opportunities to learn across different polar and climate science topics, leveraging the resources and expertise of the participating institutions.<br/> <br/>Preconditioning of sea ice before the summer months has long been recognized as a vital predictor of September's Arctic sea ice extent. The dynamic interactions between ice, ocean, and atmosphere are also major contributors to the changes observed in summer sea ice. The researchers will examine the impacts from external climate components and how they interact with the persistent local conditions before the summer season, which has not been fully considered in previous studies. This project will develop models of regional Arctic sea ice coverage based on a diverse array of observational data at a global scale, integrated by an advanced machine learning method. This approach aims to capture the complex, non-linear variations in both local and remote influences across timescales in a global context. The investigators will conduct a series of meticulously designed reforecast experiments to isolate and quantify the influence of various physical drivers on summertime Arctic ice within the predictive framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores a new kind of optimization, where instead of returning one best solution, the goal is to return a set of many good solutions that are as different from each other as possible. The award will investigate the most important problems in computer science from this new angle. The PI will lead a team to invent algorithms for these problems that return a maximally diverse (maximally dispersed) set of solutions within the solution space. The returned solutions will not only look different from each other, but each solution will also be good with respect to the original criteria. The ability to quickly generate diverse solutions has multiple potential benefits to society. First, presenting a user with multiple solutions not only gives more choice, but it may also help discover criteria that the user was unaware of or found hard to formalize. <br/>Second, a user gains the ability to quickly switch from one good solution to another good-but-very-different solution in case of an adversarial attack. Third, by dividing and scheduling tasks between different solutions, energy efficiency can be achieved by balancing loads in the systems deployed using these solutions. For many of the problems stated in the award, algorithms that return one solution are taught<br/>in an undergraduate algorithms course. The diverse solutions variants of these problems are also natural to motivate in the classroom, particularly for geometric problems where one can visually gauge the diversity. The investigator plans to include simple algorithms for the diverse variants, and design coding projects based on them. The investigator is committed to producing the next generation of researchers and will engage undergraduate and graduate students in this project.<br/><br/>This project is aimed towards developing an algorithmic, technique-focused study of the task of generating diverse solutions in optimization. The user specifies the optimization problem P, an approximation factor c specifying the desired quality of the solutions, and an integer s denoting the number of solutions required. The goal of the algorithm is to quickly generate s solutions to P, each of which is c-approximately optimal, and such that this collection of s solutions is as diverse as possible. Diversity will be measured as either the average distance, or the minimum distance between all pairs of the returned s solutions. The investigator plans a study of three fundamental problems in computer science, for which classical algorithms (those that return one solution) span a wide variety of techniques. The three problems are Task A) Satisfiability of k-CNF formulae (SAT), Task B) Graph Problems such as minimum spanning tree (MST) and traveling salesman problem (TSP), and Task C) Geometric Problems such as triangulations, and independent sets, vertex covers and dominating sets in planar and unit-disk graphs. The main goals of this research are to develop polynomial time bi-approximation algorithms that explore the quality-diversity tradeoff, and to develop a (partial)<br/>classification of techniques that can be used to generate diverse solutions to different problems. In terms of theoretical advancements, generating diverse solutions requires a better understanding of the geometric landscape of the space of good solutions, in particular understanding quantities like diameter, dispersed sets, expected distances, and other interesting quantities. The simple case of two most diverse solutions corresponds to the diameter of the space of solutions, that has been studied (albeit only qualitatively) for SAT solutions, triangulations, and the matching polytope. This award extends this qualitative study, making it algorithmic, and extending to<br/>beyond two solutions. The three classes of problems in this award have classical algorithms that span a wide variety of techniques such as randomized local search, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms and linear and semidefinite programming. The study of diverse versions of these problems will enable the new style of optimization to be applied to problems with inherently different structures. For Task A, given the<br/>historical importance of SAT in the field of computer science and the plethora of known reductions from SAT to other problems, any results on computing diverse solutions to SAT have the potential to be applied to many other NP-complete problems. Tasks B and C will help identify similarities and differences in techniques for solving diverse versions of combinatorial problems from those for solving geometric problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lithography enables creation of detailed patterns and features needed for making integrated circuits (ICs). This process uses a thin layer of material, called a resist, which when exposed to light undergoes chemical reactions that persist after subsequent developing processes. To meet the demand for smaller, more powerful chips, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light is now used in lithography. However, a major challenge with EUV lithography is finding new resists that are highly sensitive to this light and can create clear, precise patterns. One solution being explored is using materials that contain metals, as they can absorb EUV light better than elements used to make polymers, such as carbon and hydrogen. Although these metal-based resists can help create better patterns, they also need to be produced in a way that is environmentally friendly, with less waste and lower impact on the environment. This Future Manufacturing Seed Grant (FMSG) research project aims to develop a new process for creating these metal-based resists that is solvent-free and more ecofriendly. This advancement could lead to a new fabrication method for semiconductor devices, leading to more powerful, efficient, and reliable electronics. It also has the potential to boost the economy, create new jobs, and make US manufacturing more competitive in the global market. The project involves several academic partners, including Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University, and Stony Brook University, along with an international collaboration with Spain and participation from the US microelectronics industry. It also offers hands-on training in semiconductor technology for students, creating valuable opportunities for local communities and schools.<br/><br/>The foundation of this project is based on the recent discovery by team-members of an entirely solvent-free (dry) process for making EUV resists based on both the dry deposition and dry development of a new class of metal-organic resists: amorphous metal imidazolate films. This is the first fully documented non-plasma-based all-dry process capable of producing high fidelity patterns from metal-containing resists in the open literature. Consequently, it has the potential to meet the technological demands of ICs while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact of EUV lithography through waste reduction. The eco-friendly manufacturing process is critically dependent upon a dry development step that occurs by chemically selective etching of amorphous metal imidazolate films, while amorphous metal imidazolate resists exposed to electron irradiation are inert to dry development, forming the basis of this patterning technology. Crucially, this all-dry process avoids the unwanted and indiscriminate physical sputtering effects associated with traditional equipment intensive plasma-based processes (e.g., Reactive Ion Etching). However, the underlying chemical reactions associated with dry development as well as the electron-induced reactions that render irradiated amorphous metal imidazolate films inert to dry development are unclear. This project proposes to address these knowledge gaps by generating fundamental scientific insights at the molecular level. Machine Learning coupled to this new knowledge looks to enable resist performance optimization and establish the potential and environmental impact of this all-dry process towards industrial implementation. Specifically, the project aims to: (i) deposit amorphous metal imidazolate films by molecular layer deposition that are more EUV sensitive; (ii) identify eco-friendly alternatives to current fluorinated dry developers; (iii) develop a fundamental understanding of the manufacturing steps; (iv) obtain resist metrics by means of electron beam and  EUV lithography, assisted by Machine Learning; (iv) perform initial process assessment and Life Cycle Analysis to optimize resist performance metrics while reducing environmental impacts.<br/><br/>This Future Manufacturing award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Chemical, Bioenginnering, Environmental and Transport (CBET), Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) Communication Systems (ECCS) divisions in the Engineering directorate (ENG).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research examines whether or not longer waits result in adverse  health outcomes and higher health spending. The research framework will also help us understand whether and how specific interventions (by hospitals systems, health insurers, or governments) can minimize the costs to patients from waiting. The researchers measure waiting times for more than a dozen distinct medical procedures including cataract surgeries, hip and knee replacements, and cardiac bypass surgeries. They find evidence that patients who face longer wait times experience worse outcomes, as measured by higher rates of returning to the hospital for follow-up care, higher total medical spending in hospitals, and greater use of opioid prescriptions for pain. The results of their data analysis are used to understand the interaction between health care markets and health insurance markets. Broader impacts of this research include helping individuals, businesses, and governments understand these linked markets.<br/><br/>The researchers advance our understanding by methodological innovation in data construction and research design. They build a new measure of waiting times using insurance claims data. The researchers apply machine learning tools to detect the likelihood of surgical care based on patients? diagnoses, on the tests and imaging procedures they undergo, and on prescription drugs they fill. This data richness also allows the researchers to engage with the endogenous nature of wait times. Specifically, they exploit variation in demand for surgeries and surgeons over time within an insurance network. Network congestion serves as an instrumental variable that shifts waiting times, allowing the research team to identify the causal effect of wait times on health and spending outcomes. Importantly, the causal effects appear heterogeneous across patient types, pointing to potential misallocation in surgical wait times: patients who experience the worst treatment effects from waiting do not necessarily experience the shortest waits. The researchers then combine claims data with a structural economic model governing how households choose insurance plans and how patients choose providers given an insurance network. The model estimates can be used simulate the effects of changes in the regulatory or business environment, such as changes to a state?s network adequacy laws. In the researchers? framework, multiple players in the market can react strategically to a change in the law: patients might re-match to new providers under such a policy, and payers might adjust their insurance premiums to cover added costs from maintaining a larger network. The researchers can thus quantify changes to patient outcomes in a way that accounts for the supply responses of players in the marketplace.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the society sees increasing use of digitally interconnected devices and systems, the need for secure and user-friendly authentication methods is more critical than ever. Existing methods, such as passwords, fingerprints, and facial recognition, are incompatible with wearable technologies. This project investigates a new approach using physiological signals to enable a continuous time-efficient authentication method that will facilitate a secure and seamless user experience. The broader impacts of this work are substantial: it will advance cybersecurity, protect user privacy, and support smart healthcare by greatly improving the reliability and accessibility of wearable technologies. Moreover, this project includes a plan of extensive education and workforce development activities. The investigators will create advanced interdisciplinary learning opportunities at both Michigan Technological University (MTU) and Louisiana State University (LSU) to engage undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research across electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, signal processing, machine learning, intelligent systems, and data science. By training students with the interdisciplinary technical skills for high-tech industries, this project will contribute to the development of the nation's future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The research of this project will explore the use of multispectral photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for biometric authentication through custom-designed wearable devices. Unlike prevalent biometrics such as fingerprints and facial images which are not suitable for continuous data acquisition, PPG signals can be collected in real time through tiny skin-contact sensors. This feature enables the development of smart biometric systems for continuous and unobtrusive operations, making them well-suited for wearable applications. The goal of this project is to design novel, accurate, reliable, and secure authentication mechanisms using short-duration transient physiological signals collected from wearable devices. The research will investigate new signal processing and machine learning approaches to overcome key challenges, such as limited training data, time-varying signal quality, and the need for continuous classification with temporally evolving data streams. The research tasks include: (1) modeling and analysis of multispectral transient PPG signals; (2) design of novel algorithms for user identification and authentication in real time; (3) creation of adaptive learning models for continuous user-independent/user-dependent classification, and (4) integration of these models in a wearable prototype platform for evaluation in real-word scenarios. The investigators will also address fundamental challenges in signal processing, such as how to effectively identify, extract, and characterize short-duration transient biological signals and determine the signal qualities of sparse and/or noisy data and how to identify the motion artifacts and process them appropriately. The expected outcomes of this research project include new theoretical insights, algorithms, and system architectures that will advance the state of the arts in biometric authentication, signal analysis and processing, and wearable sensing.

However, there are still significant challenges in learning the distinct technologies and pedagogical approaches required to successfully integrate these types of modeling into classroom instruction. This project seeks to develop new technological and pedagogical frameworks that can be used to link these two forms of modeling, lowering barriers and offering multiple points for entry into computing for both teachers and students. In this project, middle school students will explore environmental science using data modeling and agent-based modeling. They will also learn about STEM career pathways through sessions with computational environmental scientists. By connecting these practicing scientists with middle school students, the project will introduce computing as relevant and important, model science careers as meaningful, and foster a sense of shared identity for students. Targeting middle school is crucial because this is when students? career aspirations are shaped, and when their STEM interest and participation drop steeply.  <br/><br/>The project will design three technology-rich units that integrate data and computational modeling to explore environmental issues using two existing free, web-based software tools that are already used by many middle school students and teachers. The Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP) is a free educational app for data analysis; Modeling + Data (MoDa) is a platform for students to easily program ABMs using domain-specific blocks, and compare them with real-world data for validation. Both tools were developed through prior NSF awards. The developed ?Zoom-in on Science sessions? learning program will introduce students to the nature of computational sciences and career pathways in the computational sciences by bringing environmental scientists to classrooms in person or virtually. Using design-based research methodologies, artifact analysis, surveys, interviews, and screen recordings/classroom observations, the project team will study strategies to broaden participation in computing through consequential content and integrated mentorship by addressing the questions i) How do curricular units focused on environmental issues engage students in computing practices to generate scientific explanations? And ii) How do these activities, integrated with Zoom-in-on Science sessions, impact students? self-efficacy, attributed values, and sense of identity towards science and computing? The project aims to involve 10 in-service teachers and directly impact approximately 500 students from 4 partnering middle schools.

These include their large body size with thick fat layer, streamlined head to help dive after prey, and most-noticeable their white fur. While other species of bears live in tropical or temperate environments, polar bears adapted to the extreme low temperatures of the Arctic with novel ways to absorb solar radiation or retain internal body heat.  Three of these thermoregulatory adaptations within the skin or hair include: light hair color, dark skin color, and insulating hollow hair. To identify the genes responsible for these traits, DNA, RNA, proteins, and tissue structure of polar bears will be compared to both the brown/grizzly bear and American black bear. Further, the rate of hair heating and cooling, and energy transfer at the hair-skin boundary will be measured and modeled with the aim of developing novel nanoscale materials. Thus, the project will yield new insights into how mammals remain warm in extreme cold environments. Similar pigmentation and hair structural variation have evolved in other Arctic mammals; thus, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these traits will provide a starting point to investigate convergence. Research results will be translated into educational materials appropriate for K-12 students and distributed to zoos with polar bears, as zoos are often the only opportunity people have to observe these animals. Finally, the project will train scientists in effective science communication and reach non-expert audiences through public outreach.<br/><br/>Arctic species must adapt to the extreme temperatures of their environment. This research focuses on skin and hair traits associated with thermoregulatory adaptation.  Comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and histological staining of skin tissue between polar bears and two temperate species, brown and American black bears, will determine the cellular basis for light hair and dark skin. Specifically, the abundance and location of melanocytes will be characterized, then changes in gene expression among bear species that can account for differences in cellular location will be identified. Beyond pigmentation differences, polar bear hair has a hollow center thought to increase the insulating capacity of the fur. To identify the genes that underly this trait, protein abundance within hair will be compared among species. Ancestral recombination graphs will be constructed to quantify when during the evolutionary history of polar bears this adaptation arose. As the hollow hair has distinct applications in creating novel heat retaining nanomaterials, this research will quantify and model thermodynamic properties of the hair and hair-skin interface over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Other patients have extended stays, sometimes multiple days, in an area of the hospital that is not ideal for them, such as in the emergency department. This incompatibility between needs and available space is causing significant revenue loss and harming patients. This solution is designed to provide decision support on where and when each potential patient could receive care and to make limited hospital capacity available for patients who need it most.

As DNNs become increasingly integrated into critical applications, ensuring their accuracy and robustness is essential. While testing is a widely used quality assurance method, strong performance on test data does not necessarily indicate that a DNN is robust or generalizable. In recent years, real-world failures--ranging from algorithmic bias to life-threatening errors--have highlighted the need for systematic test quality assessment. Mutation analysis, a technique originally developed for traditional software testing, has emerged as a promising approach for evaluating DNN test data quality. However, all forms of DNN mutation analysis remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical adoption. This project proposes novel techniques to increase mutation testing performance through approximation techniques based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). By making DNN mutation analysis more efficient, this research will enhance the reliability of deep learning systems while significantly reducing the computational burden of quality assurance.<br/><br/>This project introduces several techniques for accelerating both model-level and source-level DNN mutation analysis, making it a more practical quality assurance method. Model-level mutation analysis involves creating small variations, or mutants, of a trained DNN by modifying its internal structure and observing how these changes affect its behavior. Source-level mutation analysis, on the other hand, mutates the code or training data used to build the DNN before retraining it from scratch. Both approaches require running a large number of mutants, making them computationally intensive. To address this challenge, the project will explore Fourier analysis, a mathematical technique that transforms data into frequency components, as a way to efficiently compare model behaviors and compress mutation-related computations. Additionally, methods such as mutant grouping--which clusters similar mutants to reduce redundant computations--and memorization--which stores and reuses previously computed results--will be adapted from traditional software testing to deep learning. For source-level mutation analysis, the project will investigate techniques based on training data selection (i.e., identifying the most informative data points), data distillation (i.e., compressing large datasets into smaller, high-quality subsets), and active learning (i.e., prioritizing the most uncertain or impactful data points for retraining).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viruses play multiple and dynamic roles in the fate of organic matter and the flow of energy in the ocean. Arguably, the least studied of those roles is the direct transfer of nutrients and energy up the food web through grazing on virus particles ? virovory. This study investigates how virovory impacts the cycling of organic matter and its contribution to grazers? nutrition varies in time and space across distinct microbe groups. The work is timely and complementary to large-scale projects to create a predictive understanding of the ocean?s carbon cycle and transform our understanding of the impacts of viruses in the marine environment beyond their role as parasites.

Quantifying virus decay and removal is critical to constrain infection dynamics, a first step to quantify the ?shunt? and ?shuttle.? Virovory is a potentially dominant virus loss process, a source of nutrition to grazers, and a significant food web pathway that redirects nutrients and energy to upper trophic levels. However, the magnitude of each of these virally-mediated processes of regeneration, sequestration, and trophic transfer remains largely unresolved. This research team uses laboratory incubations of natural marine microbial communities collected on different seasons from oligotrophic and eutrophic environments with isotope-labeled viral particles and mathematical ecosystem models to test the following hypotheses: H1. Virovory is a natural sink of marine viruses that rivals all other viral losses combined. H2. Nutrient transfer from large enveloped dsDNA eukaryotic viruses is higher than from smaller virus particles. H3.

This technology was engineered to address the acute need for (and conspicuous absence of) intrinsically lubricious, elastomer materials in the today?s medical plastics marketplace. Medical device manufacturers produce millions of elastomeric devices designed for intimate contact with biological tissues and fluids, but rely heavily on the use of costly, capital- and labor-intensive coating processes to achieve the sustained, biologically inert, surface lubricity. Catheter systems designed to enable minimally invasive surgical access to remote intravascular spaces constitute one such set of important examples. However, even routine catheters designed for biological fluid collection, delivery and drainage, and day-to-day healthcare consumables such as medical tubing, containers, and bags - all rely on combined elasticity and biologically non-reactive surface hydrophilicity as key components of their design and function.

Most semiconductors are made of hard materials, such as silicon, that are expensive to process and manufacture.  This project explores the properties of plastic semiconductors that are lightweight, flexible and inexpensive to process into devices.  The main challenge facing the development of plastic semiconductors is that it is not as easy to control their electrical properties by doping (the addition or removal of electrons to the semiconductor) as with inorganic semiconductors.  This is because the structure of the plastic materials changes upon doping.  This project aims to understand how those structure changes control electrical conductivity, and to use that understanding to controllably produce plastic semiconductors with improved conductivity.  The efforts will include using new processing methods to allow dopant molecules to be precisely added to the plastic semiconductors at desired molecular locations, and using the structure of the polymer to drive the doping process.  The project is a collaboration between researchers who have complimentary expertise in understanding the structure and physical properties of plastic semiconductors and the electronic and device properties of the materials. In addition to scientific advances, this multidisciplinary project trains undergraduate and graduate students in areas of national need and helps bring experiments on related topics (harvesting energy from sunlight and nanoscale materials) to Los Angeles area high schools.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract  <br/>Conjugated polymers have numerous potential uses because they combine the mechanical properties of plastics with the electrical properties of semiconductors.  When doped by strong oxidizing agents, their conductivity can be changed by orders of magnitude, but interactions with the dopant counterion and dopant-induced changes in morphology can limit the final carrier mobility.  This project aims to understand how the choice of dopant counterion size and shape, along with changes to the degree of polymer crystallinity and crystal structure in the doped state, all work together to determine the electrical properties of doped conjugated polymer films.  The project will accomplish this using both chemical and electrochemical doping with a variety of counterions and dopants.  Structural aspects of the doped films will be determined using synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction experiments.  Electrical properties will be determined via temperature-dependent four-point probe electrical conductivity, Hall effect, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy experiments.  The project will also take advantage of rub-aligned films in which the polymer chains all point in the same direction, creating anisotropic conductivity.  The first specific question to be addressed by the project is the connection between counterion size and shape, and electrical properties.  This will be accomplished by doping the same series of polymers using a series of counterions whose sizes vary by nearly an order of magnitude, directly elucidating correlations between the ion size, local structural change, and carrier mobility.  Another specific question to be answered is how the energetics of crystallization (either the crystal-to-crystal phase transformations or the gain or loss of crystallinity upon doping) alter the propensity of conjugated polymers to be doped.  This will be accomplished by using blends of polymers that show different propensity for dopant-induced ordering or disordering.  A third main question that will be targeted by the project is the role of the local dielectric environment in doping.  This will be accomplished by adding electrolytes to the solutions used for doping, with the aim of altering the propensity for doping.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Frontier regions, where disparate groups come into contact, offer the best contexts to study these processes in pre-modern eras. When disparate groups interact, alternative organizational and economic traditions must be negotiated. Archaeologists infer that when these processes result in the creation and maintenance of material and immaterial boundaries at local scales they correspond to group formation. A key question is whether group formation results from categories being imposed by the more powerful group, or if intra-community dynamics of the subordinate group play a more significant role. How these scenarios develop across generations allows archaeologists to reconstruct strategies of assimilation, hybridization and/or resistance by the subordinate group. The project trains a graduate student in archaeological science.<br/><br/>To reconstruct these transformations, this research evaluates technological and stylistic variation in ceramics over time as a proxy for understanding change and group formation. Five sites are excavated to collect data from two recognized phases of occupation. Analyses assess high- and low-visibility attributes of ceramic manufacture.

This question will be addressed by a new framework that will incorporate realistic market features and explore their implications for short- and long-run equilibria, optimal capacity prices, and net benefits of market designs. These features include battery storage and variable wind and solar resources, as well as risk-aversion, incomplete markets, transmission congestion, optimal demand management, and other features. The new framework will use a unique set of analytical and computational methods to solve for Nash equilibria in market models that are unique in their combining representations of stochastic demand processes, market participant risk attitudes, and simultaneous consideration of the role of regulators, market operators, suppliers, and consumers. The proposed framework can be simplified to have tractable dynamics, and also is general enough to incorporate all the desired features of real markets, including battery storage, variable renewables, transmission limits, evolution of capacities, and optimal demand management. The goal will then be to find Nash equilibria among the supply capacities of producers, together with the regulator's optimal capacity payments that maximize net market benefits. The aim is to compare energy-only and capacity markets, find the combination of capacity payments and price caps that maximize the reliability and net benefits of the market. In the near future, the demands upon the grid are expected to dramatically increase, as more applications switch from fossil-fuels to electricity (e.g., electric vehicles), and new uses appear (e.g., AI, bitcoin mining). Therefore, it is vital to study how to keep supply reliable and affordable, and desired generation facilities financially sustainable (in a Nash equilibrium sense), while achieving social goals of renewable power by providing incentives to the producers to ""do the right thing.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Brummond of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) is studying the Advancement of a Mechanism-Driven Predictive Model for the Catalyst-Controlled Asymmetric Rh(I)-Catalyzed Pauson-Khand Reaction (PKR). This project will deliver a predictive model for identifying effective chiral PKR catalysts for specific enynes and with high substrate generality. Key PKR reactivity and selectivity drivers will be realized through a Reaction Development Workflow involving four steps: Existing Knowledge, Dataset Design, Data Collection, and Model Training. The milestones for each step will be achieved through synergetic activities involving co-PIs at Pitt and Merck, Inc utilizing synthesis (e.g., experimental yield and enantiomeric excess data obtained via conventional wet-lab and Merck high-throughput experimentation), computation (e.g., TSs and descriptors obtained via DFT), and data science tools (e.g., multivariate linear regression, random forest models). Computed and experimental descriptors will be used to develop machine learning models to quantitatively predict ee and yield of asymmetric PKRs with different substrates, chiral ligands, and experimental conditions (temperature, solvent, CO concentration). New mechanistic insight will be uncovered on the complex, multi-step process of transition metal-catalyzed PKR, for which the impact of the catalyst and substrate properties on reactivity and selectivity are currently not well understood. Investigations will focus on introducing key stereocenters in non-racemic chiral building blocks for high-value PKRs. Mechanistic insights will improve model performance both by allowing the model to identify the preferred mechanism under a given reaction conditions (i.e., whether a 4-coordinated or 5-coordinated pathway is favored), and by including reaction-specific descriptors that will be more effective to describe catalyst and substrate effects on reactivity and selectivity (e.g., substrate binding energy, ligand/CO exchange energy, and ligand dispersion descriptors). Predictive models for a catalyst-controlled Rh(I)-catalyzed asymmetric PKR of enynes will deliver a unique and reliable way to synthesize chiral non-racemic cyclopentenones and enable widespread integration into crucial societal ecosystems such as the discovery and development of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, organic materials, and natural product synthesis. The complexity of the Rh(I)-catalyzed asymmetric PKR make it an ideal case study for the development of predictive models for reactivity and selectivity; this work will provide a foundation for mechanism-driven model development for other transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric carbocyclizations, promoting inclusion of these complexity-generating transformations in the design and synthesis of complex molecular targets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include their large body size with thick fat layer, streamlined head to help dive after prey, and most-noticeable their white fur. While other species of bears live in tropical or temperate environments, polar bears adapted to the extreme low temperatures of the Arctic with novel ways to absorb solar radiation or retain internal body heat.  Three of these thermoregulatory adaptations within the skin or hair include: light hair color, dark skin color, and insulating hollow hair. To identify the genes responsible for these traits, DNA, RNA, proteins, and tissue structure of polar bears will be compared to both the brown/grizzly bear and American black bear. Further, the rate of hair heating and cooling, and energy transfer at the hair-skin boundary will be measured and modeled with the aim of developing novel nanoscale materials. Thus, the project will yield new insights into how mammals remain warm in extreme cold environments. Similar pigmentation and hair structural variation have evolved in other Arctic mammals; thus, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these traits will provide a starting point to investigate convergence. Research results will be translated into educational materials appropriate for K-12 students and distributed to zoos with polar bears, as zoos are often the only opportunity people have to observe these animals. Finally, the project will train scientists in effective science communication and reach non-expert audiences through public outreach.<br/><br/>Arctic species must adapt to the extreme temperatures of their environment. This research focuses on skin and hair traits associated with thermoregulatory adaptation.  Comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and histological staining of skin tissue between polar bears and two temperate species, brown and American black bears, will determine the cellular basis for light hair and dark skin. Specifically, the abundance and location of melanocytes will be characterized, then changes in gene expression among bear species that can account for differences in cellular location will be identified. Beyond pigmentation differences, polar bear hair has a hollow center thought to increase the insulating capacity of the fur. To identify the genes that underly this trait, protein abundance within hair will be compared among species. Ancestral recombination graphs will be constructed to quantify when during the evolutionary history of polar bears this adaptation arose. As the hollow hair has distinct applications in creating novel heat retaining nanomaterials, this research will quantify and model thermodynamic properties of the hair and hair-skin interface over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current 3D printing methods such as stereolithography and digital light processing (DLP) can manufacture freeform polymer matrix composites with randomly oriented heterogeneous fillers or fibers, but they have not been studied for creating connected and continuous fiber composite structures. Continuous fiber composites in industry are utilized for enhancing strength and toughness, as well as for imparting certain thermal, electrical, or ionic transport functionalities into a polymer matrix composite. Continuous filler composites are typically made via molding techniques with significant manual effort. There is an urgent need for further scientific exploration in utilizing continuous fillers to maximize electrical and thermal performance and efficiency in freeform fabricated polymer matrix composites. The approach investigated in this project combines multiple manufacturing principles: acoustic manipulation (via acoustophoresis) to agglomerate and align discrete particles in a polymer vat, photopolymerization (via DLP) to define the geometry of the component in each layer, and photonic sintering (via intense pulsed light sintering, IPLS) to create connected and fused fibers from the particles aligned through acoustic manipulation. Successful completion of the project looks to enable a new freeform manufacturing approach for heterogeneous materials, and the approach could be extended to include other fillers such as piezoelectric materials or ionically conductive materials to realize advanced functionalities. <br/><br/>	Apart from acoustophoresis for particle alignment, DLP printing and IPLS have not been explored as an integrated process due to their significant processing differences. Their joint effect on the process performance is not well understood. While IPLS utilizes high energy dosages (J/cm2 - kJ/cm2) and broad wavelength spectral distribution during illumination, DLP printing, meanwhile, utilizes relatively low energy (mJ/cm2) and a very narrow wavelength spectral distribution to induce polymerization of the intended geometry. This EAGER research project explores their joint effect to synergistically process two heterogeneous material types: polymer resin (low temperature processing, low light energy) and metal (locally high temperature processing, high light energy). To combine DLP printing and IPLS, photopolymerization will be induced via red light illumination, with IPLS being performed via UV/Blue light illumination. Additionally fundamental relationships look to be established between acoustic stimulus (frequency, amplitude, duration), embedded particle properties (size, concentration within resin, and shape), and would-be sintered fiber dimensions (width, height, spacing).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This puts these children at risk for delayed communication development compared to hearing children or deaf children of deaf parents. These communication delays may lead to social isolation, mental health issues, and lowered quality of life. Using educational games to help bridge these gaps has been proposed, but little educational software is designed for American Sign Language (ASL) and even less for sign languages of other countries. This project's goal is to create a framework for mobile device developers to use on-device sign language recognition to develop educational software for Deaf children and their hearing parents. The plan is to develop educational software, tools, datasets and machine learning models and release them via open-source so the research can be replicated for other sign languages world-wide. To establish that the tools can generalize across languages, the project team will develop versions of the software for both ASL and for Indian Sign Language (ISL). ISL is both less studied than ASL and has a large user population, making it an excellent second language to work in. To ensure the work is well-suited to the needs of deaf people, the work will be done in close collaboration with the Deaf community, and with participation of Deaf student researchers. <br/><br/>The main technical focus of the project is to develop a framework that allows the rapid development of educational software that (a) can target multiple sign languages and (b) can be practically deployed without specialized hardware or setup requirements. The concrete educational software to be developed is based on two educational games for sign language previously developed by the research team that use word- and phrase-level ASL recognition in their gameplay. One key part of the project is the creation of robust datasets of ASL and ISL use, including fingerspelling, word, and phrase-level expressions. These datasets will both drive the creation of new recognition models and support linguistic analysis of ASL use. A second key element is designing novel algorithms for both recognizing sign language that are accurate enough to be useful and cope with disfluencies, flexible enough to support both adult and children's signing, and efficient enough to run on tablets and smartphones. The third key element is developing game design principles for educational software for sign language: avoiding the need for English-based instruction, appropriately responding to both well-formed and disfluent signing, and ways to assess and improve both users' receptivity and expressiveness around sign language. The research team will assess the effectiveness of both the software itself, in terms of its effects on children's language development, and the framework, in terms of its ability to be useful to other languages, developers, and researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials possess unique combinations of properties: they conduct electricity exceptionally well, interact strongly with light to enable energy conversion, and can be flexed or bent without breaking. These extraordinary characteristics position MXenes as important materials for advancing electronic devices and robotic systems. However, current manufacturing methods produce MXenes with imperfect surfaces, which limits their performance. The research will employ advanced fabrication techniques, artificial intelligence, and innovative engineering approaches to reveal the true capabilities of these materials. The research will focus on three main objectives: 1) developing new methods to create pristine MXenes with clean, controlled surfaces, 2) using artificial intelligence to quickly analyze and understand these materials, and 3) enabling new types of electronic devices and soft robots that take advantage of MXenes' intrinsic properties.

The scientific problem centers on creating and studying pristine MXenes - a goal that has remained elusive due to limitations in current fabrication and analysis methods. To overcome these challenges, the project will develop atomic-precise fabrication methods, including plasma-assisted atomic layer etching and chemical vapor deposition, to create pristine MXenes with controlled surface chemistry and large crystalline domains. For efficient materials development, machine learning algorithms integrated with large language models will enable rapid and precise analysis of material structure and properties. These advanced synthesis and characterization capabilities will allow systematic investigation of previously unexplored characteristics of pristine MXenes, including electron transport and light-matter interactions. Through comprehensive study of these well-controlled materials, this research will establish benchmark measurements of MXenes' intrinsic properties and will provide critical insights into how surface chemistry influences their electronic and optical behaviors, advancing the scientific understanding needed for next-generation electronics and robotics.

The research team will develop macromolecular architectures that enable control over exciton dynamics and spin interactions in radical-containing polymers. The research will focus on designing novel multifunctional systems that can harness high spin polarization of the triplet pair multiexciton state to achieve enhanced energy conversion, spin polarization transfer, and optoelectronic applications. The project is structured around two primary objectives: (1) designing and characterizing multiexciton dynamics in radical-containing polymers, and (2) determining the spin and population dynamics to demonstrate the efficacy of spin polarization transfer in these systems. These activities will address significant hurdles hindering substantial progress in applications of SF that span from the lack of fundamental guidelines of multichromophore design in macromolecules to the orchestration of spin polarization transfer pathways to stable radicals. Traditional studies have focused on generating multiple excitons from a single photon, but this project differentiates itself by emphasizing the control and utilization of spin dynamics for energy conversion and quantum information processes. The project?s success will lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions between triplet pairs and radical spin centers, establishing new paradigms in multiexciton chemistry and molecular spintronics.

Variability in plant growing environments, including changes in temperature, have been linked to severe local outbreaks for various pathogens. The most effective way to control plant diseases is the use of disease-resistant cultivars. While current breeding programs evaluate disease resistant cultivars for their durability against concurrent pathogen populations, the sensitivity of plant resistance genes to growing temperatures is rarely considered while assessing their durability. The goal of this project is to develop crops with stable immunity that can tackle the simultaneous challenge of evolving pathogen pressure and suboptimal plant growth temperatures. This project led by a team of scientists from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany has the potential to develop crop varieties that are tolerant to changing growing temperatures and outcomes from this work has the potential to ensure future food security. This project will also support continued efforts by the team to provide STEM-based research experiences for high school students, and outreach events for the public in Alabama and Virginia. Graduate students and research associates that are a part of this project will be actively involved in these outreach events aimed to raise awareness of how plant growth temperatures impact plant health and disease pressure. <br/><br/>Predicting plant disease outcomes in the face of projected suboptimal growing conditions is challenging for multiple reasons. Host responses to multiple simultaneous stresses are simply not additive. Multivariate selection pressures brought about by temperature fluctuations alter ecological, epidemiological, physiological and evolutionary processes in the host as well as pathogen populations and alter their responses due to trade-offs among traits under selection, thereby altering host-pathogen dynamics. The proposed work will utilize field and growth chamber experiments in parallel to understand how pathogen and plant carrying different resistance genes respond to temperature alteration.  This project will investigate multi-generation host-pathoadaptation and assess fitness trade-offs that constrain the evolution in both plant and pathogen. The project will make explicit links between physiological and genetic processes in host and pathogen that inform potential candidates for breeding programs to make heat resilient and disease resistant crops. The project will evaluate temperature sensitivity of resistance genes in pepper and tomato in terms of their stability, function and alteration of immune pathways. This study has direct translational relevance for durable management of resistance genes in the context of variable environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viruses play multiple and dynamic roles in the fate of organic matter and the flow of energy in the ocean. Arguably, the least studied of those roles is the direct transfer of nutrients and energy up the food web through grazing on virus particles ? virovory. This study investigates how virovory impacts the cycling of organic matter and its contribution to grazers? nutrition varies in time and space across distinct microbe groups. The work is timely and complementary to large-scale projects to create a predictive understanding of the ocean?s carbon cycle and transform our understanding of the impacts of viruses in the marine environment beyond their role as parasites. This project engages and trains early career scientists and students as scientific partners, providing professional skills critical for careers inside and outside academia, such as science communication and reporting to various audiences. The project also includes participation in STEM programs for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>Virus particles and infections play a role in the biological cycling and sequestration of organic matter by increasing the flow of organic matter to the dissolved phase, fueling the microbial loop??viral shunt? and releasing compounds during host cell lysis that enhance the formation of particle aggregates and the sinking of organic matter through the biological pump??viral shuttle.? Quantifying virus decay and removal is critical to constrain infection dynamics, a first step to quantify the ?shunt? and ?shuttle.? Virovory is a potentially dominant virus loss process, a source of nutrition to grazers, and a significant food web pathway that redirects nutrients and energy to upper trophic levels. However, the magnitude of each of these virally-mediated processes of regeneration, sequestration, and trophic transfer remains largely unresolved. This research team uses laboratory incubations of natural marine microbial communities collected on different seasons from oligotrophic and eutrophic environments with isotope-labeled viral particles and mathematical ecosystem models to test the following hypotheses: H1. Virovory is a natural sink of marine viruses that rivals all other viral losses combined. H2. Nutrient transfer from large enveloped dsDNA eukaryotic viruses is higher than from smaller virus particles. H3. Virovory contributes more nutrition for heterotrophic protists in permanently or seasonally oligotrophic waters than in eutrophic marine ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will implement quantum-theoretical calculations of chemical reactions that would not occur without a magnetic interaction between the spins of the electrons and the spin of the nucleus of a heavy element in these molecules. This magnetic interaction is called hyperfine coupling (HFC). The resulting theoretical method developments will be used to investigate the magnetic isotope effect (MIE) in reactions of small molecules containing mercury. Phenomena such as the ?magnetic compass? in migratory birds may also be facilitated by such processes, and therefore the research has the potential to solve long-standing scientific mysteries. A greater understanding of spin-forbidden reactions and whether they can be facilitated by HFC will have broad-ranging impacts across various scientific disciplines, from chemistry to environmental sciences. The proposed research will be integrated exclusively into open-source quantum chemistry software. The methodologies will also be integrated into STEM education through participation in the REU program, outreach lectures, and involvement of a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar in the research. <br/><br/>The team will develop electronic-structure and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) methodology to simulate spin-forbidden reactions driven by HFC. Existing quantum dynamics methods lack a proper spin-independent (scalar effects, SR) and spin-dependent (spin-orbit coupling, SOC) relativistic treatment, preventing the simultaneous evaluation of SOC and HFC interactions, thus limiting the assessment of intersystem crossing in radical pair intermediates. The limitations of quantum dynamics in explaining spin-forbidden reactions are highlighted by the observable photochemical mercury MIE. The objectives are: (1) Expand the current implementation of Exact 2-component (X2C) relativistic HFC in OpenMolcas at the multireference level to include multiple excited states with different multiplicities; (2) Develop and implement the calculation of the matrix elements of the total HFC; (3) Incorporate HFC in the simulation of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics over long time scales using the SHARC program as interfaced with OpenMolcas. The outcomes of this work will directly impact our understanding of photochemically derived isotope effects observed in natural samples and thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of important environmental processes.

Traditional simulation approaches struggle to parallelize efficiently, especially for large systems like the Eastern Interconnection with over 70,000 buses. The emergence of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) models offers promising alternatives for accelerating complex simulations. The main idea is to train neural network surrogates of numerical models, and once pre-trained, the networks can generate simulations with much faster speed and efficient scaling. This project develops a novel AI-surrogate enhanced cyberinfrastructure for accelerating power grid simulations. The resulting framework will lower barriers for power grid engineers to adopt AI surrogates, enabling interdisciplinary research and education between power systems and computer science domains.<br/><br/>The project will deliver three key innovations: (1) program-behavior analysis to identify optimal code regions for AI surrogate replacement; (2) semi-automatic AI surrogate construction that incorporates domain-specific physical knowledge; and (3) heterogeneous computing with multi-fidelity modeling that dynamically balances AI surrogates and traditional models across computing resources. The methodological approach combines static and dynamic code analysis, neural network training with physical constraints, and adaptive scheduling algorithms for CPU/GPU resources.

This three-year project is designed to accelerate progress across the quantum  education community by amplifying its efforts through dissemination, cohesion, and collaboration. The project will also allow expansion of the Key Concepts for K-12 education, so that the community can work towards integrating QISE into early education. Activities include a website that serves as a hub for the wider QISE education ecosystem, and a plan for a cohesive set of workshops to further the development of age-appropriate K-12 QISE education resources. Transdisciplinary and convergent connections across the QISE education ecosystem spanning K-12, academia, government, industry, professional societies, and informal education organizations are a central element of this effort. QISE draws from the fields with some of the lowest percentages of underrepresented minority and female students, and this program involves mechanisms to increase participation of underrepresented groups in QISE.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>QISE education and the associated research is distinct from quantum mechanics, mathematics, or computer science, but it is not its own field. This activity bootstraps a community of educators, education researchers, and QIS professionals to further develop QISE education, seed new efforts and magnify research in this critical area. Core research and technological progress in QISE depends on supporting this community. Moreover, planned activities enable the education community to take concrete collaborative steps towards making changes to curricula and implementing tools that increase awareness, intuition, and literacy in quantum information science at the K-12 level and ultimately across all ages and learning environments. Planned activities and outputs are designed to be inclusive, and to build connections with underrepresented groups in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Broadening access to QISE for students of different backgrounds, and increased female and minority representation at the college level are also the goals of this work. An evaluator will assess the project activities and deliverables using methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data analytics collected from web logs. Given the emphasis on facilitating connections across QIS education ecosystem, evaluation protocols will be developed based on a framework for assessing the attributes of collaborative communities. <br/><br/>This project is partially supported by NSF's Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program, in the Directorate for Education & Human Resources and Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) through the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), Division of Materials Research (DMR) and Division of Physics.

These transparent conductive electrodes offer superior performance at substantially lower cost than existing options based on indium tin oxide. Highly conductive and transparent conductor films enable applications such as current collectors for EMI shielding, flexible energy storage, capacitive touch screens, electrochromic window films, transparent light emitting diodes, solar cells, and more. This project will focus on large-scale production with high throughputs. Existing transparent conductive electrodes largely use indium tin oxide, but indium is a rare earth metal that has been steadily increasing in price as demand increases. Indium is also typically imported. Reducing the dependence on foreign inputs for optoelectronic manufacturing offers commercial and security advantages. While indium tin oxide has been used in some flexible devices, the material is ill-suited for these applications due to its brittleness imposing severe limitations on bend radius and bend cycles. Metal-mesh transparent conductive electrodes do not suffer from these limitations. Thus, a method of cheaply producing flexible transparent conductors will enable the development of smart windows, rollable transparent displays, portable solar panels, and other devices with new form factors. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will (1) develop improved catalytic ink formulations that are compatible with high-speed micropatterning methods and (2) prototype an innovative system for roll-to-roll electroless plating of those catalytic traces with new methods of film conveyance and improved plating-bath control. Capital and operating expenses of existing methods used to make conductive metal micropatterns such as photolithography can be cost prohibitive for many applications and do not scale well. This project aims to eliminate these costly processes and instead use a fully additive process to make the micropatterns. These patterns will then be metalized using electroless plating to obtain conductive metal patterns. The challenge to be solved is that existing manufacturing equipment tends to be unsuitable for roll-to-roll electroless plating of flexible substrates. The modular plating equipment being designed as part of this STTR includes a novel conveyance system that is more compatible with electroless plating baths and new methods of process controls to achieve reliable plating of micro-scale fine metal lines. These new features will maximize flexibility and equipment uptimes. An additional goal is to develop a kit to retrofit existing off-the-shelf equipment to add roll-to-roll capabilities to further reduce equipment cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as presently constructed and regulated, auto insurance monitoring programs do not allow for a full use of individual driving data to price insurance. At the root of this missed opportunity to induce safer roads lie concerns related to data use and privacy. A structure that collects data on driver behavior and shares the data with specific automakers and insurers with drivers? consent could potentially alleviate these privacy concerns while making roads safer. However, to which extent could such a structure contribute meaningfully to increasing road safety? What would the impact be of such a structure on the auto insurance industry? And to which extent would it affect the car manufacturing industry and reshape the conversation around automated driving? Through a series of theoretical and empirical analyses and by engaging the relevant stakeholders, this research will seek to provide answers to these questions. The research will lay the foundation to help inform transportation industry policy making and better road safety management. The research activities will be integrated into teaching and course design, as well as outreach activities for broadening participation in STEM. Research discoveries will be further disseminated through conferences and collaborations with practitioners.<br/><br/>The research centers on two main tasks. First, a mathematical model that captures the impact of information availability on insurance pricing, driver behavior, and aggregate accident probability will be developed. This model will be used to study equilibria that emerge on a road or in a road network when more information about driving behavior is shared. Additionally, market structure, incentives for technology adoption, and the interactions between automakers and insurers will be considered. The outcome of these analyses will be a characterization of an upper bound on the benefits of a more holistic use of driving data in insurance pricing.  Second, a series of interviews with different industry stakeholders will provide insights on attitudes towards removing obstacles to a wider use of driving behavior data in auto insurance. Together, the research will help inform policymaking and data regulations in auto insurance and road safety in the era of connected and automated vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key pathway involved in this process is the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Disruptions in this pathway can lead to harmful inflammation, placental dysfunction, and complications during pregnancy. This project aims to understand how two specific proteins in the JAK/STAT pathway, STAT2 and STAT5B, contribute to the immune processes that support a healthy pregnancy. Through an array of innovative techniques and cutting-edge human placental organoid models, this project will identify key mediators and mechanisms involved in placental development and dysfunction and will expand scientific understanding of the molecular processes that influence reproductive biology and fetal immune development. Outcomes of this research are the first step in developing therapeutics to ensure healthy pregnancies. The project will also provide hands-on training opportunities for students at various educational levels, promoting the development of necessary skills in biomedical research. Thus, this research will aid in developing the STEM workforce for the US bioeconomy.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to bridge the tremendous gap in the fundamental understanding of innate immune signaling at the placenta and to identify the mechanisms associated with placental development and immune dysfunction. The placenta as the interface between mother and fetus is a robust immunological organ and orchestrates key signals necessary to sustain a healthy pregnancy and maintain immune homeostasis necessary for immune protection and tolerance of the HLA-discordant fetus. In a normal, healthy pregnancy a delicate balance of hormones and cytokines regulates JAK/STAT signaling in immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface. This pathway is essential during pregnancy for implantation, placental development, and immunity, however increasing evidence suggests that aberrant JAK/STAT signaling at the placenta is associated with deleterious inflammation and placental dysfunction. Preliminary data suggest that STAT2 signaling promotes anti-inflammatory Th2 responses in placental cells, while STAT5B activity is associated with pro-inflammatory Th1 responses and placental dysfunction. This project will investigate the spatial distribution, activation dynamics, and downstream gene networks associated with STAT2 and STAT5B signaling in human placental cells and organoids. This innovative project will advance the understanding of innate immune signaling at the maternal-fetal interface, identify mechanisms that sustain or threaten normal placental development, and elucidate the impact of placenta immune activation on fetal immunity. Training of students and post-docs will also occur as an important means to develop the next generation of researchers for the bioeconomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As increased electrification and the interconnection of renewables will require a major expansion of the electric transmission grid in the near future, this project will bring transformative change to power system planning with solutions to more intelligently select new transmission line projects for grid expansion. This will be achieved by an innovative methodology leveraging how patterns in the network structure of the grid predict its technical performance. The intellectual merits of this project include demonstrating the performance capability of a transmission expansion planning (TEP) solution framework for ultra-scale problems with algorithms to address both scenario variability and modeling complexity. The broader impacts include supporting electric grid design to reduce renewable curtailments and be more robust to blackouts, along with jumpstarting an open-access digital educational experience that puts students in the power grid operator?s seat to learn more about sustainability and resilience. <br/><br/>The TEP problem has an inherent challenge due to the large combinatorial space of possible expansion options, intensified by the multi-faceted engineering assessment required to realistically evaluate the viability of even one potential solution. Hence very little application of integer programming methods can be seen in practical deployment. This project aims to develop a new framework, applying a paradigm of spatially-embedded complex networks, to approach ultra-scale TEP and overcome fundamental limitations in solver efficiency, breadth of scenario coverage, and depth of modeling. For solver efficiency, the project will develop a multi-layered solver architecture starting with spatially-aware candidate production, feeding to an iterative down-selection with an annealing-inspired metaheuristic and a final integer programming step with bounding that exploits spatial embedding. For scenario breadth, the project will compute grid community structure across thousands of uncertainty scenarios, leading to sensitivities that can inform a TEP solver to select lines that will reduce renewable curtailment throughout the year. Finally, depth of modeling will be addressed by connecting network structural properties with low-order models of voltage- and stability-based transmission limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In arid regions, water is withdrawn from rivers for urban and agricultural use, and river flora and fauna are lost. In arid climate, people also lose ecosystem services, such as cool riparian forests to visit during hot summers. However, recent advances in wastewater treatment allow us to produce high quality treated effluent, which is suitable for restoring flow in dried rivers and for recharging groundwater supplies. In this Biological Research Experiences for Teachers Site (BIORETS) program at the University of Arizona (UA), three cohorts of teacher participants will collaborate with ecologists and natural resource managers to address two main place-based research questions. First, how does the release of effluent affect aquatic and riparian species in and along the Santa Cruz River in southern Arizona? Second, how do ecological communities change over time in these newly flowing ecosystems as plant and animal species return to the river? Teachers will work with academic mentors at UA, as well as with members of the local Tohono O?odham and Pascua Yaqui tribes, to collect and analyze data. Teachers also will develop curricula for their K-12 students, have their students participate in ecological studies during the school year, learn about water resource conservation, and help reinvigorate community connections to the river. <br/> <br/>Historically, treated effluent was generally of poor water quality and it degraded ecological conditions in rivers that received effluent. Although newer wastewater treatment equipment and technology have greatly improved effluent water quality, large knowledge gaps remain regarding how well effluent can mimic ?natural? water, restore ecosystem function, and enhance plant and animal populations in and along arid-land rivers. These gaps are important to address because there are many competing demands for effluent, which could reduce its availability to restore flow in rivers. Additionally, numerous basic ecological processes can be studied in these novel urban ecosystems, including community assembly mechanisms such as species turnover and priority effects. In this BIORETS program at UA, teachers and researchers will quantify community structure of multiple taxonomic groups (aquatic invertebrates, riparian birds and mammals, turtles, and wetland plants) in five rewetted reaches of the river over three years, and compare observed patterns with data collected concurrently from nearby dry reaches. Together, these data will elucidate mechanisms of community assembly in novel ecosystems while also providing municipal managers with real-time ecological data to inform water resource management decisions and enhance water supply sustainability in cities. The results of this research will answer important ecological questions, shape water management decisions in the Santa Cruz basin, and provide a model approach for other cities to adopt for restoring flow in rivers and beneficial ecosystem services for local communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computing has ushered us into a whole new era of possibilities and discoveries as more and more data and computing resources are available. While throwing computational resources at a problem has been a successful initial approach, eventually the efficiency of resources becomes important. Theoretical computer science rigorously studies the difficulties of problems based on resource limitations like time, energy, space, compressibility, input/output, etc. For the text data, space resources and compressibility become important factors. In the field of compressed data structures, the goal is to develop data structures which take space nearly optimal with respect to the best compression while at the same time can answer the queries as fast as the best uncompressed data structure can answer. This project considers parameterized pattern matching problem and constructing compressed index for it. The problem has direct applicability in software plagiarism detection, cloning and versioning systems. Many of the results and components considered in this project are likely good inclusion for course projects and homework problems. The project will support a graduate student. The results of this work will be widely disseminated and published in conferences and journals. <br/><br/>In parameterized pattern matching, the text consists of parameterized characters and static characters. Two strings are parameterized match if there is a bijection between parameterized alphabets of the two strings, which when applied to the characters of one of the strings it becomes equal to the other. A known encoding ?prev? can convert the text (or each suffix of the text) into a canonical form such that two parameterized strings are a match if and only if their ?prev? encoding is the same. In the investigator?s previous work, a Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based approach as well as a Phi-function based approach have been shown to obtain a compact index for the problem. In this project. we aim to: (1) Define entropy-based compression measures for parameterized text and achieve an index with such space occupancies, (2) Explore the construction aspects of parameterized index ? including implementation issues like memory bottleneck and external memory construction, and (3) Obtain best space-time tradeoff results based on combination of Phi function and BWT.

The rapid expansion of technologies such as robotaxis, robovans, and urban air mobility has the potential to reshape future cities and transform urban transportation. However, this transformation brings significant challenges, particularly managing congestion. Without effective ride-pooling operations, a substantial portion of vehicle miles could involve zero-occupancy trips, an unprecedented phenomenon in transportation networks. On the other hand, autonomous fleets offer unique opportunities through their innovative and flexible vehicle designs, as well as centralized control systems that promote scalable shared-ride experiences. Unlike traditional demand management strategies, this research project seeks to leverage the real-time state of the network to dynamically shape demand, incorporating evolving vehicle and rider trajectories to reflect existing and potential pooling opportunities. These methods have wide-ranging applications for various stakeholders. The methods developed in this project look to help fleet operators create dynamic fare-setting algorithms and technologies that effectively scale ride-pooling operations, and inform local transportation authorities to design dynamic subsidy programs that encourage pooling and alleviate congestion. Beyond passenger transportation and if successful, findings could also be applied to freight bundling and last-mile delivery consolidation, reducing logistics costs and carbon emissions. Additionally, this project will create an educational game focused on shared ride matching and pricing to inspire future generations to address sustainability challenges associated with modern transportation systems.<br/><br/>This research project looks to develop novel models and scalable algorithms for stochastic dynamic decision-making in large-scale transportation networks, with a focus on realistic urban-scale settings comprising tens of thousands of nodes and edges that closely reflect the street grids of major metropolitan areas.

To tackle the curse of dimensionality issue inherent in city-scale Markov decision processes, the project seeks to develop customized approximation algorithms to enhance scalability.

In particular, imaging data of the coronal emission lines of Fe X, Fe XI, Fe XIV, and Ca XV will be used to infer Te via a Radiative Differential Emission Measure (RDEM) analysis. Each emission line requires a narrowband continuum observation, which is used to subtract the background from each line, and will be used to separate electron and dust scattering (K and F corona). The broadband white-light data will then be analyzed using a Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) to infer the projected magnetic field vectors throughout the corona.

This project will allow us to  better understand the coronal/heliosphere system and how it connects with the solar flux evolution. We will study how magnetic field lines are connected, the sources from which the solar wind (flow of particles that streams from the Sun into the heliosphere) emerges, and how the system is restructured through the evolution of the solar surface flux. We will study how the coupling between corona and heliosphere depends on the solar cycle.

Thus far, we have represented them mostly as steady-state magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions. However, a new paradigm is emerging, as time-dependent coronal models are becoming increasingly available. It is now imperative to consider whether the continuous magnetic flux evolution at the solar surface fundamentally changes the picture. In particular, the following questions remain unanswered: (1) Does the nature of open flux change between the two paradigms? (2) What is the origin of large-scale switchbacks and are they related to small-scale phenomena observed by PSP? (3) Are in situ measurements determined more by rotating through a structured heliosphere or by inherent variability along a given flux tube? (4) What are the implications for our current state-of-the-art empirical operational models of the inner heliosphere? These questions will be addressed by comparing ballistic mapping and steady-state models with a time-dependent coronal/heliospheric calculation. We will compute magnetic field mappings in both paradigms and quantify the statistical level of fluctuations.

This technology addresses this issue by integrating advanced water purification technologies into a compact and energy-efficient system. The system combines solar-powered desalination, energy recovery, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven optimization to ensure sustainable and cost-effective operation.  The goal is to provide this technology for use in disaster relief, rural communities, industrial applications, and outdoor recreation.  This system is designed to provide the delivery of clean, safe drinking water where traditional infrastructure is unavailable or insufficient.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a water treatment system for the delivery of clean, safe drinking water where traditional infrastructure is unavailable or insufficient. Conventional desalination systems are often energy-intensive and infrastructure-dependent.  This portable technology integrates a brushless direct current (DC) water pump with sensors for real-time total dissolved solids monitoring, an energy recovery turbine, and ultraviolet (UV)-based disinfection. The system employs artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to optimize performance by adapting to varying water quality conditions while minimizing energy consumption.  In addition, the system is powered by integrated solar panels, which operate independently of traditional infrastructure.  This portable water treatment technology may address the need for water in emergency disaster situations as well as industrial and other applications that require clean water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the first year of life, infants readily pick up the speech sounds of their native language. However, learning new speech sounds is much more difficult in adulthood even after long-term training with explicit instruction and performance feedback. Recent studies have shown that adults can learn new sound categories implicitly?without consciously trying or realizing it?by relying on the brain?s reward system. This project focuses on how to better leverage this implicit learning system to enhance adults? ability to learn new sounds and how this process is implemented in the brain. This work may inform classroom-based language instruction and improve language learning methods for adults, while also providing broader insights into understanding brain plasticity in adulthood. In addition to the scientific work, the project also includes student training and outreach in local schools, language classes, and science centers. These efforts give students hands-on experience in communicating science to the community.<br/><br/>In detail, this project tests the hypothesis that the rhythmic presentation of new sound categories enhances learning by engaging the implicit, reward-based cortico-striatal learning system. Specifically, this project tests whether rhythmic presentations generate temporal predictions and trigger reward signals, which play a key role in inducing brain plasticity for learning across the brain regions connected within the implicit learning circuit. The project uses a combination of well-controlled behavioral tasks, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and noninvasive brain stimulation to obtain converging evidence across several experiments that test the role of rhythmic presentation in enhancing sound category learning. By investigating learning of both speech and non-speech sounds, the overall goal is to develop a neurobiological model of implicit learning for sound categories and better understand how to promote neuroplasticity in the mature brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies of the region of space surrounding Earth often focus on phenomena that are either very large (several times the Earth's diameter or larger) or very small (down to kilometers or meters) phenomena. However, what is still unknown is how the small phenomena affect things on a larger scale.  This study addresses this challenge by studying small (meters in size) structures known as ""Time Domain Structures"" (TDS), which are thought to be associated with plasma waves and strong electric currents in space.  The main objective is to map out where TDS is likely to occur in near-Earth space and under what conditions, allowing us to understand their relation to larger phenomena in space.  This work gives us a better understanding of space weather, which can lead to disruption of radio and cellular communications, GPS navigation, satellites, and the electric power grid.  The PI will develop a cross-disciplinary, research-focused intermediate-level undergraduate course on the space environment.  A public outreach project will convert the solar and space data into sounds to be shown in a local planetarium, an opportunity to attract more participation in space physics.  <br/><br/>The project aims to determine the distribution of time domain structures (TDS) in the magnetosphere as a function of solar wind and geomagnetic conditions, magnetospheric current systems and boundaries, as well as their characteristic changes associated with local mesoscale conditions.  The three scientific objectives are: 1) Determine how the distribution of time domain structures in the magnetosphere changes with changing solar wind and geomagnetic conditions.  2) Determine how the distribution of time domain structures compares with magnetospheric current systems and boundaries.  3) Determine how the characteristics of time domain structures change by region and how the local mesoscale conditions change the behavior.  The team will address these by generating statistical maps of SWD measurements and comparing them with maps of other plasma parameters.  These maps will be binned by solar wind conditions and geophysical activity indices.  Additionally, detailed studies of events observed in different regions of the Earth's magnetosphere will be performed to determine the mesoscale context for the SWD observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to supporting the development of a trustworthy and effective carbon removal industry, this project will help protect marine ecosystems, and strengthen coastal economies, contributing to long-term societal and environmental well-being.<br/><br/><br/>This project proposes the development of an advanced ocean modeling platform that integrates Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-optimized modeling software with artificial intelligence (AI) tools to automate the configuration, validation, and analysis of regional ocean models for marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR). The core innovation lies in leveraging Oceananigans, a cutting-edge ocean simulation framework, and integrating it with AI-driven automation to streamline traditionally complex modeling workflows. This approach aims to make high-resolution, scientifically rigorous ocean modeling easy to use by non-expert users. Key research objectives include automating the retrieval and processing of ocean data, developing tools for automated model validation, and testing the feasibility of real-time adaptive domain boundaries to enhance computational efficiency. The project will also explore using large language models (LLMs) to simplify model setup and gradient-based methods for optimizing mCDR project parameters and uncertainty quantification.

One of the most extreme forms of selfishness is cannibalism, where individuals consume members of their own species. While it seems highly beneficial, cannibalistic behavior varies within and across species. This project investigates this conundrum to reveal what factors restrict cannibalism and how it co-evolves with other social behaviors. Scientists predict that behaviors like kin recognition and movement patterns may evolve alongside cannibalism to reduce its negative effects. This study will test this idea using flour beetles, a well-established model organism in evolutionary biology. Researchers will first study natural beetle populations to measure differences in cannibalism. Then, they will conduct experiments in controlled environments to see how cannibalism, kin recognition, and movement behaviors evolve under different conditions, such as limited food availability and restricted movement. The results will provide new insights into how social behaviors evolve and why individuals within a species differ in their level of selfishness. This project is committed to expanding opportunities for students to engage in scientific research. Undergraduate students will take part in hands-on research experiences, developing essential skills for careers in science. Additionally, the project will create educational resources for K-12 teachers, enabling students to explore evolution and behavior through interactive experiments with flour beetles. These efforts will help introduce a wide range of students to scientific inquiry, spark interest in research, and encourage future careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project investigates how selfish behaviors, such as cannibalism, evolve alongside kin discrimination and dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that these traits should co-evolve to mitigate the costs of extreme selfishness, yet empirical tests are limited. This study will use Tribolium confusum, a widely distributed pest species where cannibalism strongly limits population size, to combine field surveys and experimental evolution in testing key predictions about the evolution of social behaviors. First, researchers will quantify natural variation in cannibalistic behavior within and among populations to identify the extend of natural behavioral diversity. Next, controlled experiments will manipulate dispersal constraints and genotype diversity to test how limited movement affects the co-evolution of cannibalism and kin discrimination. A second experiment will manipulate food availability to examine how environmental stress influences the evolution of selfishness and its interaction with kin recognition and dispersal. By initiating experiments with beetle populations that vary in their natural levels of cannibalism, this study will reveal the range of evolutionary trajectories that can emerge under different ecological conditions. This research will address major gaps in understanding how selfishness and cooperation evolve by providing a direct empirical test of theoretical models. Because the study examines fundamental evolutionary principles, its findings will be broadly relevant to other species, including those in agriculture and pest management. The results will contribute to longstanding debates in behavioral biology and significantly advance our knowledge of how complex social behaviors evolve across different environmental contexts.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative and Organismal Systems and the Evolutionary Processes Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research examines whether or not longer waits result in adverse  health outcomes and higher health spending. The research framework will also help us understand whether and how specific interventions (by hospital systems, health insurers, or governments) can minimize harm to patients.  The researchers measure waiting times for more than a dozen distinct medical procedures including cataract surgeries, hip and knee replacements, and cardiac bypass surgeries. They find evidence that patients who face longer wait times experience worse outcomes, as measured by higher rates of returning to the hospital for follow-up care, higher total medical spending in hospitals, and greater use of opioid prescriptions for pain. The results of their data analysis are used to understand the interaction between health care markets and health insurance markets. Broader impacts of this research include helping individuals, businesses, and governments understand these linked markets.<br/><br/>The researchers advance our understanding by methodological innovation in data construction and research design. They build a new measure of waiting times using insurance claims data. The researchers apply machine learning tools to detect the likelihood of surgical care based on patients? diagnoses, on the tests and imaging procedures they undergo, and on prescription drugs they fill. The rich data also allow the researchers to engage with the endogenous nature of wait times. Specifically, they exploit variation in demand for surgeries and surgeons over time within an insurance network. Network congestion serves as an instrumental variable that shifts waiting times, allowing the research team to identify the causal effect of wait times on health and spending outcomes. Importantly, the causal effects appear heterogeneous across patient types, pointing to potential misallocation in surgical wait times: patients who experience the worst treatment effects from waiting do not necessarily experience the shortest waits. The researchers then combine claims data with a structural economic model governing how households choose insurance plans and how patients choose providers given an insurance network. The model estimates can be used simulate the effects of changes in the regulatory or business environment, such as changes to a state?s network adequacy laws. In the researchers? framework, multiple players in the market can react strategically to a change in the law: patients might re-match to new providers under such a policy, and payers might adjust their insurance premiums to cover added costs from maintaining a larger network. The researchers can thus quantify changes to patient outcomes in a way that accounts for the supply responses of players in the marketplace.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students can better apply calculus concepts in other STEM settings when equipped with a clear geometric intuition for these concepts (i.e., the ability to clearly visualize the mechanisms and interrelationships involved). This project plans to support faculty who wish to incorporate visualization and 3D models in the classroom through mentored partnerships with faculty teams who are committed to making department level change to multivariable calculus instruction. This project also seeks to expand the capabilities of the CalcPlot3D visualization app to support the visualization of additional topics from vector calculus, multiple integration, and physics. This project at Monroe Community College (Lead) involves collaboration with North Carolina State University and the University of Oklahoma along with several partnering institutions. The partnering institutions include the United States Airforce Academy as lead partner as well as the University of Virginia, Colorado School of Mines, Red Rocks Community College, and Northwestern Michigan College. This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EDU) collaborative project responds to the NSF Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Improving Undergraduate STEM Education ? Adaptation, Implementation, and Dissemination (IUSE-AID-DCL 24-026). Related to this DCL, the project aims to reach a broad group of faculty members outside of the collaborating and partnering institutions through multifaceted dissemination, sharing instructional materials and findings. The project also seeks to foster an educational research component which could provide insight into how instructors leverage 3D models and a digital platform for 3D visualization to enhance multivariable calculus instruction. In the process, project researchers plan to study the inter- and intra-institutional collaborations to investigate how postsecondary instructors work with and are influenced by other instructors and, in turn, how this impacts the dissemination of educational efforts.    <br/><br/>The main purposes of this project are (i) to foster institutional implementation of computer visualization and 3D models in multivariable calculus classrooms, helping students develop deeper conceptual understanding, and (ii) to improve the CalcPlot3D visualization tool and produce accompanying learning resources.  The project has five major goals. First, the investigators seek to work with the partnering institutions to adopt instructional changes at a departmental level to incorporate visualization with CalcPlot3D and activities from this project using 3D models. In the process, the project team will provide mentoring and equipment to facilitate this implementation. Second, the project team aims to expand the features of CalcPlot3D to include more built-in options to better support advanced topics in vector calculus, multiple integration, and physics applications. Likewise, this team plans to improve the user interface to make it clearer, more attractive, and easier to use. Third, the team seeks to develop and class-test a series of classroom learning activities using a combination of explorations using CalcPlot3D and 3D-printed models. Fourth, the project's investigators intend to conduct and publish educational research on the effectiveness of project learning activities, on the adoption of 3D models and CalcPlot3D by institutional cohorts, and on instructional implementation of particular topics. Project research will include surveys, interviews, and reviews of instructional materials to determine the diffusion of educational innovation at the institutions of the faculty teams. Outcomes are to be based on the instructors' perceptions of the educational resources as well as the institutions' ability to coalesce as a community of practice. The research studies examine resource adoption by considering differences in initial intentions for and actual adoption at individual institutions, differences in adoption by individuals based on their perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of the resources, mechanisms used by the different institutions to encourage adoption, and roles that mentors play in adoption. The determination of best practices will converge through a multi-year, mixed methods research investigation, employing formative and summative feedback and utilizing the development and testing of classroom activities and materials and faculty professional development resources. This dual investigative approach includes correlation analysis of participant activity and performance data and a study of how classroom instructors reflect on and employ use of the 3D-printed models and learning activities based on those models. For a fifth goal, project findings, outcomes, and resources will be disseminated to facilitate the use and adoption of project materials to the broader community of multivariable calculus instructors. Ultimately, the project investigators aim to share a free visualization tool and learning resources for teaching 3D problems and concepts that can extend to other STEM disciplines and courses beyond calculus.

Cell-free approaches can remove the background processes in cells that complicate chemical reactions. However, this comes at the cost of losing the advantages of biology at the same time, such as the different compartments within cells that make these reactions possible. This approach uses custom-designed enzymes and innovative materials that help organize chemical reactions without needing a cell, making the process easier to scale and more cost-effective. This could open the door to producing high-value products that support and enhance supply chain resilience, while training the next generation of biomanufacturing talent. By advancing this technology, the work supports a stronger U.S. bioeconomy and helps build a skilled workforce for the growing biomanufacturing industry.<br/><br/>Cell-free enzymatic cascades present a powerful opportunity to operate biomanufacturing systems beyond the constraints of living organisms. However, removing cells also eliminates the natural spatial organization biology uses to separate competing pathways. In conventional one-pot systems, maintaining distinct local redox environments is not feasible, which restricts the simultaneous execution of multiple, directionally opposed redox reactions required to produce chiral chemicals. To address this limitation, this project introduces membrane-less coacervate droplets that encapsulate enzymes and artificial redox cofactors within spatially organized compartments. These coacervates and artificial cofactors are composed of low-cost, stable materials using simple, scalable chemistries. This design enables efficient cofactor recycling and enables precise, low-cost delivery of reducing and oxidizing power?all within a single reaction vessel. The result is a robust, reusable platform capable of sustaining multi-enzyme cascades for efficient synthesis. The project will focus on proving the technology through synthesis of high-value, enantio-enriched products such as chiral amines and alcohols?essential building blocks in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Cell-free biomanufacturing addresses key inefficiencies of traditional synthesis of chiral chemicals, such as high production costs and difficulties in chiral separation, potentially opening a new avenue to produce these molecules. Complementing the experimental efforts, data-driven spatiotemporal modeling will generate predictive design rules and enable automated system optimization. The platform will deliver translatable, modular, and rapidly reconfigurable technology designed for broad applicability across diverse chemical targets. This academic?industry collaboration will accelerate innovation, reduce technical risk, and support workforce development in biochemical engineering and computational biosystems?laying the foundation for widespread adoption and future advances in cell-free biosynthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression and many other vital cellular processes. Understanding how RNAs bind and fold is key to uncovering their molecular mechanisms and advancing RNA-based molecular design. Traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which do not account for electronic polarization, often fail to accurately model highly charged RNAs. In particulalr, water molecules, being highly polarizable, behave differently near these charged RNAs compared to in bulk water. In addition, explicit sovent based MD simulations are computationally expensive. To address these chanllenge, Huang and Ren will develop a new polarizable solvation model that represents water molecules around RNAs implicitly through statistical descriptions of water density and correlations. This model will adapt to changes in the local electrostatic environment, ensuring high efficiency and accuracy in modeling RNAs. Huang and Ren will apply this model to study RNA hybridization, RNA-small molecule binding, and ion-induced RNA folding. As part of the educational and component of this project, they will integrate their research findings into undergraduate and graduate courses to enhance STEM education. The developed software will be publicly available through the TINKER software package on GitHub and training workshops will be organized to educate the scientific community on the efficient use of the software.<br/><br/>Compared to the explicit solvent models, the 3-Dimensional Reference Interaction Site Model (3DRISM) simplifies the all-atom description of solvation into a density-based representation of the solvent surrounding the solute. 3DRISM eliminates the need to sample explicit solvent configurations and enables the explicit inclusion of ions (e.g., Mg²?), which are crucial for accurate RNA modeling. However, current 3DRISM solvent models rely on pair correlation functions and cannot explicitly account for the many-body response in solvent. To overcome these limitations, Huang and Ren will develop a polarizable-3DRISM (p3DRISM) implicit solvent model to accurately model polarizable solvation for polarizable AMOEBA solutes. First, Huang and Ren will derive a new form of the 3DRISM equation that incorporates solute-solvent-solvent 3-body correlations and will develop an efficient implementation of this new equation, based on linear response theory. This approach accounts for changes in solvent-solvent correlation functions induced by polarization from the local electric field. Secondly, they will incorporate polarizable solute-solvent interactions through induced dipoles in the p3DRISM scheme. Huang and Ren will apply AMOEBA-p3DRISM to calculate free energies for RNA hybridization and RNA-small molecule binding, as well as to model Mg²?-induced folding of RNA k-turns.

Traditional inspection methods frequently fail to identify small or subtle defects in medical devices, resulting in increased costs from product returns, repairs, and operational inefficiencies. This technology uses a more accurate and efficient defect detection system that is designed to minimize waste, lower rework costs, and optimize production processes. Ultimately, the goal is to improve reliability of medical devices, which may directly enhance patient safety, reduce the risk of recalls, and support better healthcare outcomes. In addition, this technology may decrease production costs, increase competitiveness, and help to ensure compliance with industry standards.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experimental learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a technology to identify, localize, and categorize visual anomalies in the medical manufacturing process. This technology is based on deep-learning and machine vision techniques using a semi-supervised, multi-scale, hierarchical convolutional neural network paired with traditional computer vision engineering to produce a low-latency, highly accurate machine vision system capable of anomaly detection. The system relies on an orchestrated set of vision and image morphology passes to construct a consistent, highly accurate classification and identification mask. The primary goal is to make a substantive improvement to visual anomaly detection for highly consistent objects without requiring an overly large dataset. Adoption of this technology may allow for improved defect detection in the manufacture of critical medical devices in a more streamlined fashion than is possible with human operators alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on developing new ways to forecast Arctic sea ice during summer when sea ice is melting and reaches its minimum, looking at time periods from a few weeks to an entire season. It also aims to determine how far into the future these predictions can be made. The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic is influenced by many factors, ranging from daily weather changes to long-term shifts in global wind patterns, affected by slowly changing ocean temperatures around the world. However, the understanding of how these factors interact is still limited. This limitation comes from the short duration of reliable satellite data monitoring and the complexity of the connections between these elements, which are challenging for traditional climate models or simple statistics to interpret. This project will use advanced and sophisticated machine learning methods to potentially improve predictions of Arctic summer sea ice. Additionally, the project will provide college students with opportunities to learn across different science topics, leveraging the resources and expertise of the participating institutions.<br/> <br/>Preconditioning of sea ice before the summer months has long been recognized as a vital predictor of September's Arctic sea ice extent. The dynamic interactions between ice, ocean, and atmosphere are also major contributors to the changes observed in summer sea ice. The researchers will examine the impacts from external climate components and how they interact with the persistent local conditions before the summer season, which has not been fully considered in previous studies. This project will develop models of regional Arctic sea ice coverage based on a diverse array of observational data at a global scale, integrated by an advanced machine learning method. This approach aims to capture the complex, non-linear variations in both local and remote influences across timescales in a global context. The investigators will conduct a series of meticulously designed reforecast experiments to isolate and quantify the influence of various physical drivers on summertime Arctic ice within the predictive framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contamination of the nation's waterways with emerging contaminants represents a pressing public health concern. Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are known to taint drinking water supplies for a third of U.S. citizens. These pollutants can cause negative health effects at trace concentrations. Consumers' doubts about the quality of their potable water may lead them to use expensive bottled water or point-of-use filtration devices to protect their families. Similarly, commercial/municipal entities continue the search for effective technologies and the magnitude of contaminants renders existing technologies unsuitable for addressing the issue at scale. This project aims to validate beachhead markets for a point-of-use solution to address this challenging problem at relevant scales. The innovative core technology uses renewable wood pulp as an adsorbent scaffold, enabling all Americans access to clean and healthy drinking water.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on an adsorbent technology that addresses growing concerns about water quality. The solution leverages a commonly available and environmentally benign raw material from the wood and paper industries ? wood pulp. The simple one-pot synthetic route to functionalize wood pulp with cationic functional groups has yielded a material that was validated as an excellent adsorbent for commonly encountered perfluorinated alkyl substances. The material demonstrated an over 80% removal within seconds at environmentally relevant conditions, rivaling or exceeding adsorption efficiencies of existing technologies. With annual production wood pulp volumes measured in megatons, these materials are inexpensive and renewable on a human timescale and thus present an ideal opportunity for a water filtration solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Infants tend to look at things people talk about, therefore their eye movements make it possible for researchers to know when speech is interpretable to infants and when it is not. In the second study, investigators create and annotate a large corpus of everyday spoken language. Researchers then use state-of-the-art speech recognition technology to estimate what children learn from the speech they hear at different ages.

Undergraduate students are increasingly asked to make connections and articulate problems from disciplines outside of mathematics in quantitative terms. College faculty also need to understand and meet the changing educational needs of students, and most institutions have limited resources to address this critical challenge. The National Consortium for Synergistic Undergraduate Mathematics via Multi-institutional Interdisciplinary Teaching Partnerships (SUMMIT-P) has been working since 2016 to address these issues by forming and strengthening faculty partnerships across disciplines and institutions. These partnerships have reduced the separation between disciplines, resulting in undergraduate courses that make explicit connections between mathematics and numerous other disciplines. This Level 2 IUSE Institutional and Community Transformation project, led by West Virginia University, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Western Michigan University, includes approximately 40 new institutions that will adapt the SUMMIT-P model to form local faculty teams. The SUMMIT-P team plans to study the experiences of students in these revised courses while also collaborating with national professional societies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the consortium?s work, significantly expanding the scope and positive impact of SUMMIT-P to thousands of additional college students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to assist institutions with the adaptation of a known model for developing and implementing cross-disciplinary STEM courses. The project will also work to broadly disseminate the SUMMIT-P model to institutions beyond the intended 40 project participants. The project will support the development of sustainable collaborations that aim to minimize traditional disciplinary silos. Additionally, the proposed work will advance understanding of the student experience in these interdisciplinary courses, using previous student outcomes in SUMMIT-P courses combined with new data focused on long-term student impact. The project?s research plan is designed to advance understanding of how choices made by institution-based teams affect positive impact of the change process, as well as the institutional qualities and resources that are critical to lasting change. Additionally, the research team plans to study the effectiveness of faculty partnerships formed using SUMMIT-P change processes in creating significant and lasting curricular change that results in positive long-term student impact.

At these phase boundaries, external stimuli, such as electric fields, can trigger interconversion between different structures, leading to colossal physical responses that can be utilized for various functional applications. However, these chemically induced phase boundaries usually involve complex chemical compositions that introduce disorder and heterogeneity. Additionally, these materials often contain toxic lead, raising significant environmental and health concerns. To address these challenges, the research team aims to develop strain-engineering pathways to create phase boundaries in lead-free ferroelectric oxide heterostructures and membranes beyond the traditional chemical method. These new strain modalities open opportunities to explore, manipulate, and harness novel functionalities in oxide materials for next-generation applications. Aligned with the research, this program supports the launch of a teacher-training workshop for the special education teachers in K-12 public schools and offers research internships for high school students. These efforts aim to break barriers to STEM careers for students to promote a stronger workforce. Additionally, this program develops hands-on and online course modules to foster greater interest and access in functional thin-film materials research for undergraduates and graduate students.   <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This program aims to advance strain engineering beyond traditional heteroepitaxy to create strain-induced phase boundaries in lead-free ferroelectric thin-film heterostructures and membranes. By leveraging anisotropic epitaxy and dynamic strain tuning, the program seeks to generate coexisting and bridging phases with enhanced dielectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties in lead-free sodium niobate heterostructures and membranes. This program employs atomic-scale epitaxy and chemical lift-off techniques to synthesize epitaxial heterostructures and membranes while applying mechanical tuning to control the competition between nearly degenerate polymorphs near phase boundaries. A broad set of structural and property characterization tools are utilized to establish strain-structure-property relationships, enabling the rational design and precise control of strain to unlock new phases with superior electrical and electromechanical performance. In parallel, the program integrates educational initiatives to foster a stronger STEM workforce, with a particular focus on engaging students. These initiatives include teacher-training workshops for K-12 special education teachers, research internships for high school students and undergraduate students, as well as hands-on and online course modules focused on functional thin-film materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their technological impact in robotics and autonomous vehicles, these investigations can be extended to human mental health dysfunctions that are often accompanied by deficits in spatial processing such as in early onset Alzheimer?s disease, attentional deficit hyperactivity disorders, schizophrenia, or depression.<br/><br/>This investigation is novel and unique in trying to understand how the interactions between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, two main components of the brain?s ?GPS? system, facilitate navigation, learning, and complex decision making in very large spaces. The research involves using experimental data to constrain a detailed biophysical neural model and testing experimentally its predictions about the properties of neural representations of megaspaces in challenging navigational tasks.  The model will provide a new tool for the detailed study of the use of fixed landmark and moving obstacles in very large environments for efficient navigation. The work will contribute to robotics and computational neuroscience along two different axes: (1) using data-constrained modeling to propose concrete mechanisms explaining the nature of the interactions between self-motion and landmark-based navigational information and (2) using neural representations of large space to achieve efficient solutions or approximations for generally hard spatial navigational problems that could have significant impact in many disciplines.<br/><br/>A companion project is being funded by the Department of Science and Technology, India.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is essential in many contexts, including scheduling work shifts, providing aid during disasters, assigning courses to students, matching research papers with reviewers, and many other scenarios requiring distribution of goods, resources, or services. A key example is optimizing worker shift assignments to maximize efficiency while ensuring a balanced distribution of workloads among staff. Another example is coordinating the distribution of supplies and volunteers during disaster relief efforts to ensure that aid reaches those in need as quickly and effectively as possible. By improving resource allocation strategies, the project aims to enhance operational efficiency while achieving balanced distributions of resources to meet the needs of individuals and organizations across various fields. To achieve this, the project tackles three core challenges: (1) Effective Preference Elicitation ? In many domains, users have complex preferences. For instance, a worker might be able to take either shift A or B but not both. This research direction focuses on developing methods to gather agent preferences effectively while minimizing cognitive burden. (2) Preference Uncertainty ? Users may be uncertain about their preferences. For example, when assigning students to courses, match quality is inherently uncertain. The goal of this project is to develop allocation mechanisms that account for such inaccuracies in agent preferences. (3) Efficient Computation ? Scaling algorithms to handle large problem instances is critical. For example, scheduling shifts in large organizations may involve hundreds of workers and thousands of shift slots. The project aims to design computational frameworks that produce balanced and efficient outcomes in such scenarios. The project will yield practical software tools that enhance AI-driven resource allocation. The educational activities will contribute to curriculum development on collective decision-making and further equip graduate students with essential academic skills, including public speaking, research methodologies, and scholarly writing. <br/><br/>By integrating techniques from machine learning and optimization, this research takes a comprehensive approach to resource allocation. It examines the full process from preference elicitation to algorithmic implementation and output guarantees. Specifically, the project will: (a) investigate methods for eliciting expressive yet tractable agent preferences; (b) explore automated prompting techniques to incentivize more complete preference reporting; (c) model preference uncertainty using learning-theoretic and statistical approaches; (d) develop simple, interpretable algorithms adaptable to various problem domains; and (e) ensure that final allocations are balanced, efficient, and robust. Through this interdisciplinary effort, the project seeks to advance the theoretical foundations and practical applications of balanced and efficient resource allocation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thermogels are solutions at room temperature that become hydrogels at body temperature. This temperature triggered gelation is advantageous in biomedical applications since the hydrogel can be introduced in the human body by simple injection without the need for surgery. However, currently available thermogels lack design flexibility that enables the control over hydrogel properties, such as stiffness, degradability and biofunctionality. This challenge with current thermogels stems from the formation of poorly-defined network structures after injection. To overcome this problem, this project explores a novel thermogel design using polymeric nanoparticles that form ?sticky? patches on their outside surface due to the change in temperature from room temperature to body temperature, which allows them to stick together to form well-defined hydrogel networks. The developed thermogels are expected to be applied for a wide range of human healthcare applications such as localized drug delivery, soft tissue fillers, chronic wound dressings and tissue engineering scaffolds to repair damaged tissue. The project also integrates educational activities with the research efforts by offering hands-on experience and research opportunities to first and second year undergraduate students in order to close the gap between science/engineering education and interdisciplinary biomaterials research and train the next generation of researchers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Despite the unique gelling behavior of thermogels, in which body heat is used to induce a sol-gel transition, the limited control over hydrogel properties such as mechanical properties, degradability and biological functionality remains a challenge, hampering their medical applications. This project aims to establish a modular design approach for thermogels that show controllable gelation/dissolution behaviors and biological functionalities. The central hypothesis is that fine-tuning of material properties can be achieved by developing polymeric micelles with well-defined multiple binding domains (patchy domains) that can modulate intermicellar interactions in response to temperature and biological stimuli as well as provide binding sites for bioactive motifs. This hypothesis has been formulated based on the PI?s recent reports on polymeric micelles with a shell containing phase-separated thermosensitive domains, which served as ?patches? to induce percolated 3D network formation resulting in gelation at 37oC. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the developed technology will provide a new material design for functional in-situ gelling systems that will be broadly applicable in biomedical technologies, such as controlled drug delivery systems and scaffolds for tissue engineering. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three aims: 1) Establish design criteria for polymeric micelles with thermosensitive patchy domains that assemble into hydrogels with controlled mechanical properties, 2) Control dissolution of patchy micelle-based thermogels by biologically relevant stimuli, and 3) Develop a facile approach to introduce bioactive motifs in the patchy micelle-based thermogels. Upon the completion of the proposed research, we will have successfully established a novel avenue to design thermogelling systems with fine-tuned material properties, which meet the requirement for clinical translations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the ways to satisfy this demand is by expanding the available spectrum for cellular operators. However, using new spectrum introduces the risk of interference with legacy services and systems, i.e., systems that are already operating in the targeted frequency bands. Assessing and mitigating such interference is essential in determining whether ? and if so, which - new parts of the spectrum can be made available for enhancing cellular systems and thus improve service to smartphone users. Currently, there is special interest of the cellular industry in the so-called upper midband, a range of frequency bands (i.e., spectrum) that lie between the traditional cellular bands and the millimeter-wave bands already used for 5G cellular. However, this portion of the spectrum is also used by legacy services, including satellite communications. Transmissions of cellular systems operating in the same spectrum in which ground stations communicate to the satellites can lead to significant interference and thus deterioration of quality for those ? very critical ? satellite links. It is important to note that interference to satellite systems is not only caused by direct radiation from terrestrial transmitters, but also by ?upscattering? of terrestrial radiation by buildings, trees, cars, etc., that contributes to the total amount of arriving interference. The primary objectives of this project are to first quantify this upscattering through extensive measurements, and then to use this data to develop new methods for reducing its impacts. Potential mitigation strategies to minimize interference include adjusting the transmission power of cellular transmitters, and by optimizing the transmission direction. The ultimate goal is to find approaches that allow us to use more spectrum ? and thus satisfy the demand of American consumers ? without significantly disrupting existing critical satellite communications. <br/><br/>A key scientific component for reaching this goal is an innovative measurement approach that captures the upscattering effects without needing to send a satellite into space, or gain access to the receiver functionalities of existing satellites. The different capabilities and transmission characteristics of base stations and user equipment of the cellular system are taken into account by two related but distinct measurement setups. Using these setups, the project performs extensive measurements in both urban and suburban environments (which, due to high user density, create the most interference), and create an extensive database as well as a measurement-based interference simulator. The project furthermore explores interference mitigation techniques that employ machine learning to find combinations of beamforming and transmission settings that provide a balance between maintaining reasonable cellular capacity and keeping interference to satellites within specified limits. These techniques account for the fact that the observables, namely the interference level at the satellites, are much less than the number of underlying parameters influencing them, such as user equipment location, power settings, and beamforming approach. The results of this project are of great interest to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), as well as the American cellular and satellite industries, providing valuable insights for spectrum management and interference mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconductor nanocrystals are useful for a wide range of optoelectronics, sensing, and biomedical imaging applications.  The deliberate incorporation of a small amounts of chemical impurities (or dopants) into the semiconductor nanocrystals introduces tunable functionality and novel properties.  This research aims to gain a thorough understanding of the formation mechanism of doped semiconductor clusters and to develop a bottom-up synthetic approach to enable precise control of the dopant level and distribution.  This project will contribute to the preparation of a skilled workforce in STEM fields by training graduate and undergraduate students in chemical synthesis and characterization using sophisticated techniques.  Members of the Kittilstved group supported by this funding will be involved in developing and executing a hands-on lab experience for the Eureka! Program organized by Girls Inc of Holyoke and the College of Natural Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. To facilitate effective collaboration amongst group members, Dr. Kittilstved and his research team will engage with the various research mentoring and professional development workshops available through the Graduate School at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to establish the chemical parameters that promote precise doping of targeted impurity ions within magic-size clusters, which are known to be critical metastable precursors in the synthesis of quantum dots, nanowires, and nanoplatelets.

Over its five-year duration, this Track 2 project will fund scholarships to at least 30 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in atmospheric sciences, biology, chemistry, environmental studies, forensic science, mathematics, and physics/astrophysics. Participating first year students, transfer students, and returning students will receive funding until they complete their degrees for up to five years. Along with financial support, the Question-based Undergraduate Experiential Science Training (QUEST) project aims to provide meaningful educational and research experiences that will prepare scholars for STEM careers. These experiences include a seminar course, professional development sessions, paid individual research with participating faculty, summer internships at UND or partners in external organizations, and summer short courses. QUEST participants will also present their original research at local, regional and national scientific meetings. QUEST has the potential broaden participation in STEM fields in the region through established collaborations with rural high schools and tribal community colleges. The QUEST project will also advance understanding of how diverse mentors and approaches influence the development of science identity and successful outcomes for undergraduate STEM students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The QUEST project has four specific objectives: 1. Recruit and retain talented students that have limited access to STEM training at UND, 2. Generate and knowledge and understand the impact of mentoring relationships on student success, 3. Build connections between UND and other academic programs in the region to promote STEM student success, 4. Share findings and lessons learned locally, regionally and nationally. The QUEST project will examine qualities and aspects of students, mentors and the mentoring relationship relate to the potential for student growth and development. Mentoring relationships are assumed to be constructive and supportive, but that is not always the case. This research will address which aspects of mentoring approaches are associated with student growth and science identity, the effectiveness of coaching techniques for producing positive student outcomes, and how individual mentor characteristics (e.g., self-efficacy and science identify) are associated with successful student growth. Data will be collected from students and faculty through surveys and focus groups at the beginning of the QUEST project. Mentors will be given the opportunity to learn coaching approaches to support STEM student professional development; faculty will be interviewed in focus groups in subsequent years to determine the effect of coaching techniques on student development. These results will be used to bolster social-emotional, cognitive, and identity development for STEM students at UND. QUEST will be evaluated using formative and summative assessments throughout the project using data including the number of students recruited, enrollment, retention and graduation rates, student academic achievement, and feedback from students and faculty. Results from QUEST activities will be made available via local and regional workshops for faculty and academic staff, presentations at local, regional and national meetings and as peer-reviewed publications.

Microencapsulation technology is used for dispersion and controlled-delivery in certain agrochemicals. However, traditional microencapsulation materials in these products made from non-biodegradable polymers can cause microplastic pollution, which has become a critical environmental concern.  The agrochemical sector has an urgent need for new microencapsulation technology with biodegradable materials. This project explores using plant-based materials to replace the plastic-based materials in traditional process, and expands the capability to encapsulate a broader range of agrochemicals with different properties. Compared to other emerging solutions, the proposed technology provides competitive cost and environmentally-friendly procedure. In addition to meeting the regulatory requirement, it can benefit a large potential market by reducing the degradation and runoff of agrochemicals in the field to ensure high efficiency. By using microencapsulation to extend the retention time and enable the slow-release process, the proposed technology can make more effective use of agrochemicals while substantially mitigating their impact.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves creating microencapsulation methods with plant-based biodegradable materials to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic agrochemical ingredients. Conventional technologies for encapsulating oil-based ingredients use interfacial polymerization mechanism. Given that a limited number of chemical reactions can form a polymer layer at water/oil interface, the resulting shell materials are prevalently non-biodegradable polymers. The proposed technology is based on a new mechanism with an amphiphilic polymer crosslinked in situ to form the shell. The materials are derived from natural materials such as polysaccharides and fatty acids that have intrinsic biodegradability. To encapsulate hydrophilic compounds, this project will explore bilayer shell structure and coacervation methods. The encapsulation will be based on the factors of electrical charge, polarity or steric effect of the molecules. In order to control the release profile, the thickness of the shell will be adjusted by tuning the materials ratio and polymer structure. The stability of the microcapsule materials will be studied to ensure adequate shelf life. This project provides new scientific insights to develop microencapsulation technology with natural materials, with direct impact to address critical challenges for current agrochemical industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical phenomena like light waves exist in analog domain, whereas chip circuits require digital values. ADCs turn real world analog measurements into digital values that are used in computers. This project enhances scientific and technological understanding of the ADC process by demonstrating a new approach based on machine learning (ML). Computer models suggest that this new, patent-pending approach can measure much denser signals than traditional ADCs, meaning more information can be captured and processed. The first market opportunity will be computer chips that send data over networks, enabling faster data center and internet connections. The devices using this technology will have significant higher speeds and have cost advantages over traditional devices. The existing data center ADC market is close to $1 billion annually and growing. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the design of ADCs. The ML ADC decomposes an analog signal into multiple channels, each containing only a portion of the signal?s total information. Each channel is sampled separately, slower than the input signal?s Nyquist rate, producing aliased and complicated digital outputs. A neural network, trained to approximate the inverse transfer function of the analog front-end, maps those digital outputs to the standard Shannon-Nyquist signal representation. This project implements one half of a common communication device, a Serializer/Deserializer receiver, using a ML ADC in printed circuit board prototype form. This project will examine the ability of the physical prototype to capture complete information in gigahertz-range pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) signals. This project expects to replicate computer simulations indicating high accuracy of the ML ADC when driven by a jittery and phase-drifting clock running below the Nyquist rate.

The project will bring potentially transformative changes in real-time DER orchestration as the proposed solutions waive low-observability challenges in distribution grids and unlock the full potential of DERs controlled by machine learning (ML) models. These two goals are achieved by identifying the most critical data streams for orchestrating DERs in real time and by integrating ML models into grid scheduling. Regarding intellectual merits, this project: i) introduces feature selection into grid optimization, ii) leverages contemporary differentiation tools, iii) develops algorithms for grid optimization using generalized load models; and iv) draws parallels between grid optimization and empirical risk minimization. Regarding broader impacts, this project: i) explores converging ideas at the intersection of power systems, optimization, and ML, which could bring potentially significant technological innovation in the power industry ecosystem; ii) advances knowledge in sensitivity analysis, feature selection for optimization and control, and resilience against data attacks to optimization input parameters; and iii) reaches out to undergraduate students through hands-on activities, seminars, and discussions on career opportunities in STEM.<br/><br/>Optimally scheduling distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution grids entails communicating with thousands of customers in near real-time to read load demands and pass them as input data to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. At the same time, DERs increasingly deviate from traditional constant-power models as their injections are specified by data-driven control rules or policies, which often give rise to dynamics by interacting with the power grid. In this context, this project aspires to develop OPF formulations that are data-frugal and seamlessly accommodate grid-adaptive power injection models for DERs. The particular objectives of the projects are to: 1) Reduce data communication for a grid operator to orchestrate DERs, by strategically identifying subsets of customer or grid meters that are most influential in making effective OPF decisions; 2) Use machine learning tools to transform distilled data so that when fed into the OPF, they yield near-optimal near-feasible decisions; 3) Expedite the calculation of sensitivities (partial derivatives) for the inverse power flow (PF) mapping and equilibrium states under DER-induced grid dynamics; and 4) Devise novel algorithms for solving the OPF under generalized power injection models, when convex relaxations are deemed inadequate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, unlocking this potential requires the development of new on-chip radiofrequency (RF) systems allowing wireless transceivers to transmit data at extremely high rates even in highly congested electromagnetic environments. Therefore, new technologies are needed to enhance these wireless transceivers' resilience against electromagnetic interference (EMI). In this context, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to new computational resources that enable the rapid detection and characterization of EMI in wireless systems. These advancements have paved the way for radio receivers (RXs) capable of suppressing EMI by activating tunable and sharp notches within the passband of their embedded bandpass filters. Among the most widely used filters in RF wireless transceivers are Aluminum Nitride (AlN) and Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) bandpass filters. Their popularity stems from their low loss, high out-of-band rejection, and compatibility with manufacturing processes used for integrated circuits in consumer electronics. However, current AlN and AlScN filters cannot activate tunable and sharp notches within their passband without suffering severe performance degradation, strong signal distortion, and a significant reduction in spectral efficiency. Additionally, these filters are unable to achieve fractional bandwidths of 10% or higher, which is a major challenge for their application in future 5G and 6G wireless transceivers. This project will leverage our interdisciplinary expertise in micro- and nanofabrication, spintronics, and microwave acoustics to develop SpinPhonic -- the first AlScN microelectromechanical RF bandpass filter capable of activating widely tunable and sharp notches within its passband for effective EMI suppression. <br/><br/>The new SpinPhonic technology will achieve the widest fractional bandwidth ever reported for AlScN filters by leveraging the unique acoustic properties of phononic crystals (PnCs). Additionally, it will harness novel dynamical interactions between magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom to activate exceptionally sharp notches for EMI suppression. These notches will attenuate EMI by more than 40 dB through magnon-phonon coupling in a ferromagnetic film heterogeneously integrated with the AlScN layer. This attenuation will be highly frequency-selective, minimizing disruptions to other RF communication channels at unaffected frequencies. Furthermore, SpinPhonic's notches will be tunable through changes of an external magnetic field, offering a fractional tuning range of their center frequency exceeding 10% and an average magnetic tuning sensitivity two orders of magnitude higher than that of current state-of-the-art magnetically tunable counterparts. Integrating SpinPhonic into future RXs will enable reduction of bit-error rates by two orders of magnitude in EMI-affected RF wireless transceivers, allowing the use of higher data rates for transmitting larger volumes of information. The project team will collaborate with the STEM education and workforce development program at Northeastern University to organize on-campus education activities involving K-12 students, community colleges, and local schools, with a focus on enhancing STEM engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DON plays important roles in primary production, nutrient availability, and carbon storage in the ocean. The compounds and structures in DON influence its role in these processes. This project uses novel methods to study amino acids, a group of small organic nitrogen compounds that make-up proteins. Specifically, the study will focus on how amino acids are converted to different forms and ?refractory DON.? Refractory DON is important because it can resist degradation and persist in the ocean for several thousand years. This study will use stable isotopes to trace the fate of nitrogen in amino acids and address important questions about marine nitrogen cycling. Findings from this study will be useful for understanding the composition of DON and how marine organisms use this form of nitrogen. In addition, this project will train graduate and undergraduate students, offer education programs to K-12 students, and enhance ocean literacy through public presentations and radio programs.<br/><br/>This project investigates the fate of nitrogen (N) in amino acids and the processes that contribute to forming refractory dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the ocean. Using stable isotope probing with 15N-labeled amino acids and controlled incubations, the study will trace the fate of different amino acids with diverse chemical structures in waters from productive coastal zones to oligotrophic open ocean waters. The proportions of amino acid-derived N that are remineralized into inorganic forms (e.g., ammonium, nitrite and nitrate), converted to labile DON, and transformed to refractory DON, will be traced and quantified. Through the comparison of labeled and unlabeled incubations, advanced high-resolution mass spectrometry techniques will be applied to characterize the molecular composition of amino acid-derived DON and compare it to naturally occurring refractory DON. The overarching goal of the project is to improve the understanding of N cycling and the processes that influence the marine DON pool. Results from this project will enhance our understanding of marine N dynamics and the molecular-level composition of the oceanic DON pool.

Undergraduate students are increasingly asked to make connections and articulate problems from disciplines outside of mathematics in quantitative terms. College faculty also need to understand and meet the changing educational needs of students, and most institutions have limited resources to address this critical challenge. The National Consortium for Synergistic Undergraduate Mathematics via Multi-institutional Interdisciplinary Teaching Partnerships (SUMMIT-P) has been working since 2016 to address these issues by forming and strengthening faculty partnerships across disciplines and institutions. These partnerships have reduced the separation between disciplines, resulting in undergraduate courses that make explicit connections between mathematics and numerous other disciplines. This Level 2 IUSE Institutional and Community Transformation project, led by West Virginia University, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Western Michigan University, includes approximately 40 new institutions that will adapt the SUMMIT-P model to form local faculty teams. The SUMMIT-P team plans to study the experiences of students in these revised courses while also collaborating with national professional societies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the consortium?s work, significantly expanding the scope and positive impact of SUMMIT-P to thousands of additional college students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to assist institutions with the adaptation of a known model for developing and implementing cross-disciplinary STEM courses. The project will also work to broadly disseminate the SUMMIT-P model to institutions beyond the intended 40 project participants. The project will support the development of sustainable collaborations that aim to minimize traditional disciplinary silos. Additionally, the proposed work will advance understanding of the student experience in these interdisciplinary courses, using previous student outcomes in SUMMIT-P courses combined with new data focused on long-term student impact. The project?s research plan is designed to advance understanding of how choices made by institution-based teams affect positive impact of the change process, as well as the institutional qualities and resources that are critical to lasting change. Additionally, the research team plans to study the effectiveness of faculty partnerships formed using SUMMIT-P change processes in creating significant and lasting curricular change that results in positive long-term student impact.

PFAS have wide use in both industrial and consumer products.  However, PFAS are linked to adverse health effects, even at exceptionally low parts per trillion (ppt) levels. Once PFAS enter the environment, these substances do not easily break down, making their removal a significant challenge. The fundamental issue this solution seeks to address is the inadequate effectiveness of existing GAC filtration in removing PFAS from contaminated water, resulting in low treatment performance and increased operational costs for drinking water treatment facilities. At least 45% of U.S. tap water contains PFAS, and nearly all Americans have PFAS in their blood, underscoring the widespread nature of the problem. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential a new technology for removing PFAS from water. This technology is based on a novel hydrophobic ion-pairing (HIP) pretreatment for Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filters that enables the filters to capture short-chain PFAS effectively. The HIP technique involves forming ion pairs between charged hydrophilic molecules and hydrophobic counterions, resulting in neutral hydrophobic complexes. In this pretreatment method, the interaction between charged PFAS and the HIP agent creates a hydrophobic complex, enhancing adsorption onto the GAC without altering the filter material itself or requiring complex modifications. The benefits of this approach include increased removal of short-chain PFAS in compliance with regulatory standards, extended lifespan of GAC filter columns used in water treatment facilities, improved adsorption efficiency, and reduced GAC waste.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional spectrometers, which are used to study light for applications like health monitoring and environmental testing, are often large, expensive, and shock sensitive. These typically rely on special components called surface gratings, which make it difficult to create compact and affordable spectrometers without sacrificing the accuracy. This project introduces a new spectrometer design with smaller size and lower complexity while maintaining high precision. By making light spectral analysis more accessible and portable, this technology could benefit many industries like healthcare and agriculture. This design can ultimately be built directly into semiconductor chips.

This entails enabling on-demand control over internal parameters of r-CBGs, such as refractive index contrast and chirp rate, to achieve target performance specifications, consequently, modifying the holographic recording mechanism to produce r-CBGs with desired specifications. The STTR project will develop a theoretical model to comprehensively study light diffraction within an r-CBG, which will be crucial for optimizing the design of the prototype, including the light coupling mechanism, placement geometry of the r-CBG and the placement of the detector.

Geophysical tools can tell us about today's crustal thickness. However, they cannot determine the crustal thickness in the geologic past or how it has changed over time. Knowing the crustal thickness above ancient subduction zones helps us understand several processes, including the formation of mountains, ore deposits, sediments, and the continental crust, where people live. Researchers commonly use compositional markers of rocks to estimate crustal thickness. However, these compositions may be averages, resulting from many processes that rocks experience during their formation. As a result, there are large uncertainties in determining paleo crustal thickness. The research team will study the melts that formed the final rock composition, using minerals that crystallized early in the magma's history. The calculated melt compositions will be used to test whether the magmas formed in thick or thin crust, and how this changed over space and time. The research team will collect data from four ancient arc segments in the western US and will create field research videos to showcase their findings and raise awareness about geoscience research. Collaboration between institutions will create new pathways in field and laboratory science for 10 students engaged in the research project.<br/><br/>Petrologic proxies of arc crustal thickness are often applied to plutonic datasets in ancient, exhumed arc systems to generate an estimate of paleo-arc thickness. However, studies have recognized that bulk-rock trace element ratios in plutonic rocks are composite signals of pressure-dependent crystallization and subsequent magmatic processing. Crystal accumulation is of particular concern, since bulk-rock trace element ratios in samples with accumulated crystals do not represent melt values and thus may not retain information about the source depths from which melts were derived. The research aims to quantify the extent of this processing and to investigate the underlying petrologic mechanisms that define the composition-crustal thickness relationship, utilizing mineral-melt equilibrium relationships in high-temperature minerals. The research team will use high temperature minerals to 1) identify and quantify crystal accumulation in plutonic samples; 2) reconstruct trace element melt compositions and evaluate the preservation of pressure-dependent signals; 3) assess melt evolution across four arc segments that preserve different instances of arc crustal thickness: across space, through time, and vertically through the crustal column. Investigation of the underlying petrologic processes that define compositional-crustal thickness relationships is critical to our understanding of the effects of melt fractionation and crystal accumulation on trace element signatures in rocks and minerals. Findings will enable testing of existing models, and potentially generate new models, for magma processing and connectivity in the arc crustal column, and contributes to the larger, first-order question of where most magmatic differentiation processes occur in the crust. The research team will create field research videos to showcase their findings and raise awareness about geoscience research.

The principal objective is to enhance scientific understanding of snow and ice particles with applications in improving weather forecasting and precipitation estimation, the importance of which to economy, safety, and everyday life can hardly be overstated. In line with the saying that ?no two snowflakes are alike,? there indeed is a huge natural variability of shapes, sizes, internal compositions, densities, and habits of snow and ice particles, which are both truly fascinating and extremely challenging to observe, measure, analyze, understand, and predict. This project develops and applies a synergistic systematic approach to analysis, characterization, and quantification of a large variety of snowflakes and snowfall advancing and integrating microphysics and computational methodologies, emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning (ML) techniques, sophisticated image and data processing and computer vision methods, and cutting-edge optical and computer technology and equipment. The project performs new comprehensive microphysical analysis, profiling, and parametrization of precipitation particles, whose outcomes will be systematized and organized into the ?Snowflake World Bank? database. Education and outreach plan includes advising/training Ph.D. students, course modules, undergraduate capstone projects, and vertically integrated ?AI and Snowflakes? outreach program. <br/><br/>This research develops new general methods for classification, characterization, and quantification of snowflakes based on multicamera measurements and AI/ML and image-processing techniques. Main outcomes are a novel AI/ML-enabled methodology for automatic classification of precipitation, namely, deciding to which of the predefined classes of winter hydrometeors the observed particles belong, based on multiview images by multicamera instrumentation measurements, as well as a novel method for realistic reconstruction of 3D shapes of winter hydrometeors using full images from multiview cameras and AI/ML. To aid the observations, a novel multicamera instrument for snowflakes in freefall, namely, the Multicamera Snowflake Profiler (MSP), will be developed. The MSP will incorporate and apply novel classification and shape reconstruction methods, on-site, in real time, which will, conversely, be used to advance the methods. The research measures, calculates, and estimates a wide range of properties and parameters of ice particles including geometric categories; degrees of riming; melt/dry state; fall speed; 3D reconstructed shape; volume; mass; effective density; and effective dielectric constant among others. Generally, and not exclusively, it pursues the concept of classification first and then quantification by assigning these properties and parameters to various categories of previously classified particles.

This combination allows for precise control over mechanical properties, including elasticity and compliance, while promoting cell adhesion and integration with native tissue. The research objectives include optimizing a custom bioprinting system for the Darcon blend, fine-tuning material compositions to achieve the desired mechanical properties, and evaluating the grafts for structural integrity and performance. The anticipated results include the successful production of vascular conduits with controlled dimensions, improved mechanical compatibility with native arteries, and enhanced biofunctionality for long-term graft success.

It would also accelerate progress of the quantum technology sector in the U.S. and lay foundations for new capabilities in industry.  However, the components for such a system still need to be developed. This CAREER award supports the PI's research team in building components for a robust quantum network. The research team will use ytterbium (Yb) atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays and nanophotonic cavities to create quantum nodes. Quantum information will then be transmitted between nodes by entangled photons emitted by the atoms and channeled using the nanophotonic cavities. Unique optical transitions in Yb generate photons at telecommunications wavelengths, which will facilitate long-distance quantum communication. The award's educational activities are seamlessly integrated with the PI's research efforts, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of QIS and facilitating the dissemination of this research to the broader community.

The ultra-long coherence nuclear spin qubit in Yb makes it a desirable candidate for the coherent storage of quantum information. A unique set of optical transitions in Yb produces entangled photons in the telecom optical frequency band, which are enhanced and efficiently transported by the nanophotonic cavity. The telecom operation of this quantum network is critical for the long-distance transfer of quantum coherence and integration with existing silicon photonic devices. Furthermore, the proximity of neighboring atoms in an atomic array leads to cooperative effects that can further enhance entangled photon emission into the nanophotonic structure. Understanding these cooperative effects in ordered atom arrays remains an open theoretical problem in quantum optics and is only recently experimentally feasible. The PI's team will investigate these effects using the nanophotonic cavity as a conduit to manipulate and read out the cooperative state of the atom array.

The microbiome of humans and other animals is now considered to be an organ-like system, digesting our food, regulating host behaviors, training the immune system, and producing diverse nutrients, signaling molecules, and/or toxins to effectively compete and survive in their local environment. However, the molecular mechanisms and fundamental chemical understanding of how key members of the microbiome compete for effective colonization remain unknown. Colonization mechanisms underlie whether microbiomes across diverse animals are in balance. The proposed experiments will characterize the structures and functions of nucleotide translational inhibitors produced by microbiome members, how they are produced, and how they regulate community dynamics. These efforts will allow graduate students to acquire training in specialized metabolism in the context of animal-microbe chemical interactions. This research is also integrated with an outreach program ?Microbial Magic: Harnessing the Power of Bacteria? to introduce high school students to the science of the microbiome and microbial metabolism.<br/><br/>The Crawford laboratory discovered a wide family of mis-annotated tRNA synthetases in microbiomes that are dedicated to the synthesis of a new class of specialized nucleotides featuring a remarkable orthoester functionality. These metabolites, which very likely evolved from translational machinery, do not contribute to cellular growth, but rather were found to inhibit translation. While nucleoside natural products are well known, the phosphate group on these functionalized nucleotides prevents passive cellular diffusion. This limitation demands specialized uptake mechanisms in recipient organisms and potentially allows for selective taxonomic targeting across diverse microbiomes. The proposed studies combine chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology interdisciplinary approaches to provide new insights into this family of mis-annotated tRNA synthetases that have remained ?hidden in plain sight? in genome databases until now. Project goals include structural characterization of nucleotides from ?orphan? pathways, biochemical characterization of the enzymes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, and functional characterization of the molecules in in vitro translation inhibition and their regulatory effects on microbiome community structure.

Geophysical tools can tell us about today's crustal thickness. However, they cannot determine the crustal thickness in the geologic past or how it has changed over time. Knowing the crustal thickness above ancient subduction zones helps us understand several processes, including the formation of mountains, ore deposits, sediments, and the continental crust, where people live. Researchers commonly use compositional markers of rocks to estimate crustal thickness. However, these compositions may be averages, resulting from many processes that rocks experience during their formation. As a result, there are large uncertainties in determining paleo crustal thickness. The research team will study the melts that formed the final rock composition, using minerals that crystallized early in the magma's history. The calculated melt compositions will be used to test whether the magmas formed in thick or thin crust, and how this changed over space and time. The research team will collect data from four ancient arc segments in the western US and will create field research videos to showcase their findings and raise awareness about geoscience research. Collaboration between institutions will create new pathways in field and laboratory science for 10 students engaged in the research project.<br/><br/>Petrologic proxies of arc crustal thickness are often applied to plutonic datasets in ancient, exhumed arc systems to generate an estimate of paleo-arc thickness. However, studies have recognized that bulk-rock trace element ratios in plutonic rocks are composite signals of pressure-dependent crystallization and subsequent magmatic processing. Crystal accumulation is of particular concern, since bulk-rock trace element ratios in samples with accumulated crystals do not represent melt values and thus may not retain information about the source depths from which melts were derived. The research aims to quantify the extent of this processing and to investigate the underlying petrologic mechanisms that define the composition-crustal thickness relationship, utilizing mineral-melt equilibrium relationships in high-temperature minerals. The research team will use high temperature minerals to 1) identify and quantify crystal accumulation in plutonic samples; 2) reconstruct trace element melt compositions and evaluate the preservation of pressure-dependent signals; 3) assess melt evolution across four arc segments that preserve different instances of arc crustal thickness: across space, through time, and vertically through the crustal column. Investigation of the underlying petrologic processes that define compositional-crustal thickness relationships is critical to our understanding of the effects of melt fractionation and crystal accumulation on trace element signatures in rocks and minerals. Findings will enable testing of existing models, and potentially generate new models, for magma processing and connectivity in the arc crustal column, and contributes to the larger, first-order question of where most magmatic differentiation processes occur in the crust. The research team will create field research videos to showcase their findings and raise awareness about geoscience research.

Certain sources are non-sustainable, meaning that they cannot be replenished quickly once consumed, while others are sustainable and can be regenerated. Unfortunately, non-sustainable sources are running out rapidly; thus, the nation could benefit both environmentally and economically from an improved use of sustainable sources. Plants are promising sustainable sources, which offer fuels, materials, and nutrients. Yet, these valuable components cannot be easily taken out from plants, because they are trapped in plant skins. Typical plant skins are composed of complex species, such as i) an intense network of numerous, cross-linked large molecules, known as cellulose, ii) a bunch of small molecules known as lipids which line up and assemble into plant cell membranes, and iii) glycoproteins, molecules formed by sugar-like molecules connected with proteins. These species build up a hard protection layer to plants, which cannot be broken down easily. This project will develop special biomaterials to break down such a protection layer. A series of enzymes, special proteins which speed up the breaking-down of cellulose, lipids, and glycoproteins, will be placed in the scaffolds and gaps of a solid crystal, known as Ca-MOM. These enzymes will cooperate to degrade the protection layer of plants without generating adverse by-products. The Ca-MOM crystal will stabilize and help re-collect the enzymes, making them reusable. Meanwhile, the positions of the enzymes in the crystal scaffolds will also be probed to understand the performance of the enzymes in the developed biomaterials. These efforts will not only produce biomaterials to efficiently and sustainably break down plant skins to allow for the extraction of valuable energy resources and materials but also understand how enzymes function in these biomaterials. The demonstrated strategy will also improve the progress of science because it can be adapted to breaking down of other natural sources which contain valuable components and require multiple enzymes to cooperate. The research efforts will be bridged with an educational plan to bring research opportunities to local underrepresented groups by involving them in green chemistry research. This principle investigator will also develop an educational program called Green Chemistry- Green Planet in order to introduce the green chemistry concept to local elementary students through established programs such as the North Dakota (ND) 4-H and Operation Military Kids programs in ND.<br/><br/><br/>Technical summary/abstract<br/><br/>Plants are sustainable sources of energy and materials, yet the valuable components are protected by plant cell walls. The challenges to break down these cell walls are the difficulty in degrading the intense cellulose network, the major cause of cell wall stiffness, and complexities due to other components such as lipids and glycoproteins, which also enhance viscosity and stiffness. Using cellulases and accessory enzymes to degrade cellulose and other components is the green choice of plant biomass degradation due to their specificity and biocompatibility, yet the challenge is the need of multiple enzymes including proteases which damage the partner enzymes. This project will overcome this challenge by immobilizing three celluases, a lipase, and a protease on Metal-Organic Materials (MOM) via enzyme-MOM co-crystallization. In the resultant co-crystals, each enzyme is partially exposed to the reaction medium for substrate contact while partially buried under MOM surfaces for enzyme protection to reduce proteolytic damage. The developed biocatalysts will be demonstrated on the degradation of a model plant biomass, followed by probing the structure-property relationship of the resultant multi-enzyme/MOM biocatalysts differing in MOM ligands using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The hypotheses are 1) simultaneous immobilization of 5 enzymes enhances the cost efficiency of and accelerate plant biomass degradation with reduced proteolytic damage and 2) the biocatalytic performance of the developed biocatalysts depends on the structural basis of enzyme exposure on MOM surfaces and MOM ligands. These hypotheses will be tested through three objectives: 1) develop a 5-in-1/Ca-BDC biocatalyst for the rapid biodegradation of plant biomass, 2) determine the structural basis of the 5-in-1/Ca-BDC biocatalyst, and 3) establish the structure-property relationship of the 5-in-1/Ca-MOMs the biocatalytic performance of the developed biocatalysts. The educational plan of this project will provide opportunities for averagely 1 Native American student, 2 undergraduate students, and 1 local high school student per year to participate in green chemistry research. In addition, an educational program called Green Chemistry - Green Planet will be developed to enhance the science knowledge of numerous K-12 students via the North Dakota (ND) 4-H system and the Operation Military Kids program in ND.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this program is to mentor up to 48 principal investigators (PIs) who are in their 1st or 2nd year of their S-STEM Grant. The mentees will be split up based on institutional type (e.g., private, state, research-heavy, 4-year primarily undergraduate or community college) and region (urban, suburban, rural, EPSCOR, ect.). This will allow the project to achieve two outcomes: First, a wide variety of PIs will be assisted, leading to more successful S-STEM programs in their early years of implementation. Second, surveys will be conducted and focus group data collected to generate broad and widely applicable recommendations for the effective and successful implementation of S-STEM programs.<br/><br/>The S-STEM program offers a wealth of knowledge focused on promoting student success. A mentoring program designed for S-STEM principal investigators (PIs) can similarly yield insights by identifying common institutional barriers and recruitment challenges, enabling the testing and tracking of effective solutions. The findings from this initiative could serve as a valuable resource for all S-STEM PIs and assist institutions in developing strategies to enhance the persistence of low-income students in STEM fields. Additionally, this program will provide direct support to newer PIs by minimizing the time spent navigating institutional obstacles, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of recruitment efforts, and helping the PIs articulate their successes and challenges to the NSF in their annual reports. Comparative surveys will be conducted between mentored PIs and those in their second or third year who did not receive mentoring to evaluate the perceived challenges of managing and implementing an S-STEM project, both with and without peer PI mentoring.

The end goal is a wearable, such as a heart rate monitor for athletes, that would never need a coin cell battery replacement or a recharge. Such a wearable product would enable continuous data acquisition, allowing better monitoring of an athlete?s performance.  This technology would limit the use of coin cell batteries. Once an initial market of wearables for athletes can be commercialized, longer-term wearable applications in telehealth and national defense will open up. Key innovations will enhance scientific and technological understanding in the power management circuitry for a system powered by human movement and in the long-term use vibrations harvesters.

Electromagnetic vibration harvesters are ideal for harvesting low-frequency human movement. Unlike piezoelectric harvesters? high voltage outputs, electromagnetic harvesters? voltage outputs are low and will not create an electrostatic discharge event. This allows the use of low-power innovations in integrated circuit Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Unique circuit designs allowing for low-voltage start-up, a custom electromagnetic vibration harvester, and power-management system are necessary for a prototype system that will need to operate from non-periodic human movement in this project.

Acrylates are expensive components of paints, Plexiglas®, and super-absorbent materials. By using engineered enzymes and innovative, low-cost chemicals, the process will convert affordable plant material into these high-value products instead. The team of experts from academia and industry will test this technology at pilot scales, demonstrating its potential to strengthen the U.S. bioeconomy. The project will also train a new workforce in protein design and synthetic biology.<br/><br/>This project leverages artificial intelligence and advanced protein engineering to develop a scalable, cost-effective, and cell-free biocatalytic process for producing methylene butyrolactone (MBL), a bio-based acrylate monomer. The work begins with mining and redesigning natural enzymes to catalyze the conversion of itaconate to MBL using machine learning-guided frameworks and high-throughput Design-Build-Test-Learn cycles. Enzymes will be further engineered to utilize a non-natural cofactor, which provides enhanced stability, cost efficiency, and suitability for industrial conditions while overcoming traditional biochemical limitations. Subsequent phases involve strain engineering for enzyme production at titers exceeding 1 g/L in E. coli and demonstrating the complete process in 1-5L bioreactors. By coupling enzymes with chemical conversion processes, the project integrates enzyme performance, cofactor recycling, and chemical efficiency to achieve over 90% yield at industrial scales. Beyond enabling cost-competitive MBL production, this project overcomes key limitations of natural cofactor-dependent enzymes, advancing cell-free biocatalysis and its broader applications in synthetic pathways.

Simulation relies on numerical solvers whose continued improvements in terms of speed and accuracy are of pivotal national importance. Unfortunately, the progress of solvers is hampered by two emerging challenges: (1) the problems being modeled and solved, including their data captured through matrices, are becoming numerically harder, causing many solvers to fail; (2) newer arithmetic hardware, increasingly second-purposed from those developed to support artificial intelligence (AI), ends up having suboptimal precision while also deviating from established numerical standards. The project's novelties are: (1) the development of practical formal methods that are capable of capturing the correctness expectations of numerical algorithm designers as formal requirements; (2) the development of formal models capable of modeling non-standard hardware while bridging their behavioral differences to present uniform higher level formal abstractions; and (3) methods to carry out end-to-end correctness verification that help establish that the formal models of the underlying hardware meet the numerical algorithm correctness requirements. The project's contributions will help advance the nation's simulation-based scientific exploration capabilities. It will also help recoup the investments already made in today's numerical solvers, allowing them to be easily and reliably adapted to new problems and hardware. Without these capabilities, scientific computing and data-enabled discoveries can experience multiple productivity gaps, negatively impacting scientific research and engineering advances. The project will also train students to have the debugging skills necessary to solve numerical issues arising in the context of future solver design and deployment.<br/><br/>This project handles data hardness using iterative refinement algorithms that are followed by the linear algebra routines underlying linear solvers. These algorithms can be verifiably guarded by novel formal properties that stem from how the problem eigenvalues appear in the problem?s data matrices. This project's techniques adapt the numerical hardware to pre-existing solvers (and their assumptions) and help develop new solvers that employ mixed numerical precision schemes during iterative refinement. These adaptations will be aided by novel emulation schemes that help match and formally verify numerical precision, rounding rules, and floating-point exception handling rules. The goals of these techniques are to resolve the ""Data/Numerics Tug of War"" so that each solver developer obtains their preferred starting point: from algorithms down to hardware or vice-versa. This project will contribute key scientific principles and algorithms to support future research and development activities in adapting solvers to newer hardware. It will have a broad impact, including (1) sustain established solvers across new generations of hardware and (2) solve numerical issues that arise when solvers and optimizers used in AI are enhanced to handle larger scale and newer problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the proposal is to develop a technology that can distinguish mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Diagnosing AD at the MCI stage and therapeutic intervention at this stage are the keys to developing effective therapeutics, lifestyle changes, and future planning for patients, caregivers, and stakeholders. Clinical diagnosis of AD is miserably low (~60% specificity and sensitivity). Such an image analysis platform will ensure a sophisticated tool for geriatric primary care and neurologists to detect a predementia patient with a certain chance of being converted to AD shortly. In the broader commercial potential, the user-friendly brain imaging data analysis platform will be transferred to the clinic to assist in the early diagnosis of AD, particularly the MCI stage and prognosis, using MRI images.<br/> <br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to utilize 3-dimensional (3D) Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) brain scans from the patients as input to a specialized artificial intelligence (AI) platform that reduces dimensions and extracts latent features evolved from the affected whole brain by the disease. This AI-Machine Learning (ML) measures changes related to the atrophy of the brain, and relative temporal and region-specific changes correlated with the level of the patient's cognitive function. The algorithm classified Alzheimer?s disease (AD) vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with accuracies of 81.41% and autopsy-confirmed AD vs. MCI at 92.75%. Proof-of-concept has been published in a peer-reviewed journal. There is no definitive diagnostic tool for AD that is cost-effective. In the broader commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project, Neurologists/Gerontologists will use it for diagnostic and patient stratification. As the anticipated results, the technology would overlay MRI retrieval and provide an additional interpretive and diagnostic aspect to help neurologists provide a more accurate diagnosis of AD, MCI, other non-AD dementia, and normal brain. The resulting product of this study will address the differential diagnosis of AD, a significant unmet need. The algorithm can be extended to diagnosing other neurological diseases, such as autism, depression, traumatic brain injuries, and schizophrenia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DON plays important roles in primary production, nutrient availability, and carbon storage in the ocean. The compounds and structures in DON influence its role in these processes. This project uses novel methods to study amino acids, a group of small organic nitrogen compounds that make-up proteins. Specifically, the study will focus on how amino acids are converted to different forms and ?refractory DON.? Refractory DON can resist degradation and persist in the ocean for several thousand years. This study will use stable isotopes to trace the fate of nitrogen in amino acids and address important questions about marine nitrogen cycling. Findings from this study will be useful for understanding the composition of DON and how marine organisms use this form of nitrogen. In addition, this project will train graduate and undergraduate students, offer education programs to K-12 students, and enhance ocean literacy through public presentations and radio programs.<br/><br/>This project investigates the fate of nitrogen (N) in amino acids and the processes that contribute to forming refractory dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the ocean. Using stable isotope probing with 15N-labeled amino acids and controlled incubations, the study will trace the fate of different amino acids with diverse chemical structures in waters from productive coastal zones to oligotrophic open ocean waters. The proportions of amino acid-derived N that are remineralized into inorganic forms (e.g., ammonium, nitrite and nitrate), converted to labile DON, and transformed to refractory DON, will be traced and quantified. Through the comparison of labeled and unlabeled incubations, advanced high-resolution mass spectrometry techniques will be applied to characterize the molecular composition of amino acid-derived DON and compare it to naturally occurring refractory DON. The overarching goal of the project is to improve the understanding of N cycling and the processes that influence the marine DON pool. Results from this project will enhance our understanding of marine N dynamics and the molecular-level composition of the oceanic DON pool. This project will also promote STEM education by training graduate and undergraduate students through a semester by the sea program and summer internships.

The only FDA-approved intratumoral therapy costs $65,000?100,000 per patient and is insurance-reimbursed, demonstrating market viability. Pharmaceutical companies developing immune-oncology drugs are actively seeking strategic partnerships to improve drug delivery, as intravenous and oral formulations face toxicity and efficacy challenges. Intratumoral delivery is an attractive alternative, but current approaches suffer from rapid drug leakage (>70% lost within hours) and require frequent, impractical repeat dosing. Beyond its clinical benefits, this project has significant commercial potential, offering pharmaceutical companies an innovative drug delivery platform that could expand their oncology pipeline, improve therapeutic efficacy, and increase drug life cycle. The societal impact includes enhancing treatment options for patients with limited alternatives, reducing systemic toxicity, and potentially improving long-term survival rates. Early discussions with pharmaceutical executives and clinical trial physicians highlight stage IV colorectal cancer with liver or lung metastases as a high-priority clinical need. Additional interest exists in pancreatic, lung, and triple-negative breast cancers, expanding the potential market. This project aims to make intratumoral immunotherapy a viable alternative for cancer patients.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve current biologic therapies for solid tumors as they face poor on-target delivery, rapid systemic diffusion, and dose-limiting toxicities due to uncontrolled off-target effects. Systemic administration further exacerbates toxicity and efficacy limitations, restricting broader clinical adoption. This project develops an image-guided intratumoral delivery system that solidifies upon injection, ensuring localized retention and sustained therapeutic release. Unlike freely administered biologics, this approach prevents rapid leakage, aligns with clinical dosing schedules, and minimizes systemic toxicity. Our research focuses on biomaterial strategies to enhance stability, localization, and controlled release of biologics within tumors. While we have successfully developed a hydrophobic small molecule delivery system, biologic-based therapies require innovative hybrid formulations that protect, localize, and sustain release. The anticipated outcomes include improved intratumoral retention, reduced toxicity, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy, ensuring biologics remain active at the tumor site for extended durations. This novel approach optimizes tumor targeting, improves safety, and enables more effective localized immunotherapies, addressing a critical need in oncology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal is to develop new molecules that boost the body?s natural pain relief system, providing effective pain relief without the risk of addiction linked to opioids. This project will create a new generative AI system that uses scientific rules to produce better solutions and a machine learning model that uncovers hidden scientific patterns, making the AI results more understandable and reliable. This cutting-edge approach will be used to create new pain relief medications which can then be tested in labs and iteratively improved. In addition to tackling the opioid crisis, the project aims to achieve significant scientific breakthroughs that can be applied in numerous fields, enhance interdisciplinary education, and support diversity in science and engineering by incorporating the research into university programs. The GRAM-CAROLINE project demonstrates the potential of AI to solve urgent health problems while advancing scientific understanding and benefiting society.<br/><br/>The ongoing opioid crisis, resulting in over 80,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2021 alone, highlights an urgent need for safer, non-addictive pain medications.

Unlike temporary injuries, where therapeutic progress is evaluated through a follow-up appointment, chronic diseases can change in severity unpredictably and over long periods, making periodic doctor?s visits unreliable for assessing a patient?s ongoing health. One way to address this challenge is by developing tools that allow continuous monitoring of biomarkers?molecules in the body that signal disease activity. Peroxynitrite is a biomarker closely linked to disease severity, and this marker holds significant potential for improving the way chronic diseases are diagnosed and managed. However, current tools for detecting peroxynitrite are limited by their short lifespan and inability to work effectively in deep tissues. This project develops Extended Lifetime Peroxynitrite-Responsive Probes (xL-PRPs), a new class of materials designed for long-term, non-invasive monitoring of peroxynitrite levels in the body. By combining innovative probe chemistries with strategies like linking small molecules together into polymers and incorporating reversible sensing mechanisms, xL-PRPs offer the potential for long-lasting and deep-tissue visualization. This will reduce the need for traditional invasive procedures, such as biopsies, to evaluate organ health. Broader impacts of this project include outreach programs to introduce high school students to hands-on demonstrations in polymer chemistry using both technical and non-technical concepts, the development of interactive biomaterials courses to bridge undergraduate and graduate education, and mentoring initiatives to promote equitable career preparation in the chemical sciences.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The development of advanced biomaterials for long-term monitoring of oxidative stress is essential for addressing critical challenges in chronic disease diagnosis and treatment. Peroxynitrite (ONOO?), a highly reactive oxygen species strongly correlated with disease severity, presents an opportunity to revolutionize disease monitoring; however, current fluorogenic probes are hindered by single-use functionality, short in vivo activity, and inadequate imaging capabilities in deep tissues. This CAREER project focuses on the development of Extended Lifetime Peroxynitrite-Responsive Probes (xL-PRPs), a novel class of probes designed to address these limitations. The specific objectives for these xL-PRPs are to achieve: (1) reversible ONOO? responsiveness, (2) macromolecular structure for delayed in vivo tissue clearance, and (3) near-infrared fluorescence properties for enhanced imaging depth. These materials are fabricated using NITEC click chemistry and controlled polymerization techniques, while nuclear magnetic resonance, light scattering, electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy are used to investigate ONOO? interactions with these biomaterials. This work will establish the first reversible ONOO? probes responsive to biochemical scavengers in vivo, enabling localized, long-term, and non-invasive monitoring of oxidative stress. Anticipated outcomes include simplified synthetic methods, enhanced stability of ONOO? probes, and improved imaging capabilities for chronic disease monitoring.

It is only in the past few years, however, that research in oxides comprised of metallic elements lower in the periodic table has gained prominence. Oxides composed of these metals exhibit unusual properties when they conduct electricity making them strong candidates for use in quantum computation technologies. This project focuses on the synthesis of oxide thin films comprised of elements in the fourth and fifth rows of the periodic table. Researchers are studying the unusual behavior derived from materials comprised of two different elements made with atomically sharp interfaces using a technique called molecular beam epitaxy. By alternating layers of each material in a sandwich structure to produce repeating interfaces, the research focuses on making a material that exhibits the properties of the interface many times over. Through two outreach programs, exposure to science in rural and underserved areas of Alabama is broadened to groups that are not introduced to science in their daily lives. The investigator teaches annual seminars in Alabama prisons through the Alabama Prison Arts and Education Project about the applications of physics and materials science to new technologies, offering non-traditional students scientific enrichment and education during their rehabilitation that is not otherwise available. The researchers also lead the annual Gameday Physics outreach event to perform science demonstrations and introduce physics research to a broad and diverse audience at highly-attended football games on the Auburn University campus. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Complex oxides comprised of 4d and 5d transition metals exhibit significantly higher spin-orbit coupling than those comprised of 3d elements. These materials have been predicted to exhibit high temperature superconductivity and other emergent topological phenomena when formed in epitaxial thin film heterostructures and superlattices. These properties make 4d and 5d materials promising for use as materials to enable topological quantum computation. In this project, systematic studies of synthesis of several candidate 4d and 5d complex oxides via hybrid molecular beam epitaxy are performed. Using this novel approach, a metal-organic precursor replaces the traditional elemental source for the transition metal, enabling easier synthesis and producing higher quality materials. Exploration of emergent interfacial phenomena includes high-temperature superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and topological electronic states. By synthesizing superlattice films comprised of repeating interfaces, the research focuses on the development of materials that exhibit interfacial phenomena in a bulk film. This project provides educational experiences for undergraduate students to learn about materials characterization through machine learning analysis of diffraction and spectroscopy data. Computational codes to analyze such data are shared for the research community to advance real-time analysis of film synthesis. Graduate student researchers gain experience in materials synthesis and characterization in the lab and at user facilities around the world. Such experiences help prepare students for careers in materials research in the integrated circuit and electronic device industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, Li ions must move through solid-state batteries to release electricity, and then move back again to recharge. The known ?highways? of atomic motion are atomic-scale interfaces that exist between atomic building blocks called grains. Such interfaces are therefore called grain boundaries. While atoms are known to quickly move through grain boundaries, it is unclear how the rate of atomic motion changes if the atomic structures or chemistry of the grain boundaries change as well. It is possible that the rate of atomic motion may change by several orders of magnitude. This project studies how changes in grain boundaries directly affect long-range movement of atoms. Experiments examine atomic motion by studying uniquely fabricated ceramics that are made of bonded samples with different compositions, which causes certain atoms to move from one side to the other, and a variety of advanced electron microscopes are used to characterize materials on the atomic-scale. Computational models are also employed to complement experiments and understand how materials behave on the molecular level. The overall mission of this research has a wide-ranging impact on several industries related to the energy transition planned by the United States. For example, new knowledge gained from this research is likely to provide new insights about hydrogen degradation effects on steels while transporting or storing hydrogen gas, or metal dusting degradation effects on Ni alloys that are used in petrochemical plants. This research also focuses on boosting education outcomes of students at the University level as well as in grades K-12. Hands-on ceramic processing demonstrations are teaching K-12 students how ceramic materials are made, and virtual/mixed reality modules are used to accelerate training on electron microscopes and expose younger generations to how we characterize materials using state-of-the-art research facilities. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER project investigates effects of grain boundary complexion transitions on long-range mass transport in bulk ceramics and develops virtual and mixed reality applications to (i) reinvigorate materials-related curriculum at Louisiana State University and (ii) educate K-12 students, their parents, and their teachers. The research is based on prior knowledge that grain boundary complexion transformations discontinuously change bulk material behavior, yet atomic-scale mechanisms associated with diffusivity through various complexions remain unknown. This proposal evaluates grain boundary thermodynamics in ceramic diffusion couples, involves atomic-resolution microanalysis of interfaces, and uses Monte Carlo grain growth simulations of complexion-driven abnormal grain growth, while also employing in-situ electron microscopy experiments and Density Functional Theory calculations. The project is divided into 2 Research Objectives: (I) Identify Mechanisms of Discontinuities in Grain Boundary Diffusivity Related to Grain Boundary Complexion Transitions, and (II) Elucidate Effects of Interfacial Diffusion on Complexion Propagation and Microstructure Evolution. The Education Objective is to develop virtual and mixed reality training modules for electron microscopes, namely a scanning electron microscope training module for an undergraduate technical elective course, and a transmission electron microscope training module for advanced users. The Outreach Objective is to inspire K-12 students by using hands-on experiments related to ceramic processing and interactive virtual reality activities. Overall, this work provides a universal understanding of interfacial solid-state diffusion, thereby providing new insights useful to solving issues related to the energy transition, such as (i) hydrogen permeation and embrittlement in iron and nickel alloys, (ii) metal dusting degradation in steels and superalloys, and (iii) interfacial transport efficiency in next-generation solid-state ion batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given that over a million human genomes have been sequenced to date, the sheer volume of data requires advanced computational solutions for efficient analysis. Our research utilizes the Genotype Representation Graph (GRG) to improve the performance of WGS data analysis significantly. By optimizing this data structure and using modern parallel computing architectures and techniques, we aim to reduce the time required for complex genomic analyses and enable the fast and efficient processing of large datasets such as housed in the UK Biobank. This project aims to develop tools and infrastructure that will enable researchers to advance our understanding of human genetics and improve the accuracy of population genetic studies, which will ultimately contribute to better health outcomes and greater scientific knowledge. In addition, this approach to representing large, complex data sets and manipulating them effectively will serve as a proxy for modern computing approaches, to guide the design of advanced parallel computing architectures and techniques. <br/><br/>This research focuses on improving the efficiency of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis through two main objectives. The first objective is to optimize the Genotype Representation Graph (GRG) for modern parallel computing architectures, particularly GPUs, to handle the dynamic nature of genomic computations. Additionally, a matrix abstraction of the GRG will be developed, to enable efficient computation on architectures beyond GPUs by utilizing sparse matrices for near-linear scaling on distributed memory machines. The second goal is to use the improved GRG to perform accurate Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG) inference, a critical step in population genetics. By implementing and testing these approaches on the large-scale UK Biobank data, the scalability and accuracy of the novel methodologies will be demonstrated. This interdisciplinary project will combine high-performance computing advances with innovative data structures to answer key questions in population genetics and provide insights for future high-performance systems in the post-Moore?s Law era.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its 6-year duration, this Track 1 project will fund scholarships to 15 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, neuroscience, and/or physics. First year students will receive the scholarship for 4 years and transfer students will receive the scholarship for up to 3 years. This project will increase recruitment, retention, and persistence in the STEM disciplines by combining scholarship support with outreach to the local high schools, development and deployment of a multifaceted mentoring program (with faculty, peers, and profession scientists as mentors), focused and intentional cohort formation, and early participation in scientific research. As the S-STEM Scholars progress in their college careers, they will build STEM professional identities as they have the opportunity to present their research findings at professional conferences and to interact with commercial and industrial partners. They will continue to grow through service, by serving as mentors for the younger students at Monmouth College and by participating in outreach activities with the local high school students. All aspects of the activities will increase a scholarship recipient's sense of belonging in STEM. This project will increase the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM (low-income rural students) and will increase the number of STEM graduates entering the workforce, which will help meet the labor needs of the Western Illinois region and the United States. Through the evaluation of the project's activities, the project will contribute knowledge to the STEM education field by determining which of these activities are important for persistence in STEM. The project will demonstrate the significance of possible recruitment and retention pathways for low-income students and may be used as a model by similar institutions.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of academically talented, low-income undergraduate students with demonstrated financial needs. The specific aims are to recruit and to award 15 scholarships to academically talented students with financial need and have 80% (12) of the scholarship recipients graduate with a STEM bachelor's degree and enter the STEM workforce or graduate school within a year of graduation. Rural economically disadvantaged students (who often attend colleges like Monmouth College) face many challenges in attending and persisting in college: unfamiliarity with applying to college and procuring financial aid, underestimating the college workload (particularly for the STEM disciplines), and not understanding how to navigate their education and the opportunities that are provided by the college experience. These students often come from under-resourced high schools where they have little exposure to STEM and therefore do not understand the possible benefits of a career in STEM. This project recognizes their special needs and will work to support them. This project will examine the effects of various supports (personalized mentoring with a foundation in competency-based learning, seminar series that seek to introduce students to academic and career pathways, research experiences that increase self-efficacy and confidence) on the persistence of the scholars in the STEM disciplines. Qualitative and quantitative data will be gathered (academic and career outcomes, questionnaires, surveys, focus groups, etc.) to investigate which activities contributed to academic retention, graduation, and career placement, with the goal of identifying activities that have a significant effect on a student's career trajectory.  In order to disseminate results to the general public, a web page for this project will be added to the Monmouth College website. The project results will also be disseminated through presentations at disciplinary specific conferences as well as through manuscripts in peer-reviewed STEM and academic journals. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, oyster reefs have declined by over 85% globally in recent years. Given the urgent need to protect and re-establish oyster reefs, a better understanding of the response of these food webs to urbanization threats and restoration efforts is needed. This research will assess the relative importance of predatory crabs in the food webs of restored versus degraded oyster reef habitats. The results of this research will provide insights into the resilience of coastal systems and should inform future restoration.  This project features graduate and undergraduate student training, and the development of an immersive course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) where students gain training in field ecology, data visualization, and science communication. Findings from this research will be shared through academic publications, public outreach activities, and student training programs to maximize impact. This project is co-funded by the Biological Oceanography Program, Population and Community Ecology in the Division of Environmental Biology, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), which provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs.<br/><br/>Ecological communities are comprised of many species in complex webs of interactions. These interactions may vary among environments that differ in thermal regime and across an environmental gradient of increasing urbanization. This project connects three aims to determine how warming and urbanization interact with each other and with body size of crab predators to affect a shift in crab diet with cascading effects to the trophic, and overall community, structures of oyster reefs in estuarine habitats. First, mesocosm experiments will be used to test the hypothesis that temperature and crab body size interact to induce a shift in crab diets. A second hypothesis will test the strength of predation by crabs in situ using manipulative caging experiments across 8 paired urbanized and rural oyster reefs in the Chesapeake Bay to evaluate the extent to which urbanization of estuarine sites impacts community structure. The third hypothesis will test whether urbanization of estuaries induces a shift in crab diets that changes both the strength of predation and the nature of estuarine community trophic structure by comparing stable isotope ratios at 8 paired restored and degraded oyster reefs. Outcomes of tests of these three hypotheses will advance understanding of how environmental changes in temperature and land use (urbanization, habitat restoration) affect the strength of top-down control of community structure through shifts in consumer diets and how altered trophic structure may, in turn, influence ecosystem resilience differently in restored, unmanipulated or urbanized habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2023, kidney cancer impacted 81,800 Americans. Due to a lack of early detection methods for kidney cancer, most kidney tumors are found incidentally during diagnostic imaging for other purposes. The proposed project will be the development of a novel, non-invasive kidney cancer screening test for use prior to imaging, to reduce unnecessary risk from imaging tests, to enable earlier cancer detection, and to serve as a preventive test for high-risk populations (age 50 to 75). A positive diagnosis through the proposed screening test will result in healthcare providers proceeding with confirmatory imaging tests for further analysis. Using this test, malignant tumor cells in the kidneys and urinary tract will be detected in urine specimens, allowing for the initial detection of cancer and monitoring molecular residual disease (MRD). Due to the current lack of an effective biomarker or screening test for kidney cancer, there is significant commercial potential for the proposed test. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project seeks to develop a novel screening and surveillance test for kidney cancer from urine. Currently, there are no screening methods for kidney cancer aside from imaging modalities such as a computed tomography (CT) imaging. While non-invasive, use of routine imaging for kidney cancer screening is an impractical and costly approach for the general population. The proposed project will have these objectives: 1) Demonstrate the specificity and accuracy of the biomarker for the detection of renal tumors from kidney cancer patients at early-stage disease without symptoms; 2) Demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the test for detecting residual disease in kidney cancer patients of post-nephrectomy. If the proposed project is successful, the work will pave the way for developing and offering the test as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) service through a single validated clinical lab, and later pursuing FDA approval as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD). This noninvasive test will be easily accepted by a broad range of patients from different cultural backgrounds. As a result, this will help to increase the survival rate of kidney cancer patients who are diagnosed at an early stage without symptoms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the US, nine of the top ten costliest natural disasters have been caused by TCs, commonly known as hurricanes. One of the grand challenges in TC forecasting is accurately predicting when and where these storms will develop, referred to as TC genesis. Current operational forecasts provide 1 ? 2-week outlooks for TC genesis, but with limited skill, and predictions at 3? 6-week lead time remain a knowledge gap. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a 30 ? 90-day atmospheric mode in the Indo-Pacific region, is known to influence TC genesis worldwide. However, the precise physical drivers of this relationship are unknown. This research leverages interpretable machine learning (ML) to uncover the nonlinear relationships between the MJO and TC genesis, which may not be easily detected using conventional statistical methods. By applying deep learning techniques, this study aims to improve TC genesis prediction at 1 ? 2 week lead times and explore the feasibility of extending prediction to 3 ? 6 weeks. The project provides broader societal and educational benefits, including supporting graduate student training in ML, developing a public outreach demonstration website, and sharing machine-learning-ready datasets and open-source code for the research community and the public.<br/><br/>The research will use deep learning neural networks to better understand and predict how the MJO convection physically influences TC genesis at 1 ? 6-week lead times. This Lagrangian MJO-LPT data will provide the actual locations of the MJO convection and integrate with 3-D atmospheric fields including geopotential height, winds, and relative humidity for the first time. It distinguishes from traditional MJO indices that are based on anomalies. Using the full spatio-temporal evolution of MJO convection together with 3-D fields is a major advancement beyond current methods of TC genesis prediction that rely on 1-D inputs. Interpretability methods, including saliency maps, spatial sensitivity, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), will be used to uncover characteristic spatio-temporal patterns that identify atmospheric teleconnections. The associated dynamical systems such as jet streams, troughs, and ridges are hypothesized to mediate the MJO?s effect on TC genesis. The deep learning models developed in this project are expected to improve the physical understanding needed for TC genesis prediction at 1 ? 6 week lead times.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology provides a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution that enhances accessibility to real-time health data for individuals with anxiety disorders, cardiovascular conditions, and other medical concerns requiring continuous monitoring. This solution addresses the lack of affordable, real-time, and continuous health monitoring for individuals at risk of critical health events, such as panic attacks or cardiac irregularities. Current wearable solutions either lack accuracy due to motion interference or require high power consumption, limiting their usability for long-term monitoring. With the U.S. facing an increasing prevalence of chronic health conditions and a growing demand for remote patient monitoring, there is need for an energy-efficient, reliable, and scalable solution that bridges the gap between clinical-grade monitoring and consumer accessibility.

By requiring students to collaborate in the development of a software product, team projects provide students with authentic learning experiences that prepare them for careers in the computing profession. In undergraduate education, a key challenge is to assess individual contributions to team projects. This project plans to develop a novel teaching and assessment approach in which students compile individual portfolios documenting and reflecting on their completed project tasks relative to the outcomes they address. Instructional staff and peers then assess a sample of each student?s portfolio entries against appropriate performance indicators associated with the learning outcomes targeted by the team project. Since the framework will be readily adaptable to any team project, the approach can be used for team projects in any STEM degree program. This Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project will thus help advance undergraduate STEM education by improving the ability to assess students engaged in team projects.<br/><br/>Using a rigorous empirical approach that involves computing instructors at multiple institutions, computing students, software professionals, and a learning scientist, this project will iteratively develop and validate (a) an assessment framework to gauge attainment of student learning outcomes targeted by collaborative software development projects; and (b) a pedagogical approach that integrates the assessment framework into computing courses. By aiming to improve assessment methods for team projects, the framework will contribute to the development of exemplary practices in undergraduate STEM education. Through their participation in the framework, students will enter the workforce with better self-knowledge and documentation of their skills, thus helping employers to integrate new hires into positions that align with those skills. The framework will be designed to be flexible enough to facilitate its adoption across a broad range of STEM courses. Moreover, the framework aims to assess students' attainment of a variety of learning outcomes in addition to those captured by traditional assessments. In so doing, it aims to help broaden the participation of STEM students from different backgrounds. By documenting, reflecting on, and receiving feedback on their individual attainment of learning outcomes in team projects, students will be better prepared for employment in the professional workforce, where team projects are a central activity. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ion channels serve as essential cellular gatekeepers that control numerous vital physiological processes, from heartbeat to nerve signals. Glycosylation is a process where sugar molecules attach to proteins. While scientists have established that these sugar modifications significantly influence channel function, the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood due to their complex and dynamic nature. Using advanced computational modeling techniques, Dr. Li's team aims to create detailed molecular maps that reveal how these sugar modifications interact with and regulate ion channels at the atomic level. The project will create a training program for Mississippi students, particularly in the growing field of computational chemical biology, helping to build the next generation of scientists. By combining cutting-edge computational research with educational outreach, this work not only advances our understanding of fundamental cellular processes but also strengthens America's scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to understand the effects of N-glycosylation on ion-channels by investigating atomic-level glycan-protein interactions using advanced molecular dynamics simulation techniques. At the atomic level, this study will reveal the chemical basis and molecular recognition of N-glycans governing ion channel gating. It will elucidate how the inherent flexibility and heterogeneity of glycans structurally impact the function of multiple ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels. At the molecular and cellular level, this research will address an understudied yet critical aspect of ion channel structure-function relationships, that is how isoform-specific N-glycosylation regulates subunit composition and gating behaviors, resulting in differential electrical signaling in the brain, heart, and muscle.

Simulation relies on numerical solvers whose continued improvements in terms of speed and accuracy are of pivotal national importance. Unfortunately, the progress of solvers is hampered by two emerging challenges: (1) the problems being modeled and solved, including their data captured through matrices, are becoming numerically harder, causing many solvers to fail; (2) newer arithmetic hardware, increasingly second-purposed from those developed to support artificial intelligence (AI), ends up having suboptimal precision while also deviating from established numerical standards. The project's novelties are: (1) the development of practical formal methods that are capable of capturing the correctness expectations of numerical algorithm designers as formal requirements; (2) the development of formal models capable of modeling non-standard hardware while bridging their behavioral differences to present uniform higher level formal abstractions; and (3) methods to carry out end-to-end correctness verification that help establish that the formal models of the underlying hardware meet the numerical algorithm correctness requirements. The project's contributions will help advance the nation's simulation-based scientific exploration capabilities. It will also help recoup the investments already made in today's numerical solvers, allowing them to be easily and reliably adapted to new problems and hardware. Without these capabilities, scientific computing and data-enabled discoveries can experience multiple productivity gaps, negatively impacting scientific research and engineering advances. The project will also train students to have the debugging skills necessary to solve numerical issues arising in the context of future solver design and deployment.<br/><br/>This project handles data hardness using iterative refinement algorithms that are followed by the linear algebra routines underlying linear solvers. These algorithms can be verifiably guarded by novel formal properties that stem from how the problem eigenvalues appear in the problem?s data matrices. This project's techniques adapt the numerical hardware to pre-existing solvers (and their assumptions) and help develop new solvers that employ mixed numerical precision schemes during iterative refinement. These adaptations will be aided by novel emulation schemes that help match and formally verify numerical precision, rounding rules, and floating-point exception handling rules. The goals of these techniques are to resolve the ""Data/Numerics Tug of War"" so that each solver developer obtains their preferred starting point: from algorithms down to hardware or vice-versa. This project will contribute key scientific principles and algorithms to support future research and development activities in adapting solvers to newer hardware. It will have a broad impact, including (1) sustain established solvers across new generations of hardware and (2) solve numerical issues that arise when solvers and optimizers used in AI are enhanced to handle larger scale and newer problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Less is known about sign languages compared to spoken languages. The sign language examined in this doctoral dissertation project is important because it is a young language. Studying young languages helps scientists understand how languages develop and change over time. In some theories, the structure of new languages depends on ways in which human brains are hard-wired to learn language from birth. In other theories, the structure of new languages comes mainly from the ways people communicate and interact with each other. This doctoral dissertation project investigates a young sign language that has never been studied in detail by linguists before. The results reveal a timeline of how a language develops that could provide evidence for or against these theories, thus advancing a more comprehensive scientific understanding of human language. Other benefits to society include educational opportunities and workforce development for students involved in the research.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project yields a sign language grammar and an archive of language samples. Data are gathered by interviewing three groups of people: those who were born before the language began, those who were children during the early period of the language, and those who grew up after the language was established. Past research has found that people keep using language features they learned when they were young. Studying the language of different generations is used to infer language change over time. This study collects information about linguistic structures by having participants do communication tasks such as describing what they see in a photograph, reversing a sentence from a positive to a negative, or filling in a gap in a sentence. These tasks elicit specific expressions, including verbs in different tenses or different types of clauses. The researchers also gather data on language transmission at the level of individual language users. Data and language samples are made available in a public archive, providing an important resource for education and research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, billions of humans still depend on dense and predictable resources, namely agriculture. Previous studies suggest that agriculture allowed humans to become sedentary, leading to greater technological advancements and forms of resource defense and stratification. Recent archaeological evidence suggests these adaptations predate agricultural development and, thus, may be more ancient than previously thought. However, before archaeologists can determine how far back in time these adaptations exist, they must first understand how other forms of dense and predictable resources, like fish and shellfish, impacted hunter-gatherer behaviors. As such, this project yields insights into the role of aquatic resources in human evolution, providing comparative data for global studies of hunter-gatherer adaptation. The project supports education and training by involving students and engaging local communities while fostering scientific collaboration. Educational outreach, including the development of language material and a database of archaeological data on aquatic exploitation, extends the impact of this work to a variety of audiences and educational settings. This interdisciplinary project contributes to theoretical and methodological advancements in archaeology and anthropology while enriching understanding of past, present, and future human responses to resource challenges. <br/><br/>Researchers investigate how intensified aquatic resource use influenced hunter-gatherers' technological and mobility decisions over the past 5,000 years.

This project tracks how hunter-gatherers made, maintained, and sourced their stone tools before and during aquatic intensification. This allows the researchers to explore whether shifts in dietary focus?toward marine and freshwater resources?altered hunter-gatherer strategies for tool utility, raw material use, and mobility patterns.

This technology aims to solve two fundamental problems of traditional coral restoration where corals are transported from nurseries and secured back onto reef habitats: (1) that coral reefs naturally develop slowly over centuries, which means coral restoration efforts are slow to offer measurable returns to investors; and (2) that successful restoration of the reef ecosystem and concomitant services is dependent on coral survival, which is threatened on many levels. The strategy offered by this project is to replace the structure of mature reefs and provide immediate valuable shoreline protection and fish habitat, so that this approach to restoring reef ecosystem services can succeed even when coral mortality events occur. More traditional shoreline protection structures like seawalls change the physical parameters of the marine environment, making customers choose between habitat restoration and coastal protection. This technology offers both long term storm damage reduction to shoreline properties and increased value of natural ecosystems and the resultant blue economy.<br/><br/><br/>The product under development in this project is an engineered habitat support structure for reef ecosystems, novel for its relatively larger size and degree of surface complexity. Most artificial reef systems are orders of magnitude smaller or are constructed of large piles of recycled materials that lack the surface features critical to nature-based solutions. While the proposed technology may demand large upfront investments, it can substantially shorten the recovery time of degraded reefs by facilitating self-organization of supporting ecosystems. A major innovation of the product is its modular design, which will allow it to be built of scalable block-like components while also being customizable to a variety of installation sites. This Phase I project will test the feasibility of developing this product as a commercial technology that can be built and installed at scales relevant to coral restoration and shoreline protection needs for customers in several industries across the Caribbean. It will also test tradeoffs between strength and mass of various block shapes, and a variety of block joints that can be used to reduce the cost of construction without reducing the performance of the resulting structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of these projects is to take theoretical results and make progress towards using them in practice. To illustrate our approach, we list four real examples of topics studied in this project and describe how they serve the national interest. <br/>(1) Making programs run faster (e.g., by making them parallel so they can be run using multiple computers or cores). This will benefit all sciences as more and more work in science relies on fast computation. Note that the most recent Nobel prize in Chemistry went to work that used computation in a major way. <br/>(2) Making computer more secure (e.g., by studying secure cryptography and efficient communication schemes). Advancing secure communication is important for both the Military and Financial sectors. <br/>(3) Getting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make less errors. AI now plays a critical role in healthcare, e.g., in disease diagnosis, selecting treatment, clinical lab testing, drug discovery, and many other tasks. Many such applications are hampered by the fact that AI can make errors and harm people as a result. Practical research on AI aimed at reducing mistakes is important for the health and prosperity of our nation. <br/>(4) Make quantum computers practical. Sometime in the future practical quantum computing may be a reality. We need to both hasten this advance and know how to take advantage of it. Two important applications are simulating quantum mechanics (which will help science) and cryptography (which is important for security). <br/>This program will give undergraduate students a unique opportunity to do research. This is especially important for students who normally do not have that opportunity, in particular, students from non-research-focused schools and from underrepresented groups. There will be a special effort to recruit such students. This effort will increase the number of researchers which will help science and technology progress faster. This program will give students an idea of what graduate school is like in two ways: <br/>(1) their research projects are scaled down versions of Ph.D. theses; and <br/>(2) there will be interaction with other students in Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs, current graduate students, and faculty. <br/><br/>The students will be offered a variety of research projects, and will also be given a strong voice in the creation of their own projects. We list sample projects below: <br/>(1) Parallel Computing: If one computer or core can solve a problem in time T then perhaps p computers (cores) can solve that problem in T/p time. In this project students will study how to design practical and efficient algorithms that can be run on real-world parallel computers and obtain large speedups. <br/>(2) Cryptography and Security: Most current cryptosystems are based on factoring (or other problems in number theory) being hard. Since factoring might become easy due to quantum computers becoming realistic, there has been much work on designing alternative cryptosystems. This project will code up these alternatives to test if they are easy to use, efficient, and secure. <br/>(3) Question-Answering Systems (AI): There are many AI programs that will, given a question, try to answer it. If the question is given as text, they often do very well. If the question is given as an image (e.g., ""is this a dog?"") then they often do poorly. This project will discern which questions they do badly on and strive to make the system better. <br/>(4) Quantum Error Correction: If Alice sends a string of (classical) bits over a noisy line then she can use error-correction techniques that will detect and correct errors. One obstacle to real quantum computers is the lack of good error-correction for qubits. This project will study known quantum error correction  techniques and extend them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the resources used to accomplish this take away from resources devoted to maintaining normal cell functions, which can often result in reduced cell growth. This project will explore using light to control metabolic pathways with the goal of balancing production of valuable products and normal cell growth.  The outcomes of this research could lead to advances in sustainable production by enabling light-controlled strategies for optimizing biosynthesis in real time. The research program is complemented by educational outreach. Most notable are efforts partnering with the STEM Pathways program to host an event at the Cambridge Science Festival. The project will also provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Designing and testing protein-level optogenetic regulation for metabolic engineering is promising and challenging. As a test case, the researchers will focus on octanoic acid, used in production of fuels, plastics, surfactants, and other products. Octanoic acid can be produced in Escherichia coli via expression of heterologous thioesterases. Production of octanoic acid is metabolically taxing, motivating the need for dynamic strategies to shift cellular resources between growth and production. First, the researchers will develop a novel method for generating light-inducible proteins. They will use a domain insertion approach to construct libraries of proteins containing a modular photodomain and will subject these libraries to selection to generate novel light-responsive thioesterases. Second, the project will comprehensively test light induction strategies to map the impact of temporal parameters associated with light exposure to production outcomes. This approach will provide insight into the differences between alternative optogenetic implementations and their ultimate impact on production. Third, the researchers will implement real-time feedback control to dynamically regulate growth and production. By implementing closed-loop control, the researchers will design autonomous methods for regulating bioproduction that are responsive to current conditions. The strategy is designed to capitalize on the unique benefits of reversibility and tunability that light affords to balance the trade-off between production and growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the availability of freshwater limits economic development and agriculture, especially in the Western U.S., and in many other parts of the world. The goal of the technology is to produce freshwater from saltwater in a sustainable way. The solution was inspired by naturally occurring mangroves. The technology uses plants that have been biologically engineered to filter seawater and ?pump? or produce freshwater. These genetically enhanced plants have specialized root barriers that allow them to filter saltwater. This technology may provide a sustainable, economic option to freshwater scarcity.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of genetically engineered plants to produce freshwater from saltwater. Inspired by the water filtering capabilities of mangroves, living plants are developed using a synthetic biology platform where it is possible to add specialized root epidermal barriers to any plant species allowing the plant to filter saltwater. Also, the plants are engineered with a synthetic system to ?pump? the purified freshwater by refactoring well characterized genes and directing their expression to the plant?s xylem. The goal is to provide a decentralized water purification ability using the sun to power photosynthetic water purification, which may reduce energy costs comparable to that of solar panels. The technology has been demonstrated in a model laboratory plant, and calculations suggest that the technology, when scaled, may provide freshwater volumes equivalent to that of energy intensive thermal mechanical sites.

This is true of conventional fluids such as liquids like water or gases like air, and is also true of plasmas. This award supports a study of the impact different types of obstacles make on turbulent, magnetized plasma flow in a tunnel vacuum chamber. Since plasma can interact with electric and magnetic fields, the targets in these experiments can be both solid objects made of material such as ceramic, or magnetic field structures generated either by permanent magnets or by driving current through wires crossing the chamber. Interpretation of measurements made in these experiments can be used to help better understand naturally occurring instances of magnetized plasma flowing past obstacles.  A prime example of such plasma is the solar wind flowing by both non-magnetic objects like the Moon and magnetic obstacles like the Earth?s magnetosphere, where the new understanding can contribute to space weather prediction both here on Earth and on other planets. This work can also be important for better characterization of the plasma flow interactions with potentially vulnerable human-made objects such as spacecraft or satellite constellations.  The project will also have an important workforce development component in engaging and training the next generation of plasma scientists at both graduate and undergraduate level to contribute to the US national security and economic prosperity in their future careers. <br/><br/>This award supports an experiment with a coaxial plasma gun launching a turbulent magnetized plasma at high speeds down a 0.25m wide, 2.5m long cylindrical vacuum chamber.  The experimental plasma and flow parameters will be varied from low-to-high beta values as well as from sub-to-super Alfvenic or Mach numbers. Embedded within this flow will be obstacles which can interact with and modify the flowing plasma as well as affect the characteristics of the observed turbulence within the plasma. These obstacles can be solid objects made of either insulating non-magnetic materials such as ceramic or conducting non-magnetic materials such as copper; or magnetic field configurations including axial field generated by pulsed current in a straight wire traversing the diameter of the chamber or dipole fields produced by pulsed current through wire coils or with strong permanent magnets.  Differences in the resulting turbulence characteristics will be explored via several analysis techniques including spectral decomposition, correlation, and intermittency analysis. Measurements will be made using inserted probes as well as via non-invasive spectroscopic methods, with comparisons to naturally occurring plasma flow obstacle encounters such as bow shocks, magnetotails, or depletion wakes to be pursued within the experimental system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These facts will be represented in the form of knowledge graphs that capture the knowledge about signaling networks within immunotherapeutic cells, connecting newly designed receptors or pathways with markers of important processes, such as cytotoxicity and stemness. Further, GNN architectures will be utilized when exploring and improving the knowledge graphs, as well as when explaining the dynamic behavior of signaling networks within the tumor microenvironment. This project will also develop methods for reliably identifying and resolving inconsistencies in knowledge graphs when studying intracellular signaling. This work will provide new AI algorithmic approaches that incorporate scientific facts and principles within learning and reasoning to ensure explainable and trustworthy predictions.

Through providing immediate AI-powered feedback on reading comprehension, writing and creativity skills, Inspire Reading will help prepare students for future challenges and the workforce. Positioned at the intersection of educational technology, cognitive science, and AI-driven assessment, Inspire Reading targets the $8 billion reading intervention market. By year three we aim to reach 500,000 students. The AI Feedback for Creativity (AIFC) auto feedback system, alignment to state standards, and focus on creativity provide a durable competitive advantage, making it a key driver of commercial success in the fast-growing AI-powered learning market with the goal of improving literacy for the two-thirds of the nation's 4th- and 8th-grade students scoring below levels of proficiency. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project centers on the development of an AI-powered feedback system for creativity (AIFC) designed to enhance literacy and creative thinking skills within the context of ELA learning. This addresses the pressing need for improved reading and writing outcomes as highlighted by national assessments. The technical challenges lie in fine-tuning and prompt engineering Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately evaluate and provide constructive feedback on creative writing across diverse ELA activities, age groups, and proficiency levels. The research objectives include developing and validating proprietary AI algorithms aligned to the unique literacy fluency, comprehension, and creativity-based project while ensuring data integrity and privacy and conducting field data collection and usability studies. The anticipated technical results include a robust AI feedback system capable of providing real-time, personalized feedback that fosters both creativity and literacy skills, thereby enhancing ELA education through improved literacy rates and improving long-term student outcomes. The primary technical risks stem from fine-tuning and prompt engineering challenges unique to maintaining educationally valid and reliable outcomes, to ensure model effectiveness across varying ELA standards, age groups, and proficiency levels. These risks will be mitigated through extensive research, iterative development, and rigorous evaluation to ensure the AI model's efficacy and reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reproducibility, or the ability of a third party to substantially recreate the same results of a previous experiment using the same code, conditions, and input data, is therefore crucial as a means of closing the gap between initial discovery and widespread adoption of claims. However, the discipline of computer security has historically performed poorly in this regard. Improving reproducibility in computer security is not only important in making the results of research more trustworthy but also has the potential to speed up efforts by other scientists to build on results, and to take their results out of the laboratory and into practice via commercialization or open-source.<br/><br/>This project has two main activities. First, the project team is performing large-scale reproducibility studies across important venues in computer security, characterizing how previously published efforts achieve or fail to allow for reproducible science. Next, the team is focusing on why such efforts fail and is creating improved frameworks for expressing gaps and limitations in the use of artifacts. The team is creating a framework to more readily characterize replicability, wherein artifacts are more broadly profiled using new data sets. These efforts will not only provide the community with benchmarks and guidance for improved performance but will also assist in making the results of the community's research efforts more readily transitioned to the world beyond research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the particles can destabilize the film, reducing the transport efficiency and resulting in an ill-controlled deposition and contamination of substrates. The classical description of films of pure liquid fails to capture the interplay between the air-liquid interface and the particles. This CAREER project will characterize and model the role of interfaces in suspension dynamics, using state-of-the-art experimental studies coupled with numerical simulations. The results will advance the fundamental understanding of suspension flows under confinement, establishing when and how particles disturb thin liquid films. The proposed work will provide a framework to model and control advanced coating, aerosol-based treatments, and transport in porous media. As a result, this CAREER project will have a broad environmental and economic impact. The research will provide educational opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, in particular from under-represented groups. An integrated curriculum on water contamination will inspire the participation of local K-12 and undergraduate students in STEM.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER award is to develop a new understanding of capillary dynamics when solid non-Brownian particles are dispersed in a Newtonian liquid phase. This configuration encompasses a variety of fundamental problems and practical situations. Past studies have focused on surface tension effects during the formation of liquid films and drops of a pure Newtonian liquid. However, when the liquid contains solid particles, the rheological description of a suspension fails to capture the interfacial dynamics at play when the thickness of the liquid becomes comparable to the particle size. The experimental approach bridging different length and time scales will describe how the bulk behavior and local heterogeneities contribute to the dynamics of capillary objects. More specifically, the study will consider model thin films, self-suspended or bound by a solid surface. First, the formation of a thin-film of suspension on a substrate will illustrate how the particles are entrained and deposited depending on the dynamic wetting and stability of suspension films. The researchers will then examine suspension sheets and their atomization to provide guidelines to describe sprays. The fundamental knowledge obtained through the proposed work will lead to a better description of multiphase flows involving a solid dispersed phase during the formation, flow, and fragmentation of suspension films and sheets. In addition to improving process efficiency, the knowledge should bolster the development of new coating processes and inspire further research on heterogeneous capillary flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This combination of parameters is difficult to study.  It is still unknown how mechanical forces, including external forces applied to the tissue and forces within the tissue due to those external forces, influences the evolution of tissue shape. The main hypothesis of the project is that cells can be directed to create a desired tissue shape, structure, and size by applying controlled dynamic mechanical signals. These mechanical signals can be applied and removed on-demand, and they can quickly spread long distances.  The application of a force in the tissue can be controlled precisely using robotic micromanipulation tools. The goal of this project is to use computational design tools to instruct robotic manipulation in a way that will uncover the mechanical laws and physical forces that drive connective tissue morphogenesis. The results will enable the use of mechanobiology to engineer tissues. Novel materials will be developed for undergraduate and graduate courses, and the next generation of engineers and scientists will be trained in microfabrication, cell biology, continuum mechanics, magnetics, materials science, and robotics. <br/><br/>This project aims to uncover fundamental mechanistic principles of connective tissue morphogenesis and introduce computational design tools that would instruct the use of robotic micromanipulation tools with the goal of harnessing mechanobiology to engineer architected tissues.

These models will recapitulate the concurrent alignment, rearrangement and deposition of the ECM. Imaging and mechanical characterization techniques will spatiotemporally map tissue rheology and architecture, generating a dataset that will be used to validate the computational models. Combined experimental and computational work will aid in the discovery of the physical principles of mechanosensitive cell migration in morphing and structurally remodeling fibrous tissues. The integrated model will predict the evolution of cell movement and ECM architecture along with the tissue morphology under dynamic mechanical loading. The integrative model that recapitulates both ECM remodeling and cell migration will guide tissue folding. Under robotic micromanipulation informed by the model, bilayer tissues will fold into 3D tissues with pre-defined shapes and internal architectures. The work has scientific, societal, and educational impact. This work has the potential to uncover multi-cellular organization principles that drive developmental patterning, wound healing, and pathological responses such as fibrosis that involve cell migration and ECM remodeling in fibrous tissues.

Natural terrains are complex and feature various types of clutters and confinements that restrict movement. In order to locomote through them effectively, robots must be small, as well as malleable and reconfigurable into terrain-specific body shapes just like their animal counterparts who expertly vary their body shapes and limb configurations. Thus inspired, this CAREER project aims to create a novel class of insect-scale exoskeletal robots that can passively conform to environmental restrictions, sense these constraints, and actively vary shape to be proficient at locomotion. In the long term, this research will improve the agility and adaptability of robotic systems and hasten their integration into real-world operations. Such shape-shifting miniature robots would squeeze through a pile of debris to autonomously locate survivors during search-and-rescue efforts, crawl inside a human body cavity to carefully remove tumors while assisting surgical procedures, or scurry between the blades of a jet engine to rapidly inspect and repair blade damage from bird collisions for the significant benefit of our society, health, and economy.

By leveraging insights from experimentally driven enhanced shape analysis and first principles-based effective shape finding, the project strives to take the first step towards rationally designing high-performance shape-shifting robots for applications beyond confined space locomotion. The project intends to demonstrate mapping and locomotion in GPS-denied confined environments utilizing a bioinspired tactile probe, a much-needed capability for effective complex real-world navigation.

As part of a broader national effort spanning different types of institutions of higher education, this initiative seeks to expand the NAIRR Pilot community by equipping educators with the tools and knowledge needed to bring AI learning experiences into classrooms nationwide.<br/><br/>The project has four primary goals: (1) facilitate increased instructional capacity and develop a sustainable community of practice among faculty at four-year institutions who are implementing AI courses or modules into undergraduate curricula; (2) establish a shared understanding of best practices for AI education relevant to four-year institutions; (3) improve faculty confidence at 4-year institutions in using NAIRR Pilot resources for AI instruction; and (4) develop strategies for integrating AI content into undergraduate courses, particularly where computational resources are limited. The virtual roundtable discussions will bring educators together in small groups to identify challenges and barriers to increasing AI education capacity and effectively utilizing NAIRR Pilot resources. Insights gathered from these discussions will shape the agenda for an in-person workshop, where participants will further explore these challenges, opportunities, and available resources. The workshop will culminate in a publicly available report outlining best practices, example implementations, and recommendations for leveraging NAIRR Pilot resources in AI education. By combining virtual and in-person engagement, the project fosters collaboration, enhances accessibility, and supports faculty in expanding AI education at four-year institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Originating in biology and now influencing fields as varied as management science, artificial intelligence, and robotics, this concept underscores the potential of collaborative efforts in solving complex challenges. On the other hand, the quest for finding global minimizers of nonconvex optimization problems arises in physics and chemistry, as well as in machine learning due to the widespread adoption of deep learning. Building the bridge between these two seemingly disparate realms, this project will utilize Collective Intelligence to leverage the interacting particle systems as a means to address the formidable challenge of finding global minimizers in nonconvex optimization problems. Graduate students will also be integrated within the research team as part of their professional training. <br/><br/>This project will focus on a gradient-free optimization method inspired by a consensus-based interacting particle system to solve different types of nonconvex optimization problems. Effective communication and cooperation among particles within the system play pivotal roles in efficiently exploring the landscape and converging to the global minimizer. Aim 1 targets nonconvex optimization with equality constraints; and Aim 2 addresses nonconvex optimization on convex sets; while Aim 3 applies to Clustered Federated Learning. Additionally, convergence guarantees will be provided for nonconvex and nonsmooth objective functions. Theoretical analyses, alongside practical implementations, will provide valuable insights and tools for addressing different types of nonconvex optimization challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zinc is a micronutrient essential for all life forms. Zinc supplementation is a proven method to treat taste loss, and zinc is a potent inhibitor of sweet taste, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Zinc transporters are ?chokepoint? proteins located in the cell membrane that mediate the movement of zinc into and out of cells and subcellular compartments, thereby regulating intracellular zinc concentration. The key zinc transporters and other zinc-regulated proteins that regulate taste cell regeneration will be identified using gene expression studies in taste buds of mice fed a zinc-deficient diet and by targeted gene deletion of zinc transporters in mouse taste organoids, a tissue culture system that ?mimics taste buds in a dish.? To determine how zinc inhibits sweet taste, the changes in behavioral, neural and cellular responses to sweeteners in knockout mice and in taste organoids that lack a sweet taste-cell-specific zinc transporter gene will be determined. The integrated educational and outreach programs aim to train the next generation of STEM workforce and promote nutritional literacy to the public. To this end, summer internships and mentoring will be provided to community college students wishing to transition into four-year colleges, and nutrition literacy will be provided through scientific demonstrations at community outreach programs and at classes for adults. Ultimately, this research will help develop improved methods to treat taste loss and prevent overconsumption of calorie-dense, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages in humans.<br/><br/>This project uses gene expression, cell physiology, histology, taste nerve recordings and taste behavior analysis to advance understanding of the roles of zinc transporters and other zinc-regulated proteins in taste cells. CRISPR knockout array screens of zinc transporters in mouse taste organoids, followed by single cell gene expression, will be used to identify key taste-stem-cell-expressed zinc transporters and zinc-regulated genes ex vivo. The results of these experiments will help identify key zinc transporters, zinc-regulated proteins and signaling pathways that are required for taste cell regeneration. In addition, zinc-regulated genes will be identified in vivo by single-cell and spatial gene expression of taste papillae of mice fed a zinc-deficient diet. The roles of the sweet-taste-cell-expressed zinc transporter Slc39a8 in behavioral responses and taste nerve responses to sweeteners will be determined by comparing the Slc39a8 conditional knockout mouse strain and control strain. Sweetener-stimulated zinc and calcium fluxes in taste organoids cultured from both mice strains will be measured, and the roles of extracellular versus intracellular zinc will be studied using cell membrane -impermeant and -permeant zinc chelators, respectively. Together, the combination of behavioral, electrophysiological and mechanistic studies will shed light on how zinc inhibits sweet taste signaling. The findings from both tasks will be highly translatable to related tissues such as the skin and olfactory and intestinal epithelia where zinc plays important roles in development, regeneration, and metabolism. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program, the BIO-IOS-Activation Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without timely data collection, valuable insights into recovery efforts, resource availability, and resilience-building are lost. Wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity, yet there are critical gaps in documenting how communities prepare for, experience, and recover from these disasters. The project systematically gathers and preserves this data, making it publicly available for researchers, policymakers, and disaster recovery professionals. By improving access to essential information, it informs communities on rebuilding activities and policymakers on risk reduction strategies.<br/><br/>This project collects essential data to advance understanding of how human and community-level factors shape wildfire risk, impacts, and recovery. It addresses critical gaps in post-disaster data, which are rarely collected systematically yet are vital for improving disaster recovery modeling and strengthening long-term community resilience. Through official documents, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus groups with community-based organizations, the project focuses on three key areas: (1) the transition from emergency response to recovery governance, (2) the structure and effectiveness of evolving recovery frameworks, and (3) the policies, obstacles, and support systems influencing recovery, including the changing role of philanthropic and nonprofit organizations. By capturing multiple snapshots of the recovery process over a year, it gains unique insights that inform broader disaster risk modeling, resilience planning, and policy development. The data is publicly shared through the NHERI DesignSafe Data Depot, ensuring accessibility for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners working to enhance wildfire resilience nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developments in nanotechnology are changing the ways pesticides are formulated. Nano-based approaches offer targeted pest control, sustained release, and improved stability compared to conventional products. However, it is important to understand how pesticide-bearing nanoparticles behave once they are introduced into an agricultural setting.  This project will investigate the behavior of cyclodextrin-based particles, which is a key class of nanopesticides. Using both experimental and numerical computational approaches, the project will examine how these particles aggregate and attach to relevant materials such as silica and cellulose. The resulting fundamental knowledge will guide agricultural and industrial sectors toward safer and more effective pesticide formulations that protect crops while minimizing risks to waterbodies. Integrated research and education activities will introduce learners to advanced nanomaterial studies, foster practical innovation in pesticide development, and promote informed decision-making that protects vital water resources. This approach will support workforce development and advance more sustainable farming methods.<br/><br/>This research applies an integrated experimental and computational framework to investigate how the encapsulation of pesticide molecules within cyclodextrin alters colloidal self-assembly, transport, and adsorption in aqueous systems and solid-liquid interfaces. Systematic studies using dynamic light scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy will determine how active ingredient loading affects the formation, size distribution, and charge properties of cyclodextrin-based clusters. Parallel molecular dynamics simulations with free energy calculations will reveal atomic-level driving forces for self-assembly and the thermodynamics of cyclodextrin-nanopesticide adsorption onto relevant surfaces, including silica and cellulose. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and atomic force microscopy will characterize interfacial binding mechanisms, adsorption kinetics, and thermodynamic parameters under systematic variations of pH, temperature, ionic composition, and natural organic matter. These findings will inform the rational design of safer and more effective pesticide formulations by connecting molecular-scale architecture and thermodynamics with macroscale metrics. The integrated research and education activities will train students in advanced nanoscale characterization, computational modeling, and data analysis, thereby promoting workforce development in sustainable nanotechnology and agricultural science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both memory and storage have experienced technological advances driven by the rise of data-intensive applications such as data analytics and machine learning and improvements in hardware. However, the performance of the combined hardware devices and software systems that manage device access is limited by the information available to and from systems and storage devices. This research project aims to bridge the information gap between software systems and hardware devices by embedding implicit hints in its communication channel that exists between systems and devices. The project's novelties are (1) the idea of implicit hints on performance to be passed over the channel , and (2) its practical application for hardware-software optimizations. The project's broader significance and importance are (1) the improved sustainability and performance of computer systems and (2) the enhancement of workforce development and education pipeline for computer systems.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project focuses the memory and storage stack whose interfaces are narrow. The key insight is that for both memory and storage, translation layers exists both above and below the interfaces (physical memory address and logical block addresses, respectively) that allow hints to be passed while maintaining backward compatibility. The research objectives are achieved through three planned thrusts. First, it architects a flash memory-based solid-state drive that supports differentiated performance by balancing its various internal techniques and implementing the address remap command through learned indexing. Second, the project rethinks file system policies for implicit differentiation by revisiting block allocation, page cache, and file defragmentation. Lastly, the project creates a holistic memory management scheme for far memory by considering their interconnect topology and device performance characteristics. The resulting techniques will also drive innovative classroom lessons in computer systems for advancing our technological work force.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in improving network management, but existing ML models often fail when deployed outside controlled lab environments because they learn patterns that do not generalize well to real-world settings. This project develops a closed-loop ML pipeline that iteratively refines training data collection to improve model generalizability. By analyzing the decision-making process of ML models and identifying statistical biases in training data, the project hopes to ensure that ML-based network solutions are robust, effective, and suitable for deployment in diverse network environments.<br/><br/>Technically, the project introduces a new ML framework that continuously improves generalization by iteratively refining training datasets. The research efforts are divided into two main thrusts: (1) designing a programmable data-collection platform that enables flexible and scalable training data acquisition across different network environments, and (2) developing methodologies that use explainable ML techniques to detect and address underspecification issues in network models. The closed-loop approach ensures that ML models adapt over multiple iterations, mitigating learning shortcuts and spurious correlations that degrade performance in real-world settings. This project has significant broader impacts by enabling the development of generalizable ML models for networking, lowering the barrier to collecting high-quality training data, and fostering trust in ML-based network management solutions. By making it easier to curate datasets across diverse network environments, the project supports reproducible research and improves ML adoption in production networks, particularly for research and education (R&E) and last-mile community networks with constrained resources. <br/><br/>All project outcomes, including datasets, software, and model implementations, will be made publicly available at https://clml.cs.ucsb.edu/.

Worldwide, hypertension is one of the largest public health epidemics. Compared to ambulatory BP measurements, frequent out-of-clinic BP measurements are better predictors of cardiovascular events but, today, existing clinically-accurate technologies to measure BP require costly, uncomfortable, and cumbersome devices that prevent their extended use outside of the clinic. Given substantial healthcare and mortality burden of heart failure, rising healthcare costs, and the aging population, continued technological improvements to aid heart failure prevention, management, and surveillance are extremely important.  The goal of this project is to address this need for an accurate, inexpensive, easy-to use device for continuously monitoring BP through the development of a novel wearable watch built for this purpose.  This new technology will be a game-changer to protect at-risk individuals and effectively manage patients with hypertension proactively across the care continuum and reduce hospitalizations associated with hypertension. This study will also serve as fertile ground to support students in continuing their careers at the intersection of STEM and human oriented research.<br/><br/>One tool that is well-suited for unobtrusive BP monitoring is bioimpedance (BioZ). In BioZ, an imperceptible electrical current is passed through the body to obtain insights into how blood flows through arteries and veins. Here, the Investigators propose to develop new measurement methods rooted with fluid and electricity principles to create a new BioZ sensing technology capable of enabling continuous, cuffless, and convenient BP monitoring. For this, a novel aspect of the approach taken will be the application of BioZ in conjunction with physiological, computational, and machine learning models to establish the underlying biological sources at the cellular level relating both signals.   Once the models have been established and optimized to link BP to BioZ, the prediction accuracy will be evaluated in a cohort of individuals representative of a wide range of body indices and age groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Network theory is used to analyze applications ranging from economic development to business management. This project will develop new models and new measures of network structure that are tailored to particular outcomes of interest. The first project looks at how individuals learn from others, and asks what kinds of networks spread accurate information. The second project examines how businesses that share a supply chain make strategic decisions about pricing. The third project considers the economics of network coordination. When individuals seek to match their actions or opinions to those held by their friends and neighbors, what properties of the group determine whether or not disagreement will persist?  The fourth project studies the formation of networks for collaboration. The model gives new implications for how to build successful teams from diverse populations. This project includes experiments with students who will collaborate to learn new skills. The experiments are designed to measure key model parameters. The education component of this award uses the experiments as a platform for student engagement with recent research in this growing research field.<br/><br/>The proposal covers several of the major areas of the economic theory of networks: learning and information transmission, games and markets embedded in networks, and network formation. The first project analyzes a new model of rational individuals learning from their social contacts. It asks what network structures allow agents to form accurate beliefs about a changing world, and which ones lead to persistent errors. The second project studies a pricing problem in which firms interact strategically because they are part of the same supply chain and their prices affect each other's markets. The PI takes a network perspective on the strategic relationships and analyzes interventions in the market aimed, for example, at improving consumer welfare. The third project considers the basic welfare economics of network coordination. When individuals seek to match their actions or opinions to those of their network contacts, what properties of the group?s preferences determine the costs of miscoordination or disagreement? Which networks sustain strong polarization? The fourth project studies the formation of networks for collaboration, e.g. by students in school. Since the topics of the projects have proved to be of interest to applied researchers, the theoretical advances should have spillover benefits to other parts of economics. In several of the projects, a key aim is to provide empirically relevant summary statistics (e.g., measures of price pass-through, or segregation) for use in applied research. Finally,because the projects make connections with some classical problems of Bayesian learning, market power, and coordination games, they also aim to enrich economic theory more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To that end, the project focuses on transforming carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas, into value-added chemicals and fuels.  The novelty of the project lies in understanding the role of water in the electrochemical reactions that convert CO2 efficiently and selectively to multi-carbon hydrocarbon chemicals for use as building-blocks for a broad range of products including fuels, plastics, coatings, and construction products.  By varying the concentration of salt in a solution, the chemical activity of water (H2O) can be altered, potentially enabling greater control over the reaction of CO2 with H2O to produce the desired multi-carbon products.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project offers educational and training opportunities in STEM areas, especially focused on socioeconomically disadvantaged students.<br/>  <br/>The project investigates the role of H2O in modulating the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to favor efficient and selective formation of C2+ products.  Preliminary data from the investigator?s laboratory has shown that lowering the water activity favors the generation of multi-carbon products. By adjusting the salt concentrations within a range of 0.1 to > 10 molal in the water the investigators have successfully altered the activity of water in the solution, which, in turn, enhances the production of C2 products over their C1 counterparts. Three specific project thrusts will be pursued to understand the origin of improved electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2 or C2+ products with decreased water activity, namely: 1) optimize solution composition by simultaneously varying the cation, anion, and water activity for improved CO2-to-multicarbon fuels on Cu electrodes, 2) interrogate  the role of the electrolyte structure  in modulating catalysis with surface-enhanced in-situ infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS); and 3)  explore electrolyte engineering to boost CO2 reduction to multi-carbon alcohols on Cu-alloy catalysts.  Broader educational and outreach aspects of the project will introduce socioeconomically disadvantaged students to concepts of renewable energy research. Specifically, the investigator, along with a post-doctoral associate and undergraduate student, will participate in the Engineering Innovation Program (EIP) at Johns Hopkins University.  Students will conduct straightforward hands-on experiments to acquaint them with fundamental renewable energy concepts, with the goal of piquing their interest in STEM areas as related to educational and career paths supporting greenhouse gas reduction and mitigation of environmental impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although some marine invertebrates host only one or two types of microbes, others host thousands of different kinds of microbes. The project goal is to understand how and why particular microbes are hosted by invertebrates; whether the diversity of these microorganisms is related to the diversity of their hosts; and how these associations change over evolutionary time. The investigators are training graduate, undergraduate, and high school students how to assess microbiome diversity; how to use novel software to search, categorize, and compile data from DNA sequence archives; and how to identify and classify marine invertebrates. They are integrating graduate students and undergraduate students in the development of a high-school-based program to mentor students in the assessment of marine invertebrate biodiversity, training the next generation of scientists in invertebrate biology, host-microbe ecology, and evolutionary data analyses. In addition, research scientists are being trained to use novel data mining and compilation software to address unexplored questions in host-microbe evolution.<br/><br/>This project is investigating three ecological and evolutionary processes that structure the biodiversity of microbiomes: assembly, diversification, and coevolution. While previous studies have focused on the host-specificity of microbiomes, the project shifts the perspective from host evolution to microbial evolution. The project is developing models of host-symbiont interactions that function across multiple spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. By incorporating theories from evolutionary ecology and metacommunity ecology, the investigators are assessing the relative importance of environmental filtering, host-associated selection pressures, spatial connectivity, microbial competition, cospeciation, and host switching on the assembly of microbiomes. Through the use of phylogenetic comparative methods, the project is testing whether different clades of symbionts and clades of hosts respond to these forces differently. The investigators are examining how microbiomes both impact and respond to the process of host speciation in sympatry and allopatry. To accomplish these goals, novel software and evolutionary models are being developed to support large-scale analyses of microbial diversification and colonization of eukaryotic hosts.  These models are being experimentally tested by using a replicated series of settlement structures to examine the assembly of sessile marine invertebrate communities and the assembly of their associated microbiomes. In addition, marine sponges are being used as model organisms to contrast allopatric and sympatric microbiome divergence over evolutionary time. These investigations are enhancing our broader understanding of the roles of microbiomes in sustaining biodiversity.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Understanding the Rules of Life: Microbiome Theory and Mechanisms Program, administered as part of NSF's Ten Big Ideas through the Division of Emerging Frontiers in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While achieving impact, these solutions have the potential to miss the hundreds of departments and institutions that do not have access to these same resources. Further, the field?s focus on specific barriers has overshadowed existing change approaches among educators in resource-limited contexts. The stories of these educators are rarely amplified, even though they present an opportunity to explore alternative approaches to change and understand the specific strategic actions these individuals take to impact change. With that in mind, this CAREER project aims to develop visible examples of alternative approaches to curricular transformation and co-design interventions (e.g., workshops, activities, resources) that will be led and disseminated by engineering educators in their own departmental, institutional, and disciplinary communities. By examining and making visible these alternative approaches, this work will complement and work synergistically with the existing research examining barriers to educational change, large-scale collaborative change efforts, and engineering education faculty development. Overall, the results of this CAREER project will advance knowledge by articulating the individual, structural and cultural supports and barriers for impacting course and curricular transformation that can be used by faculty and graduate student developers, administrators, and funding agencies.<br/><br/>This CAREER award will leverage the positive deviance approach, which is an asset-based and participatory approach to change. The three-phase integrated research and education plan builds on the core tenants of the approach: a recognition that solutions already exist within the engineering education community, partnerships with community members to discover possible solutions, and a central focus on assets (as opposed to barriers and constraints). In particular, the research plan is grounded in theories of professional agency and designed to co-construct an understanding of how to foster agency toward curricular change by exploring the experiences and pathways of engineering educators who have overcome pedagogical inertia. In the first phase, a survey of engineering educators will provide a foundational understanding of the distinguishing and unifying characteristics among faculty pursuing curricular transformation. From the results of this survey, educators that have successfully developed transformational curricular designs while facing barriers that have impeded change in other contexts (a.k.a., positive deviants) will be recruited for participation in Phase 2a. Phase 2a will be focused on a multiple case study examining three data sources (i.e., in-depth interviews, observations of course sessions, and curricular-change-related documents). These data sources will be analyzed using narrative analysis methodologies to create in-depth change stories of these educators (n=12-15). The research and education plans will be integrated within Phase 2b through a collaborative inquiry of engineering educators (n=8-12) who want to pursue curricular transformation work. The outcomes of this collaborative inquiry will be community validation of the change stories and educator-led dissemination and propagation activity designs. The educator participants will lead the dissemination of these activities to their disciplinary, departmental, and institutional communities. The final phase captures the education plan and will include activities each year of the project. This third phase will seek to make change visible by developing a professional learning framework for courses and workshops on educational change, enabling educator-led dissemination to their communities, and amplifying the change stories of the positive deviants through multiple mediums.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to develop new methods that enable robots to better understand and respond to these nuanced safety challenges. The project intends to advance scientific knowledge and contribute to national well-being by making robots more trustworthy and effective in a wide range of settings, from personal homes to public and professional spaces. Additionally, the project will support robotics education through the following initiatives: i) Developing a ?Robotics Red-Teaming Challenge,? where college students will design and stress-test robot safety algorithms; ii) Engaging K-12 students in hands-on experiences with robot programming and troubleshooting; iii) Collaborating with government and industry stakeholders to establish safety benchmarks and promote the broader adoption of safe robotics practices.<br/><br/>This project will develop an algorithmic framework to align a robot?s understanding of safety with that of human stakeholders. The approach builds on foundational methods in safe control, which characterize safety constraints as arbitrary sets in state space. While this mathematical model is theoretically highly expressive, its practical application has been limited to controlled, collision-avoidance scenarios. This award supports fundamental research to generalize this framework to more nuanced safety specifications by embedding learned patterns about the real world, inferred from robot and human data. Research conducted under this grant will strive to enable robots to: i) Automatically assess the trustworthiness of their learned models of human behavior and react accordingly; ii) Update their internal safety representations using online human feedback, such as language; iii) Generalize their safety policies to account for uncertainty and learned latent state spaces. These advancements will be evaluated through hardware experiments, where robot arms and mobile manipulators will be deployed in unstructured environments, such as kitchen and atrium settings. In addition to these research objectives, the project includes a robust education and outreach plan to teach the next generation a nuanced yet practical perspective on robot safety. This will emphasize the often subtle and unanticipated consequences of robot interactions in real-world contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A data science-based framework is developed to enable learning, predicting, and simulating hard-to-model nanoscale fabrication processes, which underpin a variety of emerging applications in electronics, energy storage, and biomedicine. The project resonates with the global quest towards realizing the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning in boosting American competitiveness in advanced manufacturing. The scientific community benefits from this research by extending the approach to a broader set of nanoscale material systems including different oxide-supported metal nanoparticles. The team studies the evolution of alumina-supported iron nanoparticles which serve as nanocatalysts for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) for next generation thermal interfaces and electrical interconnects. The educational impact includes upskilling STEM students and junior scientists on timely topics at the nexus of data and manufacturing sciences. Moreover, the project generates jargon-free outreach materials explaining topics in machine learning and advanced nanomanufacturing to the general audience. <br/><br/>The collective behavior and interactions among substrate-bound nanoparticles during the coupled physicochemical processes of oxidation/reduction, dewetting, coarsening, and catalysis are not well understood. This severely constrains the ability to reliably manufacture dense populations (hundreds of billions per square centimeter) of functional nanoparticles or active nanocatalysts. This project combines probabilistic data science methods with in-situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) to elucidate the dynamics of spatial proximity effects among ensembles of adjacent nanoparticles. The research is to leverage spatio-temporal point process theory, a branch of probabilistic machine learning, for quantifying, predicting, and simulating the time evolution of location and size distributions and spatial dependencies during the formation and evolution of metal nanoparticles from thin films. In pursuit of this research, the following tasks are performed: (1) In-situ E-TEM measurements of population behavior of metal oxide reduction, nanoparticle formation by dewetting, coarsening by Ostwald ripening, and catalytic activation; (2) Automated image segmentation of in-situ E-TEM videos to extract salient information about the time evolution of locations, sizes, areal densities, shapes and activation of nanoparticles; (3) Learning from experimental observations: Spatio-temporal statistical modeling of segmentation data using point process theory to characterize, predict, and simulate the evolution of interaction potentials; (4) Learning beyond experimental constraints: Elucidating the physicochemical dynamics of metal/support interfacial phenomena for larger spatial domains, finer temporal resolutions, and unsampled conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is mainly due to the practice of the building industry, i.e., the compliance of those guidelines mainly focuses on design and construction requirements whereas the actual experience of wheelchair users is not fully investigated after the construction phase. One viable solution is to acquire and utilize the data from the community with disabilities on how they use wheelchairs to navigate and experience buildings. In this project, three main activities will be conducted. First, a community meeting will be prepared and executed to understand the environmental experience and stressors that wheelchair users experience in their daily environment. Based on the foundational knowledge of their environmental stressors, the research team will further develop WheelComV2 to acquire thermal stress of wheelchair users via non-intrusive sensing of chair monitoring. Finally, we will pilot our technological approach together with the community of local citizens who use wheelchairs. Ultimately, the proposed approach will enable them to be citizen scientists, leading to the disability-centric evaluation process to improve the physical accessibility of the built environment.<br/><br/>The proposed research will establish the new field of disability-centric building accessibility evaluation, which aims at discovering the fundamental knowledge of human (with disability) and building interaction. In the field of human-building interaction, building scientists have used the concept of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) to quantify occupants? environmental comfort (or more often stress) in buildings. However, none of these building IEQ guidelines are tailored for occupants with disabilities (e.g., people who use wheelchairs). Our disability-led research activities will define the environmental stress of wheelchair users, which we often naively assume from ambulatory occupants. Furthermore, our development of WheelComV2 will test the research hypothesis, i.e., the detection of irregular patterns in temporal data stream of wheelchair movement monitoring is indicative of wheelchair user?s thermal discomfort. The newly gained insight on our experiment will provide a foundational technological basis to develop non-intrusive sensing approach to better understand the experience of people who use wheelchairs in buildings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transitions between mutualism and parasitism have evolved often. However, little is known about the biology of organisms that have undergone these transitions. Understanding this important evolutionary transition has important ramifications for medicine, agriculture, and epidemiology. This project supports research by four master?s students studying the biology of one group of insects (leafflower moths) that have evolved from mutualistic to parasitic relationships with their host plants. Student projects will study the genetics of these moths in Texas and the southeastern United States. They will also explore the diversity of bacteria associated with these moths? caterpillars, and the biology of moths in this genus that were just discovered in Puerto Rico. Students will also train with external collaborators, and travel to a scientific conference to present their findings. The University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and the largest university in the Permian Basin of West Texas, with a student population that is majority-first generation college students. This project will also fund summer research experiences for five undergraduates (four from UTPB, one from the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus), and for a group of UTPB undergraduates to attend a national scientific meeting in summer 2023.<br/><br/>Transitions between mutualism and parasitism have occurred frequently throughout the Tree of Life. This proposal outlines research on the evolution and ecology of a brood pollination mutualism between leafflower plants in the family Phyllanthaceae and leafflower moths in the genus Epicephala. Interestingly, this mutualism has repeatedly broken down into parasitism. This research will gather the first data on the ways in which these parasites? population structure evolves in response to their host diversity. It will also study the macroevolution of mutualism gain and loss in an unstudied tropical North American radiation of these plants and insects. Finally, the work will provide data on the way in which third party associates (larval microbiomes) vary with the mutualism-parasitism transition and shifts among host plant lineages. Results from this research will be readily interpreted in the context of previous work on the biology of the mutualistic congeners of these parasites in Asia and the Pacific.

This project aims to develop artificial touch that feels natural and is easy to use for people with bionic arms. This natural feeling will be created through pulsed electrical stimulation that mimics the natural nerve signals in the skin. By using low-cost electrodes on the skin surface, this technology can be more easily commercialized and integrated with prosthetic arms, unlike technologies that require surgical implantation. Additionally, this project supports a collaboration between a primarily undergraduate institution and a major research university, allowing undergraduate students to engage in high-impact research to enhance their education and career opportunities while at the same time exposing graduate students to potential careers at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>Noninvasive neurostimulation to restore touch often feels electrical, unnatural and unpleasant. This proposal develops novel biomimetic electrocutaneous (EC) stimulation algorithms to enhance the naturalness of sensations and improve functional performance and reduce cognitive load during closed-loop sensorimotor tasks (e.g., fragile object manipulation). To create natural feeling sensory percepts, several obstacles unique to noninvasive EC stimuli need to be overcome. Because pulse frequencies above 50 Hz feel more natural but higher pulse frequencies are less able to convey a change in stimulus strength, frequency modulation alone reduces the range of perceived intensities. However, variations in electrical conductivity and build-up of electric charge at the electrode-skin interface can create unpleasant and painful sensations. Therefore, this research explores novel multi-modal biomimetic stimulation paradigms designed to avoid activation of pain or itch nerve fibers while also providing a useful range of stimulation intensity. Individuals with transradial amputation will be recruited at both a primarily undergraduate institution and an R1 research university to test the biomimetic EC stimulation algorithms while controlling bionic arms with electromyographic signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrochemical processing of bio-feedstocks to high-value chemical products is challenging, however.  This project will prove a novel concept for electrocatalytically converting bio-resourced carboxylic acids to alcohols, creating an opportunity for reduced carbon emissions relative to current technology.  The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students and educational initiatives for students, scientists, and non-expert community members.  A research experience for local community college instructors will be offered to help them shape future curricula and guide students in continuing from two-year to four-year degree programs.<br/>  <br/>The project explores the hypothesis that electrochemically-generated surface hydride can cooperate with Lewis acid catalysts to selectively reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols, imitating the mechanism of harsh chemical reagents such as aluminum hydride. The proposed systems bear similarity to so-called ?frustrated? Lewis pairs, which can activate hydrogen heterolytically and reduce challenging bonds.  These concepts will be investigated in the context of synthesizing 1,2-propanediol (propylene glycol), a major commodity and outlet for propylene, using bio-derived lactic acid.  To that end, the project bridges gaps between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with the design of molecular-catalyst-like surfaces, and will delineate fundamental requirements for harnessing strong acidity and hydricity to activate difficult bonds. Controlling these properties simultaneously is a grand challenge as they are intrinsically at odds and require sophisticated schemes to avoid reactivity quenching. The project also will explore new mechanisms to mimic the activity of strong reagents with electrochemical driving forces.  It will further expand basic understanding of phenomena such as proton transfer and pH in non-aqueous environments and develop approaches to rigorous benchmarking of novel materials that lack established protocols. Fundamental requirements will be examined in non-aqueous electrolytes with hydrogen as the dominant hydride precursor, while further work will aim to translate the chemistry to more desirable aqueous conditions.  In a similar vein, initial studies will combine heterogeneous hydride generation with homogeneous Lewis-acid electrolytes and then move to full ?heterogenization? with solid acid/metal interfacial catalysts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, advanced methods will be employed to explore the rich data generated by the open-road testbeds. The implementation of hybrid reinforcement learning strategies will facilitate real-time interactions of deployed controllers, enhancing design efficiency. Validation of the controllers will occur through extensive testing with vehicles on the open road, using the I-24 MOTION framework to ensure practical reliability and safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop artificial touch that feels natural and is easy to use for people with bionic arms. This natural feeling will be created through pulsed electrical stimulation that mimics the natural nerve signals in the skin. By using low-cost electrodes on the skin surface, this technology can be more easily commercialized and integrated with prosthetic arms, unlike technologies that require surgical implantation. Additionally, this project supports a collaboration between a primarily undergraduate institution and a major research university, allowing undergraduate students to engage in high-impact research to enhance their education and career opportunities while at the same time exposing graduate students to potential careers at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>Noninvasive neurostimulation to restore touch often feels electrical, unnatural and unpleasant. This proposal develops novel biomimetic electrocutaneous (EC) stimulation algorithms to enhance the naturalness of sensations and improve functional performance and reduce cognitive load during closed-loop sensorimotor tasks (e.g., fragile object manipulation). To create natural feeling sensory percepts, several obstacles unique to noninvasive EC stimuli need to be overcome. Because pulse frequencies above 50 Hz feel more natural but higher pulse frequencies are less able to convey a change in stimulus strength, frequency modulation alone reduces the range of perceived intensities. However, variations in electrical conductivity and build-up of electric charge at the electrode-skin interface can create unpleasant and painful sensations. Therefore, this research explores novel multi-modal biomimetic stimulation paradigms designed to avoid activation of pain or itch nerve fibers while also providing a useful range of stimulation intensity. Individuals with transradial amputation will be recruited at both a primarily undergraduate institution and an R1 research university to test the biomimetic EC stimulation algorithms while controlling bionic arms with electromyographic signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will design and implement a novel container-based approach for sharing and reproducing scientific results. Reproducible containers developed from this project will package code, data, environment, provenance, and assumptions across heterogeneous computing platforms. In contrast to taking a ""devops""-based approach, which burdens the user to manage reproducibility of experiments, this project uses reference executions of scientific experiments as a virtualization method for containerizing associated artifacts. <br/><br/>While a container-based approach can help to verify repeat computations, further advancements in container technology are needed to enable advanced forms of reproducibility. This project aims to enable reproducibility even if computations include non-determinism and race conditions; code, data-sets, and parameters are changed; computations are performed on distributed platforms; and containers are shared with sensitive data and undocumented content. To that end, the project will develop an open-source container runtime that will offer primitives for enabling re-runnability, extensibility, and publish-ability of containers.  The work leverages portable containers developed previously for computational sciences. This award will lay the foundation for an essential building block for establishing reproducibility of real-world computational and data science use cases.

The methodology ensuing from the project will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities via publications, conference and seminar presentations, and the development of open-source software. The project will involve multiple research mentoring initiatives, including efforts on broadening participation, and will offer advanced topic courses to introduce the state-of-the-art techniques in time series analysis.

Recently, the SN technique has been advanced to the inference of high-dimensional time series, but it requires the use of a trimming parameter. Also, its scope of applicability is limited to high-dimensional time series with weak panel dependence which might be unrealistic in many modern time series applications. In turn, the existing SN for functional time series relies on dimension reduction by functional principal component analysis and, hence, the resulting procedure may be powerless when the alternative is orthogonal to the space spanned by the top principal components used in the procedure. To address these major limitations, this project will develop a new unified framework based on SS-SN, in conjunction with inference for multivariate and functional time series, and investigate its utility in application to analysis of time series of low, medium, high or infinite dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, one third of U.S. counties suffer from severe drought, causing losses of more than $30 billion/year to U.S. irrigated farms. In-situ soil monitoring in crop fields to enable efficient irrigation practices is an important water management strategy. Nevertheless, only 12% of irrigated farms in the U.S. have deployed soil sensors due to limitations of current technologies, which are unable to infer field-wide soil conditions from local sensor measurements. There are also challenges in using soil monitoring to improve irrigation scheduling.  This project will advance the fundamental science underlying strategies to capture field-scale soil moisture and salinity data to optimize soil monitoring and irrigation control. The success of the project will make sensor-based digital agriculture attractive and economically viable for farmers, which will help strengthen the national security of food and water resources. The project will also help build research capabilities at Oklahoma State University in scientific computing, artificial intelligence, digital agriculture, and sustainability. It will provide opportunities for students to conduct STEM research. In addition, educational and outreach programs will raise awareness and broaden participation of engineering students, farmers, and local communities in digital and sustainable farming, thus helping prepare the next-generation workforce to adopt digital solutions and systems thinking in the food and agriculture sectors.<br/><br/>This project develops a data-driven, physics-augmented digital twin to address whether and how field-wide soil moisture and salinity profiles can be attained by a small number of strategically placed sensors, and explores how to leverage these profiles to design efficient crop irrigation systems.

It will accelerate research by enabling the advanced manufacturing of tiny devices and machines, fostering new ideas in biology, medicine, physics, and engineering, and furthering national priorities in these areas. To build new knowledge of both natural and engineered systems at the molecular and cellular scales, researchers need to manufacture tools that can interface directly with these systems. Traditional additive manufacturing (or ""3D printing"") can create arbitrarily shaped objects based on computer models, but most existing printers have limited resolution and are unable to fabricate extremely small and complex structures. This award enables the acquisition of a 3D printer that uses a precision laser beam to print objects from a variety of plastic materials, with feature sizes smaller than human cells. These capabilities will allow researchers to probe cell and tissue behaviors, better understand diseases, enhance chemical reactions, explore the optical, electronic, and thermal properties of materials, and create novel devices and microrobots. The discoveries made will have applications in energy, healthcare, environmental science, and materials science, with the potential to benefit society and the U.S. economy for years to come. As a unique manufacturing resource in the Midwest, this advanced 3D printer will also inform engineering education, including increasing the participation of students in technical disciplines, through its incorporation into training, workshops, and outreach activities to the regional academic community and K-12 students.<br/><br/>Among the tools capable of achieving submicron feature resolution, conventional semiconductor processing typically yields ""flat"" topographies. The resolution of even the best conventional 3D printers is two orders of magnitude larger than what is needed to interface with microscopic structures. Two-photon polymerization laser lithography enables rapid prototyping and wafer-scale production of 3D structures with submicron precision. This technology uses a lower-energy near-infrared laser to solidify the printing material only when photoresin molecules simultaneously absorb the energy of two photons. This 3D printer will create structures ranging from nanometer to millimeter scales across centimeter-sized areas. The diverse research team will (i) fabricate micro-/nanophotonic integrated circuits and optical devices, (ii) explore the fundamental mechanobiology of cells and tissues, (iii) develop stretchable electronics for sensing and measurement, (iv) discover new phenomena in atomically thin materials, and (v) probe the behavior of microswimmers using cell-scale acoustofluidic actuators, among other programs in device physics, transport phenomena, and biology/medicine.

Significant research over the last three decades has brought the extreme nature of these events into focus. But controls on the nature and tempo of recovery after these catastrophic events remain unknown, despite implications for potential climate system tipping points. In particular, unexpectedly protracted periods of warm climate and delayed environmental and biological recovery following some Large Igneous Provinces underscore a fundamental lack of understanding of the gases released during the waning stages of these events and/or controls on global climate. This project will carry out a multi-disciplinary effort combining field observations; high-resolution records of volcanism, climate, weathering, and life; and numerical modeling to understand co-evolution of solid and surface Earth during perturbation and recovery. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.  This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences to support AI/ML advancement in the geosciences.<br/><br/>This project addresses a fundamental unanswered question: what processes shape climate and biotic recovery from major Large Igneous Province-driven carbon cycle perturbations? The project aims to test the new overarching hypothesis that a large-scale transition in crustal rheology shuts down Large Igneous Province volcanism, but continued mantle melting drives cryptic Carbon Dioxide release and delays climate and biotic recovery.  If correct, this hypothesis implies that cryptic degassing?Carbon Dioxide release through the crust decoupled from eruption rates?is a key, and previously unaccounted for, control on the climatic conditions and tempo characterizing recovery. To test this hypothesis, this project pursues four key scientific objectives: 1) development of high-resolution, multi-disciplinary records of volcanism and weathering, 2) coupling of models of mantle geodynamics, magma transport, and outgassing, 3) assimilation of records of past climate and weathering into climate-biogeochemical modeling to invert for outgassing fluxes and place top-down constraints on interior evolution, 4) integration of paleobiological databases with records and modeling of volcanism, climate and weathering to test factors shaping which types of organisms thrive beyond recovery. The project leverages three powerful natural laboratory Large Igneous Provinces and climate events, building from the youngest and best-resolved, the Columbia River Basalts and Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum; to the more voluminous North Atlantic Igneous Province, Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum; and finally to the Siberian Traps, catastrophic end-Permian mass extinction, and early Triassic hothouse. The project will carry out a sustained outreach/inreach effort in northeastern Oregon, the epicenter of Columbia River Basalt volcanism and site of project field work. Activities aim to humanize science and enhance education through engagement of rural communities. Project PIs and students will engage school-age children in Oregon and New Jersey, and global Large Igneous Province researchers through: a data portal and set of virtual field trips; Large Igneous Provinces for Kids programming in the form of visits to Wallowa county schools and ?Write a Scientist? correspondences with project scientists; and a field forum at the mid-point of the project that will welcome the Large Igneous Province community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The United States considers 50 mineral commodities as ?critical minerals? that are essential to the national economy and safety. The United States relies heavily on imports for 43 out of the 50 critical minerals, which means strengthening domestic supply chains for these minerals is a pressing need. This requires a multidisciplinary approach including mineral exploration, material flow analysis, mining and mineral processing practices, metallurgy, policy making, supply chain economics, sustainability, reclamation, and workforce development. This award provides partial support for the North American Workshop on Critical Mineral Research, Development and Education to be held August 13-14, 2025 at the University of Texas at Austin. Participants will include stakeholders from academia, the private sector and government agencies. They will discuss conventional and unconventional resources of critical minerals from multidisciplinary perspectives, including mineral exploration, resource and reserve evaluation, mineral processing and recycling, policy making, supply chain economics, workforce development, and artificial intelligence and machine learning in critical mineral research and development. International leaders will give keynote presentations on the current state of knowledge, highlighting potential strategies to address critical mineral research, development, and education. Presentations by participants, poster sessions, and breakout sessions will facilitate discussions of additional concepts and perspectives. It is anticipated that the workshop will serve as a long-term platform for the budding critical mineral community in the USA and will nurture relationships among participants from academia, government agencies and the private sector ? thus facilitating multi-disciplinary collaborations with the goal of strengthening U.S. critical mineral supply chains.<br/><br/>The workshop will provide a truly multidisciplinary platform to discuss critical mineral research, development and education from different perspectives. Sessions will be structured around pressing research needs in several areas, including mineral resources, mineral processing and recycling technologies, policy making, supply chain economics, and pathways towards growing the U.S. critical mineral workforce. The workshop committee will prepare a comprehensive multidisciplinary report that that will summarize the workshop discussions and can be used to inform decision-making in pursuit of strengthening U.S. critical mineral supply chains. The hybrid in-person/virtual workshop will nurture the budding national critical mineral community by providing a multidisciplinary discussion platform for participants from academia, the private sector, and government agencies. Travel grants, primarily for students and early-career researchers, will help build a community that spans generations and ensure the meeting?s lasting impact. The development of a healthy and active critical mineral community is pivotal to the national safety and economy because the United States remains import-reliant for most commodities on the critical minerals list. The workshop?s breakout sessions are designed to foster networking between stakeholders from a wide spectrum of disciplines who otherwise rarely interact. To ensure an impact beyond the dates of the workshop, the workshop activities will be used to help start research and educational collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These flows are defined on manifolds equipped with a metric, that is to say, a way of measuring distance. A Ricci flow is a geometric partial differential equation for Riemannian metrics. The Ricci flow tends to evolve an initial metric into a more homogeneous one. The singularity analysis of Ricci flow is a central subject, as it helps to understand the geometry and topology of manifolds. The most remarkable application in this direction is the resolution of the Poincare conjecture and the Geometrization conjecture by Perelman. Many of the Ricci flow singularity models are Ricci solitons. Recent examples of solitons constructed by the PI look like flying wings. The PI will study the geometry of all 3-dimensional steady Ricci solitons and try to classify them by their asymptotic limits. In addition, the PI will study the higher-dimensional steady Ricci solitons and see if they can arise as singularity models.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The research project is split into two projects. The first project is to prove the O(2)-symmetry of all 3-dimensional steady Ricci solitons. This includes showing that the Bryant soliton is the unique 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton that is asymptotic to a ray. This extends a previous result of the PI in which one assumes the O(2)-symmetry of the soliton. The PI developed some methods that may be extended to the more general class of ancient collapsed Ricci flows in dimension 3. In particular, the PI will investigate the symmetry of the ancient collapsed Ricci flows in dimension 3 and aim at classifying them by certain 2-dimensional limits. The second project is a continuation of the PI's work on the existence theory of Ricci flows coming out of non-compact initial manifolds. The PI will investigate the applications of non-compact Ricci flows in topology and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite high rates of international enrollment and an increased focus on global dimensions of engineering in US programs, ethical issues arising from global engineering have been insufficiently addressed. To address these issues, this project will assess the impact of culture and education on ethics among engineering students in North America, Europe, and Asia. Understanding if and how diverse cultural backgrounds and educational experiences affect professional decision-making and collaborations requires empirical investigation, to develop training that addresses the kinds of challenges engineering students, practitioners, programs, and organizations will increasingly encounter in the globalized world. This project will be beneficial for training the next generation of engineers who are competent in working professionally and ethically in the global context and are responsive to the value of diversity in quality and sustainable engineering work.   <br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to identify educational interventions with the greatest effects on ethical reasoning and dispositions of engineering students, whether these effects differ among cultural and national groups, and if/how to modify these interventions to respond effectively to cultural and national differences. To do so, researchers from Colorado School of Mines, University of Pittsburgh, Delft University of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University will implement mixed-method, quasi-experimental, longitudinal, and cross-sectional research to: (1) determine the effects of culture and foreign language on the ethical perspectives of first-year engineering students; (2) assess the relative effects of culture and education on these perspectives over four years; (3) use engineering ethics assessment tools across cultures and countries to examine their cross-cultural validity. Findings from this project will be essential to develop educational interventions that effectively respond to the globalized environments of contemporary engineering practice. They will also contribute to the development of more inclusive engineering education, by identifying perspectives potentially marginalized in the reigning paradigms. Finally, this project has implications for the development of responsible research education at the graduate level. Despite the fact graduate student bodies in STEM fields have become increasingly international, limited work has focused on developing culturally responsive ethics curricula for graduate students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses the experimental bottleneck that exists in unambiguously proving, or refuting, hypotheses about quantum effects in living systems. The Instrumentation for Quantum Biology Research Coordination Network (I-QuBio RCN) will bring together a diverse community of scientists from around the world to collaborate on method development for the field known as ?Quantum Biology?. Quantum Biology is a frontier scientific effort, requiring a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers who can communicate across scientific boundaries. Through hybrid in-person/online workshops and training schools, this network will provide quantum biology practitioners with community to discuss and advance the experimental infrastructure required to advance the field within the near future. <br/><br/>The I-QUB RCN will increase the connectivity of the nascent community on Quantum Biology across several axes: geography; cross-disciplinarity; integration between experiment and theory; research across different scales ranging from molecules to whole organisms; and career stages, with an emphasis in training and integrating a young workforce of Quantum Biology researchers. The aim is to enable better measurement, through the tools of quantum mechanics and apply them to precision measurement of biological phenomena.

Furthermore, cellular networks have not been designed for mission-critical communications and have exposed several security vulnerabilities. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) faces challenges in using commercial off-the-shelf 5G products and commercial networks for US military operations. The Zero Trust X (ZTX) team, a consortium of interdisciplinary experts in the field of 5G and security, will research and develop a family of security solutions to establish a Zero Trust Chain (ZTC) that enables end-to-end security and protection for reliable use of 5G networks for DoD use cases. The proposed effort will generate knowledge and research outcomes tailored for use by US industry and DoD. Additionally, the project will train a diverse team of students in research and provide open-source software that facilitates portability, reproducibility, and integration with other Track G solutions of this program.<br/><br/><br/>The project's specific goal is to develop the ZTC software that enables military squads to securely share situational awareness in their operations using high-performance, yet often untrusted, 5G networks. The software solution leverages the flexibility of the 5G standard and implements innovative security solutions at different network nodes and layers to empower DoD operators to detect malicious entities in near-real time and establish communication mechanisms to prevent access to or control over DoD traffic. Specifically, through minimal cooperation with 5G network operators, part of the ZTC solution leverages Open-RAN (O-RAN) and 5G core-centric approaches for practical threat monitoring and mitigation. This is complemented by device-centric security enhancements to ensure that DoD devices also implement their own layer of security and do not solely depend on the security protocols of the network provider. Six key features set ZTC apart from other solutions: (i) it builds on the Open Artificial Intelligence Cellular (OAIC) platform for developing O-RAN threat monitoring and mitigation through RAN Intelligent Controllers; (ii) it offers end-to-end secure slicing across the 5G RAN and Core; (iii) it detects threats at user devices in near-real time; (iv) it protects communication through innovation at the application layer rather than modifying existing 5G physical layer protocols and algorithms; (v) it ensures location privacy and resiliency to unknown/unanticipated denial of service (DoS) attacks; and (vi) it does not require modifications to public 5G/O-RAN networks and standards, and only requires installation of low-overhead software modules on 5G user devices and cooperative 5G networks. The ZTX team's work is applicable to commercial and military 5G communication networks and to O-RAN. The ZTX team will implement and experimentally evaluate the proposed ZTC initially on a laboratory-scale integrated 5G/O-RAN testbed, and subsequently on other available testbeds to prepare for commercial transition. The team will apply Convergence Accelerator fundamentals to foster partnerships and to develop a sustainability model with an impact extending well beyond Phase 2 of the program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the existing software tools for this purpose may need hours or days to align such large amount of DNA sequence data even with very powerful computing systems of today due to the 'memory wall' challenge in state-of-the-art computing architecture that describes the speed mismatch between memory units and computing units. To this end this, project leverages innovations from non-volatile nano-magnet based Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology and in-memory computing architecture. If successful, it can achieve up to two orders magnitude higher computing performance, speed and energy efficiency for next-generation DNA sequence analysis system, which enables large-scale fast genomic data analytics to support research on various disease studies and biomedical applications.

Therefore, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to develop a breakthrough computational framework that can mimic realistic brain-muscle activation dynamics and support discovering fundamental knowledge about TBI mechanics and associated interventions. This research requires methods and knowledge from various disciplines, including neuroscience, biomechanics, human factors, and control engineering, thus impacting the convergence of engineering and medicine. The project?s synergistic education and outreach activities outline a plan to strengthen the interdisciplinary field of neuro-biomechanics in bioengineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering through course development, involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research activities, and K-12 outreach activities. In addition, the outreach through webinars and video blogging will enhance scientific literacy levels about TBI among broad audiences, including first responders and TBI patients.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term goal is to discover the fundamental relationship between brain multiphysics and neuromuscular dynamics in order to develop engineering technologies (i.e., helmet technologies, neuroprosthetics, etc.) and therapeutic interventions (e.g., TBI-focused rehabilitation, surgical treatments, etc.) to reduce TBI in sports, workplaces, and daily activities. In pursuit of this vision, this project will provide a Brain-Muscle-Interaction framework, called BMI-frame, a closed-loop framework composed of multiscale brain neuronal models, head-neck finite-element (FE) structures, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithms, and neural network (NN) agents. This objective will be accomplished through three specific tasks: 1) investigate the effects of mechanical impacts on brain neuronal signals, 2) identify NN agents to predict brain and muscle PID gain parameters, and 3) characterize brain and muscle responses to mechanical impacts. Task 1 focuses on developing and validating brain electromechanical models to understand brain neuronal response to various (sub) traumatic impacts. Task 2 will explore novel NN algorithms in order to accurately tune brain signals and individual neck muscle activations with a minimal number of iterations and loop delays. Task 3 focuses on validating the BMI-frame platform by exploring the dynamics of brain-muscle interactions in response to various (sub) traumatic mechanical impacts and TBI conditions. The research is a breakthrough innovation as it transforms brain-muscle interaction dynamics into a mathematically-grounded engineering framework, with the purpose of creating unprecedented scientific knowledge about how (sub) traumatic mechanical impacts cause electromechanical disruptions of brain neuronal dynamics and, in turn, how brain neuronal disruptions affect neck muscle responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To understand the cause and patterns of spread of a disease outbreak that began in late summer of 2022 at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (northwest Gulf of Mexico, GoM), a team of ecologists, ocean connectivity and disease modelers, microbiologists, and coral immunologists (from Rice University, the University of Virgin Islands (UVI), Louisiana State University (LSU), and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) is monitoring the health of corals, and biopsy their tissues. This data aid in developing a model that predicts coral disease transmission and its impacts on economically valuable coral reefs in the GoM. This project supports multidisciplinary field and laboratory research experiences of graduate students at multiple minority-serving institutions, and provides undergraduate students with hands-on training in modeling, ecological and molecular analysis techniques. UVI and LSU are in EPSCoR jurisdictions and have diverse student bodies, including numerous under-represented minority (URM) students. The research team collaboratively provides URM students with research experiences in STEM fields. Project findings are being broadly communicated through virtual public programming, to the Disease Advisory Council, and via direct updates to managers of the Flower Garden Bank National Marine Sanctuary. <br/><br/>Over the last four decades, diseases decimated ecosystem engineers in marine coastal environments, including coral reefs. Recent results from studies of white plague and stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) show coral species immune traits can influence disease resistance and therefore predict of coral community structure post-outbreak in the Caribbean. In late August of 2022, an unidentified multi-species acute tissue loss disease with signs and species susceptibility characteristics reminiscent of white plague or SCTLD was documented at the Flower Garden Banks (northwest Gulf of Mexico, GoM). This disease is having significant impacts on FGB and could become widespread across the GoM, offering an opportunity to test hypotheses about the influence of coral community composition and pathogen dispersal on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak; few studies examine this on relatively isolated, deep, coral-dense reefs. The interdisciplinary research team employs photomosaics and colony fate-tracking, layered molecular datasets and microscopy approaches, as well as modeling of disease reservoirs and dispersal to assess the etiology of the disease and contribute to the development of a generalizable framework for  disease spread on reefs. By parsing the impacts of reef-scale community composition versus seascape-scale dispersal in disease transmission and persistence, this work helps reveal the potential resistance and resilience of isolated, coral-dense reefs to diseases that decimate these ecosystems across the wider Caribbean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adaptive social learning, however, only works when people accurately sense others? thoughts and actions. Unfortunately, mounting evidence shows large, systematic and persistent errors in perceptions about the beliefs and actions of others. In particular, people most dramatically underestimate others? climate concerns and willingness to act. These underestimates can stifle civic engagement, productive dialogue, policy support, and collective action by the general public, and discourage responses from elected officials, who respond to what they see as their constituents? priorities. This research develops a framework to better understand why people have mispreceptions and what methods can improve the accuracy of perceptions. Closing this gap can encourage public and private actors to take steps towards addressing climate change. Furthermore, understanding the causes of persistent social misperceptions is relevant for a broad range of problems. By studying a fundamental cognitive challenge for collective action, this research contributes to scholarship on opinion formation and supports the development of communication strategies that take into account humankind?s social nature to more effectively mobilize climate action.<br/> <br/>Addressing collective action problems such as climate change requires individuals to engage in a host of coordinated behaviors to effect widespread systemic changes. Recent work suggests that individuals are more likely to take action when they believe that others share their concerns and desire for action. Yet, while most people are concerned about climate change, they systematically underestimate others? concern, which can inhibit action toward addressing collective challenges. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this project uses cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs across multiple samples to develop and test an integrative framework illuminating drivers of pervasive social misperceptions and pathways for correcting these biases. The proposed studies progress in three phases: 1) identifying and testing plausible explanations for social misperceptions; 2) developing and comparing methods for correcting misperceptions; and 3) testing interventions in high-impact and ecologically valid contexts, including with a sample of decision makers. The proposed research will advance the literatures in cognitive science, judgment and decision making, social psychology, and communications related to persistent and systematic misperceptions about collective norms. The research extends previous work by identifying and testing mechanisms by which misperceptions develop and persist and how they can be ameliorated, helping policymakers and educators tailor messages accordingly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tasks require different levels of steady grasp force and exert different sensations on the fingers and palm. This raises questions of how the brain regulates sustained grasp force and processes sensory input from different parts of the hand. This project will investigate cortical oscillations using high-density electrode grids while human subjects perform sustained hand grasp tasks and feel tactile stimuli such as touch and vibration. Novel computational algorithms will be developed and applied to the neural data to predict the produced grasp force and differentiate tactile inputs to the hand. This project will provide novel knowledge regarding the organization of sensorimotor cortex activity in relation to grasp force and tactile sensations. Brain regions that show unique activity in response to touch and vibration will then be stimulated with electrical pulses to elicit artificial sensations. Insights gained from this project will play a critical role in the development of closed-loop neuroprosthetics that can replicate natural hand function.<br/><br/>Despite considerable progress regarding our understanding of the neural bases of sensorimotor behavior, there is very limited knowledge about the neural dynamics of sensory and motor cortical circuits during the generation of sustained complex hand function, such as grasping and tactile exploration, which are essential for common daily activities. A better understanding of the spatio-temporal neural dynamics associated with sustained complex hand movements and somatosensory processing is a necessary requirement for the construction of more efficient closed-loop neuroprosthetics. Utilizing advanced electrode technology, this project will record cortical activity with high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) grids, then decode multichannel data with computational intelligence for the identification of oscillatory patterns of the sensorimotor cortex during the execution of sustained hand grasp function. The high-density ECoG grids will provide recordings of brain activity across a large cortical space and with sub-centimeter resolution. Simultaneously, tactile sensory inputs--such as vibration and touch--will be delivered to different fingers and palm. The project will examine to what extent the cortical oscillations can be used to predict the produced grasp force and distinguish between different prolonged somatosensory inputs to the hand. The project will also develop a real-time system for the mapping cortical activations online, then stimulate cortical regions using channel suites and temporal patterns mimicking the ECoG modulations using a computer-in-the-loop system. The project will integrate neuroscience, neurosurgery and biomedical engineering expertise, to uncover spatio-spectral dynamics of somatosensory and motor cortical oscillations, and decode these patterns for the control of closed-loop hand neuroprosthetics. Outcomes will enable the design and development of neuroprosthetics more akin to the natural function of the hand.<br/><br/>This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Biology (BIO), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To drive radical transformation of industry, factories must securely expand beyond their physical boundaries. These Future Factories (FF) consume and create interdisciplinary knowledge along with the ability to forge innovative technological transformations. This project introduces a novel future cyber-manufacturing paradigm ? the Factory-to-Factory (F2F) network framework. Geared towards automation, F2F networks require interoperability of stakeholders and efficient understanding systems for data, information, and knowledge. This collaboration between academia ? led by the University of South Carolina and West Virginia University - and industry will produce advanced smart manufacturing technologies and an educated upskilled workforce in SC and WV. Furthermore, it will create a blueprint model for future manufacturing technologies that can be integrated with a F2F network to increase small-scale and industrial manufacturing capabilities across the US. To expand our workforce infrastructure, we will establish a lifelong learning pipeline for smart manufacturing ranging from K-12 education, higher education, to professional development support for scholars and industrial professionals. Particularly, we will create online learning resources and STEM-oriented smart manufacturing summer programs for K-12 students and provide internships for college and graduate students through our industrial partners. <br/><br/>This project will adapt, enhance, and integrate informational technologies (IT) and operational technologies (OT) such as real-time secured sensing, high performance computing, wireless communications, and AI, to support process optimization among distributed smart manufacturing systems for F2F. Convergence and true progress can only be achieved by fusing expert knowledge of manufacturing processes with newly emerged hardware and software technologies. The project focuses on manufacturing knowledge stemming from: (1) autonomous feature extraction and recognition from product ?manufacturing DNAs? as a novel manufacturing knowledge representation among distributed systems, (2) architecture of interactive cyber spaces that combines cross-platform simulation results within product lifecycles, (3) data-driven control theories during process monitoring leading to rapid autonomous decision-making in replacement of manual input/output modules, and (4) robust business models and operations research (information service-oriented) concerning autonomous Key Performance Indicator (KPI) decomposition among distributed sub-systems and rapid feedback control loops. This will build a foundation for real-time production information sharing and control platforms and facilitate manufacturing knowledge generation and utilization among networked systems to address manufacturing management challenges.

A promising approach combines enzymes with synthetic polymers. Attaching enzymes to synthetic materials has been shown to enhance their recyclability. This approach has also been shown to decrease enzyme denaturation in extreme environments. However, little is understood about why certain materials stabilize some enzymes but not others. The overall goal is to understand and develop design rules on how to stabilize enzymes via immobilization to complex synthetic materials. This project will also provide multi-disciplinary training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Project results will feed into an annual data science capstone project.<br/><br/>Protein stabilization can be regulated by tuning the composition of random copolymer brushes to which the protein is attached. A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of this approach is critical. This understanding will be achieved by combining functional stability measurements, single-molecule methods to quantify conformational dynamics (e.g., unfolding and re-folding rates), and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Using this approach, the hypothesis that the chemical properties of the brush layer and enzyme surface should be well-correlated. To systematically test this hypothesis, several closely related, but structurally diverse lipases will be used. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer and simulations will be used to distinguish between possible mechanisms of stabilization. Mechanisms to be evaluated via tuning the enzyme-brush interface, will include enhanced re-folding (i.e., a chaperone-like effect) and reduced unfolding. Additionally, the salient chemical features of the brush layer that contribute to the stabilization of enzymes will be identified. This work will leverage a novel algorithm to model and identify clusters of hydrophobic atoms on protein surfaces using unsupervised machine learning.

How are listeners able to extract a clear signal from such loud background noise? The goal of this project is to try to understand how lower brain areas in the auditory pathway interact with higher auditory cortical areas in the brain when we try to communicate in acoustically challenging conditions. The lower parts of the auditory system, which are located in the brainstem and midbrain, process sounds and send information to higher level cortical areas to be analyzed and understood. The cortex also sends signals back down to the lower auditory centers?but the nature of these ?top-down? signals and how they help us listen is not known. Remarkably, there are more top-down projections in the auditory system than ?bottom-up? projections. This suggests that higher areas are shaping the incoming auditory information through these top-down projections. Understanding these top-down signals can help us understand why some people, even with normal hearing, struggle to understand what is being said to them when there is a lot of background noise. Untangling the role of these top-down signals can also inform our understanding of auditory perception and how much of it is driven by the external sounds out in the world, or shaped by internal information such expectation, or filtered by selective attention. In addition to the scientific goals, this project will include an integrated research, education, and outreach plan which will give high school students and undergraduates hands-on experiences in dynamic brain imaging as part of classes and summer outreach programs on auditory perception and auditory neuroscience.<br/><br/>To deepen understanding of the role of the top-down projections, researchers will measure subjects? brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while study participants listen to a variety of sounds including clicks, music and speech. The project will study how top-down attention affects subcortical auditory processing by playing two stories for subjects and asking them to attend to one of them, and then comparing the brain responses to the attended versus the unattended story. Researchers will also test how visual top-down signals affect subcortical auditory responses by comparing brain responses from subjects presented with recordings of speech where the video of the talker either matches the speech audio or is mismatched. Using a set of mathematical tools that model auditory processing called ?encoding models,? it will be possible to analyze the contribution of top-down connections to help lower auditory areas to process the speech sounds.  Researchers will take a big data approach and develop the next generation of encoding models by using a deep neural network approach to analyze massive amounts of brain data gathered from many EEG recordings of a small number of subjects over many weeks. This approach will give researchers more powerful tools to analyze aspects of auditory processing and attention. The use of these more sophisticated encoding models will illuminate the critical role lower auditory centers play in perception, reveal the strong impact of top-down signals on auditory perception, and more generally, the role that top-down signals play in all shaping perception from all sensory modalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development of iron- and copper-based photocatalysts will result in significant reductions in the overall cost, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas emissions from the cross-coupling processes. The project includes educational activities that build upon the proposed research to infuse photocatalysis and solar energy concepts into the chemical engineering curriculum at Oklahoma State University (OSU). The proposed curriculum will prepare the students for the 21st century`s challenges and directly benefit the undergraduate and graduate students at OSU.<br/><br/>The C-C and C-N cross-coupling reactions have been conventionally carried out by homogeneous Pd complex-catalyzed batch processes. There remains a critical need to develop inexpensive heterogeneous nanocatalysts for these cross-coupling reactions since nanocatalysts are the ideal catalysts for the most desired continuous flow processes. This project will focus on the design of earth-abundant and inexpensive iron- and copper-based hybrid Mie-resonator nanoparticles as heterogeneous visible light photocatalysts for C-C and C-N cross-coupling reactions. Specifically, the project will develop the structure-property-performance relationships by examining the size/shape of hybrid Mie-resonator nanoparticles against their charge carriers generation rate, the electron-transfer efficiency, and the photocatalytic rate for the C-C and C-N cross-coupling reactions. To accomplish this research objective, the project will utilize a combination of experimental and theoretical tools, including nanoparticles geometry-controlled synthesis techniques, finite-difference time-domain optical simulations, in-situ spectroscopic techniques, and photoreactor studies. The project will also establish the conditions of photocatalytic stability for the iron- and copper-based hybrid Mie-resonator nanoparticles to operate under the cross-coupling reaction conditions. The photocatalytic stability of the hybrid Mie-resonator nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes (spheres and cubes) will be investigated as a function of light intensity. The stability and the possible phase transformation at high light intensity will be characterized using in-situ UV-Vis extinction spectroscopy. The outcomes of this specific research objective will identify the combination of optimal geometries and optimal light intensity that can maintain the photocatalytic stability of iron- and copper-based hybrid Mie-resonator nanoparticles for the C-C and C-N cross-coupling reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main contribution is SpaceNet, the first-of-its-kind, fully open-source HIL space network testbed that is able to emulate a fast-changing network topology with changing connectivity and latencies, challenging routing, transport protocols, and re-architecting applications.<br/> <br/>The testbed will uniquely support multiple networks of distributed heterogeneous platforms in multiple domains, addressing challenges in adaptive communications for multi-constellation coexistence, emulating what has been called the ?internet of space things?. Direct connectivity allows for the exploration of how satellites and constellations might interconnect without revealing proprietary information of each constellation, creating the equivalent of interdomain routing for space networks. Additional capabilities examine behavior in the face of disruptions such as large solar storms. Achieving these new capabilities requires merging lab-based spacecraft hardware with a large-scale state-of-the-art wireless radio testbed to create more flexible and higher fidelity rendering of the satellite links, resulting in a networked HIL development and a testing environment that accurately models the network and dynamics; routing and re-routing data link tables on the fly, scaled to multiply-redundant algorithms and architectures; satellite-like lab hardware for testbed nodes; and virtual nodes and remote access for government, industry, and academic researchers.<br/> <br/>The expected outcome is a remotely-accessible, multi-domain network and cybersecurity research infrastructure, and a validated first-of-its-kind adaptive and assured space network communications emulator. In addition, students will be involved in class projects covering technical concepts on space communications, TN/NTN co-existence, and hands-on experiences with SpaceNet. Project outcomes will be widely disseminated via workshops, tutorials, software repositories, peer-reviewed conferences, and scholarly archival journals. The broader wireless communications communities will be engaged in the design, development, use, and maintenance of the proposed CISE infrastructure.<br/> <br/>The project repository will be linked from the proposal and milestones page at https://space-net.org at least through the duration of the project, and will be used for sharing research updates, workshop livestreams, dataset, code, and preprints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching theme of the project is to address the pressing new challenges that arise as differential privacy transforms from a theoretical construct into a practical technology. The project advances the state-of-the-art of research in the area of DP, and contributes to privacy education. On the research front, the project develops new algorithms and analytical tools that enable more precise privacy accounting and higher utility in DP. On the education front, the project involves training future leaders in DP areas, creating educational materials and expanding an open-source software library called autodp that makes state-of-the-art differentially private computation more accessible. Collectively, the integrated research and educational activities contribute to ongoing collaborative efforts in building innovative applications of differential privacy.<br/> <br/>The project has three main components in use-inspired fundamental research. The first component unifies the recent breakthroughs in DP, such as, Renyi DP, moments accountant, f-DP and produce an intermediate functional representation that allows lossless conversions among these representations. The second component focuses on investigating the stronger privacy properties permitted by the structures of the actual data, and addressing the dilemma of interpreting  worst-case privacy on average-case data. The third component focuses on using a public dataset to ``denoise'' the private data releases or to facilitate private machine learning. The outputs of the research will be broadly shared through integration in autodp library, and will be integrated in courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contaminants can pose harm to both people and wildlife, with specific harms and exposures dependent on complex socio-ecological factors. This study investigates environmental risk vis-a-vis mercury (Hg) released from artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sites. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin used to amalgamate gold in ASGM contexts globally. ASGM has become the leading cause of mercury emissions worldwide and is particularly harmful when burned off gold and emitted as gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). However, little is known about the fate of mercury from ASGM activities, including if and how mercury accumulates in crops, or local knowledge of mercury dangers and exposure routes, all of which contribute to actual and perceived environmental risk. This research asks: (1) What is the local and regional fate of Hg vaporized from ASGM in terrestrial ecosystems? (2) To what extent is Hg accumulating in crops grown near ASGM, and how do landscape and soil characteristics impact crop Hg concentrations? (3) How do local people understand Hg contamination and exposure, and how do spatialities of local knowledge articulate with environmental contamination variability? Results from this research will provide direct benefits related to the goals of the recently ratified International Minamata Convention on Mercury. <br/><br/>The research focuses on mercury in Ghanaian ASGM systems with contrasting geology, mining type, climate, and ecosystem. Ghana possesses extensive ASGM activities, which increased dramatically in the last 15 years. To query the research questions, the researchers employ mixed methods including community mapping activities and semi-structured interviews, biogeochemical data collection (passive air samples, bulk deposition, throughfall, litterfall, soil, and crop) and modeling (empirically constrained mass budgets, Lagrangian plume models). As farmers grow crops directly adjacent to ASGM sites, this project models where mercury travels, and how it accumulates in agricultural fields and specific staple crops grown in both communities (e.g. cassava, cocoa yam, plantain). The data generated from this proposal will improve Hg models, allowing for better understanding of environmental risks and contamination dynamics (i.e., Hg use, atmospheric transport, deposition, soil storage, and crop accumulation) associated with localized ASGM activity. Furthermore, this research systematically investigates what soil and landscape features lead to the accumulation of Hg within crops to better understand potential human exposure pathways to Hg beyond occupational exposure and consumption of contaminated fish. At the end of the project, workshops and training will be organized to inform harm reduction practices, including agricultural and mining practices to reduce mercury accumulation in crops, and other local exposures. This research links together concepts from political ecology and landscape ecology in a dynamic bi-directional coupling of socio-environmental systems that determines where and when contaminants deposit and accumulate on the landscape. The concept of ?environmental risk landscape? can be further developed to evaluate environmental risk in other socio-environmental contexts, including environmental injustice in the U.S.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been the driving force behind several recent high-profile successes of artificial intelligence, enjoying success in areas as diverse as robotic control, wireless communications, and protein structure prediction. While reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for learning, data efficiency is a fundamental challenge: this framework is known to require significant computational resources and vast amount of data. This challenge limits the applicability of reinforcement learning and keeps it from being applied in problems where training data and computational power are limited, including important applications such as wildfire monitoring and the search-and-rescue of lost people using unmanned aerial vehicles. This project addresses this challenge by developing new mathematical foundations of multi-task reinforcement learning and novel learning algorithms that require less data in the aggregate when multiple tasks are jointly learned. The project integrates the research findings with rigorous educational and outreach activities, course development, and student training.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on answering two fundamental questions: (1) Under what conditions does it take less data and computation to learn multiple tasks jointly than it would to learn each task individually? and (2) Can reinforcement learning algorithms learn something meaningful with only a limited amount of data and computation? Our approach to answering these questions draws on techniques from online learning, compressed sensing, and stochastic modeling.  In particular, this project covers both offline settings, where the similarity structure between tasks is learned from a given data set, and online settings, where this learned structure is used to efficiently adapt to a new task ?on the fly?. The project also addresses the fundamental problem of catastrophic forgetting in multi-task learning, where the learned policy loses the ability to perform a previous task after training for a new task. Over the course of this project, the proposed research activities will be evaluated systematically through a series of simulations of multi-robot navigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, gestures observed when listening to speech vary in the extent to which they enhance learning, and it is currently poorly understood why this is the case. This CAREER award examines how the information conveyed via gesture and its relationship to speech affects the learning of words from a novel second language differing in pronunciation and meaning. By examining how the brain processes such words learned with gestures differing in these ways, it will provide insight into why various types of gestures affect learning differently.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this CAREER award are to (1) determine how information conveyed via gesture and its congruence with speech at learning affects subsequent processing of learned content conveyed via speech; (2) characterize how sensitivity to information conveyed via gesture and its congruence with speech prior to learning affects the impact of gesture on learning and subsequent processing of learned content conveyed via speech; and (3) identify how brain regions subserving multimodal and language processing affect gesture-speech integration and subsequent processing of learned content conveyed via speech. The research approach achieves these objectives by examining how observing gestures congruent and incongruent with non-native speech sounds and word referents at learning affects subsequent processing of learned second language (L2) words via accuracy and latency, event-related potentials (ERPs), and transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), which causally affects brain activity. In doing so, it will contribute to the development of a theory of gesture?s impact on learning applicable across diverse content areas specifying the neural substrates of the cognitive mechanisms of gesture?s impact on learning.  The educational objectives of this CAREER award will integrate scaffolded inquiry-based learning utilizing ERP research methods into the educational neuroscience curriculum;  engage students from diverse backgrounds students in the proposed research and educational activities; and advance replication and translation of findings in L2 pedagogical contexts.  Together, these activities will help bridge the gap between educational neuroscience research and pedagogical practice in multiple educational contexts.
