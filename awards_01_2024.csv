A worldwide effort is underway to create larger, more reliable quantum computers, enhancing their ability to execute complex quantum algorithms. Despite this progress, practical quantum computing faces significant challenges, including the susceptibility of quantum bit (qubit) devices to environmental noise, producing inaccurate results. Furthermore, the limited availability of algorithms that can leverage quantum computers in the near term is a significant hurdle, as existing algorithms require millions of noise-free operations beyond the current quantum hardware capabilities. The gap between the quantum hardware necessary for solving real-world problems and today's quantum computing technology is significant. This award seeks to bridge this gap by focusing on scalable and resilient quantum computer architectures through an integrated approach to hardware and software design and developing software tools to help users leverage existing and future quantum hardware. Moreover, this award will create a broadly accessible quantum computing curriculum and support outreach activities to engage and educate undergraduates in quantum information sciences.<br/>  <br/>This project focuses on two research thrusts. The first thrust concentrates on co-designing Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and Runtime to enable efficient and resilient architectures and introduce new hardware-software primitives to help scale distributed qubit control. On the ISA front, the project will investigate how flexible instruction sets offered by most quantum hardware platforms, which allow new gates by calibrating pulses, can be leveraged without overly increasing the calibration complexity. For enabling a large number of operations on a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC), required by most real-world applications, this project will develop a runtime capable of detecting noise amplification events due to unstable qubit devices and mitigating them by moving data and learning optimal noise mitigation policies. The second thrust of this project will focus on developing software tools to facilitate efficient empirical design and evaluation of quantum algorithms. To that end, the project will develop tools to design, tune, and debug hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Moreover, the project will study the efficacy of partially fault-tolerant quantum computer architectures, where only a subset of operations are protected against errors, and investigate if co-designing ISA, runtime, error correction, and applications can push partial FTQC toward practical utility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geotechnical site investigation is critical to safe, cost-efficient, and resilient civil infrastructure. However, it remains a challenge for civil engineering practice. Insufficient site investigation is a primary reason for project budget and timeline overruns or insurance claims on construction projects. The cone penetration test collects subsurface data and is used throughout geotechnical and environmental engineering practice. Engineers use cone penetration test data cautiously when soils and conditions vary from the standard soils that data interpretation methods were developed and validated with. Findings from this research are intended to provide engineers with a more capable framework for site investigation by (1) estimating advanced engineering parameters from cone penetration test data for standard and non-standard soil types, therefore allowing engineers to do more with the data, and (2) quantifying uncertainties associated with site investigation data for both standard and non-standard soils, therefore enabling engineers to propagate uncertainties to predicted performance of infrastructure, and evaluate the value of additional data. This project integrates research with an education and outreach program for community college transfer students that aims to increase the number of students who successfully transfer to and graduate from four-year Civil Engineering programs. The project will support outreach events at local community colleges, organization of an annual transfer student workshop, including research lab tours and outreach demonstrations, and hosting undergraduate community college transfer students in research intern positions.<br/><br/>This research will advance site investigation methods by examining fundamental soil-load interactions during cone penetration testing and characterizing uncertainties stemming from soil parameter estimation. The objectives of this research are to (i) investigate relationships between soil type, soil properties, initial conditions, critical state line position and shape, and cone penetration test data, (ii) investigate uncertainty quantification for cone penetration test-based soil parameter interpretation in standard and non-standard soils, and (iii) explore uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in the broader context of site investigation. An integrated program of advanced laboratory testing, a system-level computational cone penetration model, and physical cone penetration tests will characterize the fundamental role of the soil critical state line and initial state on cone penetration test data. The anticipated outcome of this investigation is a critical state line-based interpretation approach for cone penetration test data that will be developed and validated across a range of standard and non-standard soils. A large dataset of soil properties and site investigation information will be used to investigate uncertainty associated with soil parameter estimation from site investigation data. This assessment will enable a framework for uncertainty-informed site investigation that will propagate uncertainties from site tests to design and predicted performance, enabling engineers to use quantifiable metrics for site investigation decisions alongside their engineering judgment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The imperative to integrate more RFFE elements within the confined space and power constraints of handheld devices is underscored by the surge in 5G/6G technology, necessitating compact hardware with low power consumption. Our overarching vision is to simplify RFFE complexity and enable superior transceivers by developing chip-scale functionalities with smaller size, higher efficiency and more tunability. Among RFFE components, piezoelectric acoustic microsystems emerge as a key solution, boasting four orders of magnitude smaller sizes and lower losses than conventional electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. Currently dominating RFFE filter solutions in the sub-6-GHz spectrum, these microsystems hold the potential to revolutionize signal processing if extended into the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) spectrum. Hence, overcoming longstanding challenges related to existing acoustic platforms and device designs in mm-wave spectrum is the primary objective of this proposal.

Committed to STEM education, the project closely integrates research into undergraduate and graduate curricula, mentoring of students, and K-12 learning modules. The research will be closely integrated with undergraduate-level course of Microwave Engineering and graduate-level course of Microelectromechanical Systems. Dissemination through webinars events ensures wide-reaching impact, and industry collaboration fosters practical applications of research findings in RF acoustics.

To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) to measure the transient concentration of NO, NO2, N2O, H2O, and/or temperature behind the reflected shock in a shock tube.

The project builds on a research approach termed In Situ Enzymatic Screening (ISES) to exploit enzymes as catalytic reporters to facilitate reaction discovery and catalyst optimization. The approach assists experimentalists in real time, enables parallel catalyst screening, and facilitates reaction discovery.  Parallel screening methods are of great interest to both academic chemists and chemists in industry, in both the large industrial chemical companies and particularly on the process side in pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Beyond the technical aspects, the project will help to build the future STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce by training a diverse group of students in an interdisciplinary research environment that includes elements of chemical synthesis, analytical chemistry, and chemical biology.<br/><br/>The targeted platform reactions for each of the three aims of this proposal build on the strong foundation established by the investigator's  group in developing unnatural amino acids (AAs) bearing ?fluorovinyl triggers.? This research follows earlier proof of concept studies from the group, demonstrating that both the alpha-(2?Z-fluoro)vinyl trigger and the alpha-(1?-fluoro)vinyl trigger have great promise for the mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of PLP enzymes. Each of the classes of novel unnatural amino acids (AAs) will be of value to the synthetic, medicinal and peptide chemistry communities, as well. The three aims in this proposal each have a (i) synthetic/catalytic goal; (ii) a screening goal and (iii) a chemical biology goal. Aim 1 of this project targets the enantioselective synthesis of the parent compound, L- and D- alpha-(1?-fluoro)vinylglycine via TM-mediated intramolecular amination. Preliminary studies demonstrate ?phosphate-ISES? in a new fluorescence mode. Promising results with Ni(bis-phosphine) catalysts are presented, offering a highly enantioselective route with an earth abundant transition metal catalyst. Chemical biology studies will probe the enantioselectivity of the inhibition of tryptophan synthase with L- and D- alpha-(1?-fluoro)vinylglycine, as well as examining these enantiomeric MBI candidates with other high value enzymes. Aim 2 involves the quaternization of both the vinyl trigger (Aim 2A) and of the alpha-(1?-fluoro)vinyl trigger (Aim 2B). Experimental work points to the possibility of using a complementary variant of fluorescence ISES here with carbonate leaving groups and alcohol oxidase/peroxidase couple using the MNBDH dye indicator. Moreover, preliminary screening results suggest that quaternary a-vinyl AAs can be accessed in high ee under Pd(SiPhox)-catalysis.  Aim 3A and 3B propose to develop catalytic chemistry into new classes of ?side chain-embedded? 1?-fluorovinyl and 2?-fluorovinyl AAs, respectively. On the chemical biology side, an exciting preliminary result shows that the ?embedded? 1?-fluorovinyl is a trigger for glutamate decarboxylase inactivation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technique offers the opportunity to construct and repair parts in layers using both powder and wire feedstocks. Wire feedstocks necessitate high laser energy for melting and may form unstable melt pools resulting in reduced processability. Conversely, powder particles, being smaller and possessing a higher surface area, are easier to melt and fuse with reduced instability. This research project integrates the advantages of both powder and wire deposition ? powder's improved processability and wire's higher deposition rate ? to establish a new manufacturing paradigm of co-axial wire feed-powder feed laser directed energy deposition. The resulting knowledge enables wider adoption of wire-based additive manufacturing, holding the potential to fabricate sound large-scale parts for power generation, propulsion, and space exploration at reduced cost and material waste. Thus, the research augments U.S. manufacturing, competitiveness, and economy. Furthermore, this research is complemented by educational and outreach initiatives that empower future engineers and scientists to achieve professional excellence while prioritizing personal well-being. The project provides comprehensive professional and leadership training, facilitates strategic networking opportunities, and assists individuals in making informed career choices.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to unveil the fundamental mechanisms governing the relationships between processing, microstructure, and properties in co-axial wire feed-powder feed laser directed energy deposition (DED) of metals. The fundamental differences in parts created by DED using wire or powder feedstocks under as-built conditions are laser-material interactions, melting and solidification phenomena, and the overall bulk behavior. Consequently, the research objectives of this project encompass: (i) comparing deposit formations in the co-axial wire feed-powder feed process with singular powder and wire feed processes; (ii) assessing the evolution of melt pools and quantifying crucial microstructural characteristics; and (iii) establishing correlations between tensile strengthening mechanisms and a spectrum of varying wire-to-powder feed ratios. By pursuing these research objectives, the project aims to address fundamental questions, including: (i) the impact of powder addition on the processability of wire DED such as reduction in Rayleigh-Plateau melt instabilities; (ii) the specific role played by powder particles in influencing the shape of melt pools and the development of solidification microstructures; and (iii) the variations in individual tensile strengthening mechanisms due to powder incorporation.

In addition, researchers know little about the impact novel polygenic traits have on population divergence and speciation. To address these deficiencies, this work will focus on three aims. First, it will uncover the molecular mechanisms that underlie change of the genotype-to-phenotype map in a model butterfly species.

Research efforts to understand these disease mechanisms benefit from predicting the accurate placement of proteins in membranes. However, the existing computational prediction methods typically perform as standalone applications, and their use in conjunction with other protein modeling tools cannot be automated. To address these gaps, this work develops an efficient framework for the accurate placement of membrane proteins in cell membranes while enabling integration with other computational tools frequently used to design or assess membrane protein structure in a modular manner.

This has intensified the urgency to identify efficient methods for safeguarding exchanged information during data communication and Machine-Learning training. Fully homomorphic encryption, operating on encrypted data without decryption, emerges as a promising solution. However, its practical integration faces challenges, notably in algorithm intricacy and computational constraints, especially regarding latency. This project aims to optimize resource-intensive operations in existing fully homomorphic encryption schemes and seamlessly integrate the optimized algorithm into federated learning frameworks.

This resource recovery approach is driven by national and global challenges related to population growth, climate change, and resource scarcity. Rural agricultural regions are prime locations for resource recovery because they are typically abundant in organic waste streams such as animal manure and agricultural crop residues while also requiring fertilizer for crop production. Rural agricultural regions may generate so much organic waste that excess waste is shipped to other watersheds. Therefore, these regions could receive increased economic benefits and reduced environmental impacts if the excess waste was not shipped out and instead used as a feedstock for the recovery of energy and nutrients. However, such rural regions face challenges in implementing resource recovery technologies due to limited technical and economic resources, unavailable or inaccessible data, and lack of contextual policy support. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this CAREER project is to promote sustainable, context-sensitive resource recovery in rural regions. Successful completion of research and educational objectives on the topics of data science, life cycle modeling, policy, and stakeholder engagement will provide a data-driven, cost-effective framework to bridge the gap between research and implementation of resource recovery technologies in rural agricultural regions. Stakeholder engagement and policy dissemination will facilitate increased adoption of best practices for organic waste management.<br/><br/>Current organic waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration negatively impact the environment by emitting greenhouse gases, harmful contaminants, and pathogens. However, recovery of resources such as energy and nutrients from organic waste can reduce such negative impacts. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop, apply, and assess a data-driven framework that integrates data science, life cycle modeling, and policy analysis to promote sustainable, context-sensitive resource recovery in rural agricultural regions. The recent emergence of powerful data science tools can effectively predict outcomes such as recovery efficiency, economic impacts, and environmental impacts. While larger wastewater utilities are beginning to use data science methods to improve treatment efficiency and reduce chemical and energy use, the use of data science in rural organic waste management is unexplored. Therefore, an opportunity exists to utilize data science tools with accessible datasets and generalized methods integrated with stakeholder engagement and contextual policy support. This strategy can provide a data-driven, cost-effective framework to bridge the gap between research and implementation of resource recovery technologies in rural farming regions. Implementation of this framework could allow rural farming regions nationally and internationally to strategically utilize their organic waste to best reflect their environmental, economic, social, political, and geographical context. The long-term educational goal is to increase the ?impact competencies? in civil engineering students by providing training and practice on sustainable development, data science, and policy. In pursuit of this, the educational objectives of this proposal include integrating undergraduate and graduate learning modules and creating a pathway within the civil engineering MS curriculum that includes one year of stateside community-engaged service integrated with a research thesis. Broader impacts of the educational plan result from stakeholder engagement with community partners in undergraduate and graduate courses and providing needed yet underrepresented skills in data science and policy to undergraduate students that they can use to transition to the marketplace or graduate school.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is inspired by the need for assistive robots that help elderly and disabled adults perform everyday tasks. The crucial challenge lies in fostering seamless and safe interaction between humans and robots. When people rely on assistive robots, they need robots that learn what the user wants (i.e., the robot understands the human) and clearly communicate their intent (i.e., the human understands the robot). The investigator's team will develop hardware and software tools to facilitate communication between robots and humans through visual, auditory, and haptic interfaces. This project will also support robotics education by i) teaching deaf and blind high school students to build interfaces that communicate with assistive robot arms; ii) mentoring college seniors as they program ""learn & share"" robots that test the limits of the unified framework; and by iii) bringing engineering faculty outside of traditional inclusion groups into a safe space to discuss their journeys. <br/><br/>The insight driving this research is that effective communication informs learning and vice versa. Users with knowledge about their robot's learning enhance their ability to operate it, while the robot's learning dictates what it should communicate. With this insight in mind, research performed in association with this CAREER award has three main objectives: (from human to robot) learning to assist the human robustly and intuitively, (from robot to human) communicating robot learning with personalized and interpretable feedback, and (co-adaptation) unifying learning and communication under a single, interconnected dynamical system that allows the robot and the human to interact and adapt. User studies will evaluate these contributions, involving participants controlling a robot arm in daily living activities. A unified formalism where learning and communication are two components of the same mathematical framework is the main scientific contribution. By combining these elements, the project transcends the limitations of separate development tracks for learning and communication, advancing knowledge in previously unattainable ways. The project's educational and outreach plan complements these research objectives and teaches the next generation of engineers to deeply consider how users understand and co-adapt to new autonomous technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are used in trace gas spectroscopy for the detection of chemical hazards and disease-correlated biomarkers, in stellar spectroscopy in the search for Earth-like exoplanets, and as critical components of optical atomic clocks. Although their use is now ubiquitous, optical frequency combs are largely confined to specialized optics laboratories. However, this is changing. Recently, optical frequency combs have been realized using chip-scale microring cavities and the nonlinear Kerr effect. The promise of these ?microcombs? lies in the possibility of replacing a research laboratory dedicated to precision measurement with a comb-on-a-chip platform that can perform precision measurements far from the optics lab. As with many precision measurement instruments, microcomb precision is limited by material thermal noise, a limitation which is worsened by the small volume of the microring. Building on recent work investigating how material noise affects comb precision, Drake and her team will develop a technique for microcomb noise reduction based on novel cavity geometries and comb operation. Decoupling material thermodynamics from the properties of the comb light represents an important and necessary milestone for the use of microcombs as state-of-the-art precision measurement instruments.<br/><br/>The PI proposes an in-depth investigation of the coupling of material thermal noise to the properties of microresonator optical frequency combs with the dual goals of better understanding and predicting the fundamental noise processes in microresonator optical frequency combs and creating microcomb systems with reduced thermal phase noise in both their microwave and optical frequencies. While the thermodynamics of matter are generally well understood, the intersection of thermal noise and nonlinear optics remains largely unexplored. In microcombs, the transduction of thermal fluctuations in the resonator material properties to noise on properties of the comb light (the microwave repetition rate or the optical comb modes) is highly dependent on the details of the comb state, include the Raman self-frequency shift and the presence of dispersive waves. This project encompasses a theoretical and experimental study of the connection between thermal and frequency/phase noise in microresonator frequency combs by introducing geometries and techniques that alter this relationship and that can be utilized to produce ultra-low phase noise signals. The overall goal of the research is the generation of low phase noise signals (primarily microwave and potentially optical as well) in low-cost, room temperature systems with the potential for future photonic integration. The PI will also develop a summer academy for area STEM educators focused on design and construction of optics-based projects (Optical Technology Inventors and Makers Academy, OPTIMA). Attendees will learn the principles of optics and optical design and will be encouraged to create optics projects that can be used as teaching material in their classes.

If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state.

Zooplankton include many different types of organisms that can be broadly categorized as crustacean or gelatinous, with most fish and whales preferring crustaceans as a fat-rich food source over gelatinous animals, which are higher in water content. Historically, the California Current ecosystem off the U.S. West Coast has been dominated by crustacean zooplankton, such as krill and copepods, but in 2014 there were huge abundances of a type of colonial, gelatinous zooplankton known as pyrosomes, which caused widespread damage to fisheries by fouling fishing gear and dominating catch. Although the arrival of pyrosomes coincided with an extensive marine heatwave, lower abundances have since persisted despite a return to cooler ocean temperatures. Analysis of time series data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) indicate that pyrosomes were also observed in the California Current many decades ago when the ocean was not particularly warm. This study combines analysis of past samples from CalCOFI, ocean circulation models, and biological models to understand the causes of these quickly growing pyrosome populations in the California Current.  It supports training for undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the project is reaching K-12 students through a unique partnership with the San Diego County Office of Education that is developing Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned resources for middle and high school science teachers in California. The educational resources are being disseminated through the California Science Project and California Environmental Literacy Initiative. Public outreach in San Diego (CA) is through the Enhancing Your Horizons San Diego conference and the San Diego Regional Competition of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl, and in Santa Cruz (CA) through the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.<br/><br/>Predicting how ecosystems respond to accelerating climate change is a major challenge. The recent appearance of the pyrosome Pyrosoma atlanticum in the California Current is a major perturbation to the ecosystem, and the cause remains unknown. Both ocean physics and plankton food-web dynamics are key determinants of variability in pelagic community composition in this ecosystem, yet unraveling the degree to which variability in physics (through warming and advection) combines with shifting biological interactions (through nutrient cycling and altered food-web dynamics) to determine composition and function is complicated. This project combines the analysis of past historical samples from seven decades of the CalCOFI time series, data-assimilative and non-data assimilative ocean circulation models, and biological population models to determine the role ocean physics and biological interactions have played in shaping pyrosome abundance, trophic dynamics, and population growth and mortality in the California Current.

However, current simulations often focus on predicting an optimal solution (such as walking faster or more symmetrically) without regard to how this will be achieved. This CAREER projects seeks to develop a new neuromechanical simulation framework that models how patients adapt to walking rehabilitation. The framework will lay the foundation for a new and potentially transformative approach for patient-specific prescription of gait rehabilitation. This CAREER project will also pursue outreach and educational activities to (1) train the next generation of engineers to prioritize clinician and patient perspectives and (2) educate clinicians and patients about the potential of neuromechanical simulations in gait rehabilitation.<br/> <br/>The investigator?s long-term goal is to develop neuromechanical simulations for clinical decision-making in gait neurorehabilitation. Towards this goal, this CAREER project seeks to develop a novel simulation framework that models the adaptation of neuromuscular control underlying the restoration of functional gait ability. As a proof-of-concept, the investigator will develop this framework on an error-augmentation based gait training intervention that amplifies instability to challenge and retrain walking balance control. The research activities are divided into two interconnected foci. Focus one will capture muscle activity and kinematics from a diverse population - young adults, older adult fallers, and stroke survivors -  while walking in the error-augmentation environment. Focus two will develop a simulation framework to model individual-specific adaptation to this environment. This project will first develop a theory-based framework in which neuromuscular control is optimized via exploration to maximize walking balance and minimize effort.

The approach prioritizes fairness by enhancing statistical algorithms to perform equitably, particularly in scenarios with limited sample sizes and where sensitive attributes are restricted by legal or societal norms. In parallel, this project addresses privacy by developing a general framework for studying the privacy-accuracy trade-off under new privacy constraints emerging with the advances in generative AI.

The concept of emergence will be explored in the context of dynamic and stochastic, multiscale dispersive wave phenomena described by nonlinear partial differential equations.  This program will host approximately 35 long-term, residential visitors at any given time and 60 or more participants in a one-week workshop. The diverse, international roster of participants includes leading researchers in the applied mathematical sciences. This National Science Foundation award provides travel support for early career applied mathematicians from the United States to participate in the workshop and the program. Traditionally underrepresented groups in applied mathematics will be encouraged to apply. This support enables sustained opportunities to interact with leading researchers from around the world. Such interactions and contacts are invaluable to beginning researchers, both to inspire research, and for professional development, thereby helping to cultivate the very best young researchers. These researchers will be the next generation of applied mathematicians who advance this and other applied mathematical fields of research.<br/><br/>Emergence is a powerful concept that plays a fundamental role in many areas of theoretical and mathematical physics. In a system composed of a very large number of elementary constituents, e.g. classical or quantum particles, the observable macroscopic behavior can be highly nontrivial. This transition from short-to-large scales is at the heart of hydrodynamic theories for inhomogeneous, dynamic many-body states. A very different kind of hydrodynamics arises when the microscopic constituents are waves. The subject of dispersive hydrodynamics?the theory of multiscale phenomena in nonlinear dispersive waves?has attracted much attention recently and was the focus of the 2022 ""Dispersive Hydrodynamics"" (HYD2) program held at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK. The satellite PDW program aims to capitalize on the successful HYD2 program to explore new frontiers of dispersive hydrodynamics in relation to the overarching theme of emergent phenomena in nonlinear waves. In particular, PDW will focus on three highly synergistic themes: (i) emergent hydrodynamics in integrable and nonintegrable systems; (ii) stability of nonlinear dispersive waves and emergent phenomena in unstable wave systems; (iii) soliton gas, generalized hydrodynamics and statistical mechanics of integrable systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.  With the completion of the human genome project, more and more SNPs have been identified as biomarkers for life-threatening diseases. Detecting such SNPs is of particular importance to the fields of cancer diagnosis, pathogen detection, and various health condition monitoring. The standard methods to detect SNPs rely on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), but are largely limited by their poor sensitivity and bad accuracy. This CAREER project will exploit the newly discovered CRISPR technology to detect disease-related SNPs, improving human health. To provide broader impacts on a national level, this project will pursue the following two education and outreach goals: 1) broaden participation in careers in biotechnology and 2) equip undergraduate and graduate students with the required biotechnology knowledge and hands-on experience. <br/><br/>In bacteria and archaea cells, CRISPR was developed as an adaptive defense system against viral infections. In addition to gene editing, CRISPR technology has been applied to detect nucleic acids in the past few years. This NSF CAREER project aims to study the fundamental properties of CRISPR Cas nucleases through their non-specific collateral activities (also named ?trans-cleavage? activity) and apply the knowledge to detect disease-related SNPs. The central hypothesis is that systematic characterization and optimization of the trans-cleavage activities of the CRISPR Cas nucleases (Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14) will provide a solid foundation to develop novel biosensing approaches for the ultra-accurate detection of disease-related SNPs (less than 0.1% SNPs in wild type can be detected). The major research objectives are: 1) enable an ultra-accurate detection of SNPs using a CRISPR-Cas14 biosensor; 2) design a ratiometric detection of SNPs using biorthogonal CRISPR-Cas13 systems; and 3) demonstrate CRISPR-12 array sensors to identify multiple SNPs simultaneously.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon has pivotal influence on the appearance of fisheries in different parts of the world. The study will use mathematical models that represent idealized conditions for upwelling over a sloping continental shelf. Despite the idealizations, the models will add three-dimensionality aspects and dynamical effects caused by different water densities, i.e., by buoyancy. Results will be cast in a framework that includes the slope of the continental shelf, buoyancy effects and Earth?s rotation influence. As broader impacts, the study is expected to improve understanding on a process that affects dissolved and suspended materials near the coast. It also will train a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and two undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The proposal will explore three-dimensional pathways for coastal upwelling under vertically stratified ocean conditions. The study will use a series of idealized 3D numerical simulations, contrasting the customary 2D descriptions associated with Ekman dynamics. Simulations will be placed in a holistic framework that accounts for the interactions among wind-driven circulation, (sub)mesoscale turbulence, and boundary layer processes. Thus, simulations will address the coupling between surface and bottom boundary layers through a framework based on the slope Burger number, which compares buoyancy and Coriolis frequencies. The Burger number is expected to diagnose whether the onshore flow is along the bottom or in the interior of the water column. A particularity of this study, in addition to examining three-dimensional structures, is the assessment of the role of baroclinic instability in shaping the upwelling structure via eddy stirring along isopycnals. As broader impacts, this study will contribute advanced understanding of coastal upwelling, which affects dissolved and suspended matter.

The spatial distribution of larvae from a given population, also known as the dispersal kernel, is an important parameter both for basic understanding of marine ecology and evolution, as well as for management and conservation of marine resources. Larval dispersal kernels are often studied using computer models which simulate the dispersal of larvae within ocean circulation models. However, there are very few measurements of marine larval dispersal with which to evaluate these computer models, due the cost and infeasibility of current genetic tagging methods. This project uses isolation by distance (IbD) population models, which the project team has shown gives similar results to genetic tagging methods, but at a fraction of the cost. Dispersal kernels are thought to be shaped by both species traits, such as the amount of time spent as planktonic larvae, as well as the environment through which the larvae disperse. To tease apart the effects of species traits and regional seascapes, the team is taking advantage of the unique setting of the South Pacific, where the numerous isolated archipelagos each independently replicate the dispersal process the team is studying. Six reef-fish species at ten locations in each of the New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and Fijian archipelagic seascapes are being sampled, IbD estimates of dispersal kernels are then used to select a set of computer models, and the models are simulated across twenty years of oceanographic data (many generations of fish) and a selection of species traits. The results of this research are being used to improve the design of networks of marine protected areas in each of the archipelagos in a way that accounts for variability in larval dispersal over time. This research builds on the efforts of the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet), created by the project?s principal investigators and senior personnel to promote collaborative research on the ecology and evolution of the immense biodiversity of the Indo-Pacific. The project also provides training for postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and supports capacity building workshops for local policymakers and students.<br/><br/>Populations of most marine species are functionally, demographically, and genetically connected by planktonic dispersal of tiny larvae. Understanding the spatial distribution of dispersal events (the dispersal kernel) is a fundamental goal of marine ecology and is critical to predicting population dynamics and evolutionary outcomes. Yet, general principles for predicting dispersal outcomes across communities remain elusive. The project team is developing the first-ever data-assimilated biophysical models of larval dispersal by: 1) applying isolation-by-distance (IbD) theory to estimate mean parent-offspring distance (?IbD) for six reef fish species co-sampled and RAD-seq genotyped at three isolated South Pacific archipelagos that each replicate the IbD process with relatively continuous reef systems, 2) using empirical estimates of ?IbD to constrain biophysical models of larval dispersal, which are iterated over twenty years of high-resolution hydrodynamic models, to test hypotheses about the relative role of species traits and seascape characteristics in shaping larval dispersal kernels, and 3) developing a new conservation portfolio approach to design managed area networks that capture temporal variability in larval dispersal over many generations, and engaging with local stakeholders in each archipelago to implement this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the behaviors and functions of cells are regulated by physical cues from their microenvironment, emerging research has suggested that the altered mechanics of tumor tissue plays a crucial role in the progression of metastatic cancers. To understand the relationship between the properties of the microenvironment and tumor growth, it is essential to quantify these mechanical properties with high spatial resolution in three dimensions. However, existing mechanical testing tools are mostly contact-based and invasive, making such measurement highly challenging. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to address the current technical challenge by developing an optical technology named photoacoustic-Brillouin microscopy (PABM), which can measure the mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment in a non-contact, non-invasive, and high-resolution manner. In concert with the research goal, this project will develop educational modules to promote the dissemination of the innovative Brillouin technology and to stimulate a lasting interest in biophotonics for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/><br/>Confocal Brillouin microscopy has been recently demonstrated as a promising non-contact mechanical testing tool. However, due to the lack of knowledge on refractive index and density of the sample under test, existing Brillouin microscopy is mostly used to estimate the relative mechanical change, rather than to provide an absolute measurement of mechanical modulus, making it inapplicable for heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, benchmarking, and comparison across studies. In this project, a novel optical technique named PABM will be developed based on the colocalized excitation of scattered Brillouin light and time-resolved photoacoustic signals. In addition to directly quantifying mechanical modulus, the PABM can provide complementary contrast mechanisms, including stiffness, optical absorption, and acoustic speed. This capability will enable a comprehensive understanding of heterogeneous processes in tumor growth. Taken together, the PABM addresses a significant gap in current cancer research methodologies. The new data and insights gained from this technology holds a unique potential to advance a wide range of research in both biophotonics and cancer diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Does it flow slowly through the mantle, or quickly through melt-rich channels? Answering this question will help understand where seafloor volcanoes form and how frequently they erupt. The project will acquire new geophysical and geological data in the Galapagos islands. This region has volcanism all the way from the main archipelago to the mid-ocean ridge a few hundred km away. The investigators will combine the new data with theoretical modeling to test different models for magma flow. The results will be important for other locations such as Reunion Island, Azores Islands, and Easter Island as well as global subduction zones. Broader impacts include support and training of a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar, opportunities for early career scientists to participate in the research cruise, collaboration with the Charles Darwin Foundation in Galapagos, and outreach to the public and K-12 students. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>The proposed works aims to significantly improve the understanding of melt transport in the asthenosphere, and melt localization processes, through an integrated multidisciplinary study. As a case study, the project will focus upon mantle plume/mid-ocean ridge interaction in the Galapagos which is exemplified by the enigmatic Wolf-Darwin Lineament. The proposed work includes three key components: (1) New marine resistivity imaging using magnetotelluric data sets for imaging melt distribution (with deployment of 90 ocean bottom broadband MT sites); (2) Geochemical analysis  (major and trace elements, volatile content, Sr, Nd, Pb and Fe isotopes) of existing and new dredge samples along the northern Galapagos lineaments and Western Galapagos Spreading Center; and (3) Geodynamical modeling of two-phase melt channelization to constrain the physical viability of melt localization.

The spatial distribution of larvae from a given population, also known as the dispersal kernel, is an important parameter both for basic understanding of marine ecology and evolution, as well as for management and conservation of marine resources. Larval dispersal kernels are often studied using computer models which simulate the dispersal of larvae within ocean circulation models. However, there are very few measurements of marine larval dispersal with which to evaluate these computer models, due the cost and infeasibility of current genetic tagging methods. This project uses isolation by distance (IbD) population models, which the project team has shown gives similar results to genetic tagging methods, but at a fraction of the cost. Dispersal kernels are thought to be shaped by both species traits, such as the amount of time spent as planktonic larvae, as well as the environment through which the larvae disperse. To tease apart the effects of species traits and regional seascapes, the team is taking advantage of the unique setting of the South Pacific, where the numerous isolated archipelagos each independently replicate the dispersal process the team is studying. Six reef-fish species at ten locations in each of the New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and Fijian archipelagic seascapes are being sampled, IbD estimates of dispersal kernels are then used to select a set of computer models, and the models are simulated across twenty years of oceanographic data (many generations of fish) and a selection of species traits. The results of this research are being used to improve the design of networks of marine protected areas in each of the archipelagos in a way that accounts for variability in larval dispersal over time. This research builds on the efforts of the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet), created by the project?s principal investigators and senior personnel to promote collaborative research on the ecology and evolution of the immense biodiversity of the Indo-Pacific. The project also provides training for postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and supports capacity building workshops for local policymakers and students.<br/><br/>Populations of most marine species are functionally, demographically, and genetically connected by planktonic dispersal of tiny larvae. Understanding the spatial distribution of dispersal events (the dispersal kernel) is a fundamental goal of marine ecology and is critical to predicting population dynamics and evolutionary outcomes. Yet, general principles for predicting dispersal outcomes across communities remain elusive. The project team is developing the first-ever data-assimilated biophysical models of larval dispersal by: 1) applying isolation-by-distance (IbD) theory to estimate mean parent-offspring distance (?IbD) for six reef fish species co-sampled and RAD-seq genotyped at three isolated South Pacific archipelagos that each replicate the IbD process with relatively continuous reef systems, 2) using empirical estimates of ?IbD to constrain biophysical models of larval dispersal, which are iterated over twenty years of high-resolution hydrodynamic models, to test hypotheses about the relative role of species traits and seascape characteristics in shaping larval dispersal kernels, and 3) developing a new conservation portfolio approach to design managed area networks that capture temporal variability in larval dispersal over many generations, and engaging with local stakeholders in each archipelago to implement this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graph theory is a powerful mathematical tool that can enumerate all possible pathways between manufacturing steps using specific rules of connectivity and can produce a ranked list of feasible pathways given case-specific criteria. However, the top-ranked pathways may still lead to concerns regarding overall process resilience - for example, a wastewater treatment facility faces failure risks due to infrastructure aging or extreme weather events. Thus, resilience, defined as the capability to withstand failures and recover from them, is incorporated as an additional metric. Machine learning algorithms can predict risk and failure probabilities from past operational data, which enables resilience evaluation of each feasible pathway. This research program will integrate graph theory and machine learning to fundamentally enhance process synthesis algorithms to generate cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and robust solutions that can be easily adapted to other chemical manufacturing operations, such as plastics recycling or solvent recovery in pharmaceuticals manufacturing. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students, this project will also contribute to the development of open-access educational modules and process systems case studies that feature environmental and social justice themes. Interactive activities for K-12 STEM outreach and competitions will be conducted for students and teachers from underserved communities in the southern New Jersey region.<br/><br/>A key limitation when designing chemical process networks is that the final design is only as good as the initial structural enumeration (superstructure), a large, complex network of chemical processing path options that must currently be defined by the design engineer. Existing superstructure synthesis methods are largely based on heuristics which can sometimes lead to suboptimality since there is no guarantee that all feasible paths have been captured in the initial enumeration. In this project, graph theory will be employed to generate an exhaustive enumeration of the overall process network (in this project a wastewater treatment plant network) through well-defined axioms and a maximal structure generation algorithm, wherein the possible process pathways are represented via the connection of materials and process technology nodes with arcs that represent stream flows. This exhaustive enumeration is followed by feasible pathway analysis to generate a ranked list of solution structures based on cost, energy use, environmental impact, and resilience metrics through a novel two-layer process synthesis algorithm that includes combinatorial, linear, and nonlinear model equations and solvers. The integration of machine learning for regression, classification, and feature importance modeling based on available wastewater treatment plant data and asset inventory will allow for timely prediction of risk and failure probabilities due to aging and extreme events. This enhanced process synthesis methodology will lead to non-intuitive, innovative, cost-effective, sustainable, and robust solutions that will enable stakeholders, such as municipalities and water utility companies, to make informed decisions when designing new facilities or retrofitting existing facilities. Materials developed as part of this project will include computational algorithms, codes, user manuals, tutorials, technical papers, conference presentations, educational materials, factsheets, and K-12 outreach plans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, the project provides a medium by publishing knowledge graphs for IoT manufacturers and users to know which standards or regulations a company follows and those that are missing without reading the privacy policy or IoT authority documents. Furthermore, the project approach will enable organizations to quickly query the knowledge graphs using SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) and correct their policy documents.

Historically, the California Current ecosystem off the U.S. West Coast has been dominated by crustacean zooplankton, such as krill and copepods, but in 2014 there were huge abundances of a type of colonial, gelatinous zooplankton known as pyrosomes, which caused widespread damage to fisheries by fouling fishing gear and dominating catch.

With a similar goal, this project conducts fundamental research seeking to advance the state-of-the-art in understanding the parsimonious principles of physics governing the behavior of a complex physical system under uncertainty. The resulting software framework enables the users to utilize data from a wide range of physical systems to unlock the important aspects of their behavior by analyzing the identified mathematical equations. With this framework, the project investigator provides the community of researchers and educators with a powerful and amenable tool to comprehend and predict the actual behavior of various real-world systems in the presence of uncertainty. <br/><br/>Harnessing already developed knowledge in understanding simplified physical systems with similar behavior, the framework builds a novel paradigm using interpretable deep learning for discovering parsimonious governing equations to describe the behavior of complex physical systems under uncertainty. New approaches to utilizing low-fidelity models in defining the system's behavior are also explored, providing even more computationally efficient tools to incorporate prior knowledge. These advancements and the developed software allow the framework to be applied to various application domains. The framework is evaluated with testbed problems such as the behavior of a 20-story building and a benchmark turbulence modeling problem. Furthermore, the resulting framework is applied to other critical problems of complex nature through collaborations, e.g., the spread of wildland fires, enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and the spread of pollutant plumes. The project also emphasizes the importance of identifying parsimonious governing equations to describe the behavior of complex systems through education and outreach activities.

One technique to study such large graphs is to understand them locally by determining how prevalent certain small substructures are, for example through homomorphism densities. The objective of this project is to further our understanding of graph profiles, objects that record all possible relationships between these local patterns.

Applying an alternating current (AC) electric field to electrolytes in a solution causes them to migrate because of their charge properties. This phenomenon is used in many important applications, including supercapacitors, high-rate batteries, and cellular and biomolecular manipulation like cell sorting. AC electric fields can be regular waves of alternating voltage (spatially uniform) or less predictable, irregular waves (spatially non-uniform). Scientists have assumed that applying AC voltages to an electrolyte solution encourages the electrolytes to migrate in a way that does not affect the overall bulk solution properties. However, recent research studies revealed that electrolyte bulk solution properties change when a spatially non-uniform AC electric field is applied. Effects such as flow reversal, pH shifts, solution osmotic pressure change, and the generation of ion concentration gradients were observed. This project?s objective is to understand how electrolytes and other charged particles respond to spatially non-uniform AC electric fields in bulk solutions over extended periods. This fundamental knowledge can be applied to develop novel technologies for molecular biosensing, water desalination, and high-throughput drug screening assays. The project will also support STEM outreach and educational activities. It aims to develop industrially relevant skillsets for graduate and undergraduate students through interactions with industrial leaders and industry-informed student projects. The investigator also aims to cultivate interest in STEM education and technology-driven solutions to enhance healthcare and societal well-being among high school students from underserved communities.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that the biased AC electromigration under spatially non-uniform AC electric fields facilitates the directed enrichment and generation of concentration gradients of biochemically relevant charged species in bulk aqueous phase and biofluids. The specific research objectives are to (A) engineer a new system for isolating confounding variables from biased AC electromigration, (B) interrogate the influence of spatially non-uniform AC electric field properties on biased AC electromigration behaviors of designated charged species, and (C) elucidate the influence of charged species? intrinsic properties on their biased AC electromigration behavior under designated spatially non-uniform AC electric fields. This project will provide a fundamental understanding of the behaviors of charged species under spatially non-uniform AC electric fields in the bulk solution beyond the electric double layer and at longer times than previously studied (>60 seconds). This fundamental understanding of biased AC electromigration is broadly relevant to many scientific communities; it can be applied to develop technologies that (1) selectively enrich or deplete biomolecules, which will improve the sensitivity and accuracy of biosensing by allowing the detection of concentrations of target molecules that are otherwise below detection limits and (2) generate spatially and temporally controllable and quantifiable two- and three-dimensional gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research within these communities increasingly pays attention to factors that promote health in addition to those that produce illness among Indigenous peoples. However, research often focuses on health-promoting factors that originate from biomedical interventions or structures, rather than on those that come from Indigenous communities themselves. Given the historic mistrust of biomedicine within Indigenous communities, and renewed calls for the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge within health-delivery, there is a need to engage with sources of health and wellness that come directly from Indigenous communities and collaborations. This doctoral dissertation research seeks to do so by examining the wellness programs at an Indigenous-serving school and non-profit, investigating how staff and students understand, consume, and produce health and wellness. In addition to training a graduate student, this study has relevance to interventions focused on Indigenous health disparity and sovereignty, especially those that rely on collaboration with Indigenous communities. More directly, study findings will be used to inform the development and maintenance of school wellness programs. <br/><br/>This is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project, meaning that the researcher and community collaborators share knowledge, decision-making power, and research products throughout the study process. This research collaboration will seek to answer several questions through interviews and the use of Photovoice: (1) How do Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff and students describe and differentiate between the concepts of ?health? and ?wellness??, (2) How does the co-existence of Indigenous and Western systems of knowledge impact conceptions of health and wellness?, (3) How do staff/students collaborate on health and wellness work, and how do these collaborations impact outcomes related to school and community health? The school?s wellness programs serve as the focal point for this research, reflecting the complex entangling of identity, history, power, and medicine that shapes the promotion of wellness and health among staff, students, and the surrounding community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet our nation?s decarbonization goals, however, technologies are needed that can leverage this renewable electricity to produce useful chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Electrochemical processes are poised to address this critical need. For example, the electrochemical splitting of water can produce green hydrogen, while the oxidation of green hydrogen can yield carbon free energy on demand.  But the viability of these processes depends on the performance and cost of catalytic materials needed for the electrochemical reactions. These catalysts are typically composed of rare and expensive metals such as platinum, palladium, and iridium. One strategy to improve the performance of these materials is to disperse the metal as individual atoms on a high surface area support.  These ?single-atom? catalysts (SACs) provide maximum metal usage efficiency and display unique catalytic properties.  But key fundamental questions remain about how these catalysts carry out electrocatalytic reactions and what their true structure is under operating conditions.  The project seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of electrochemical catalysis over SACs, and use this understanding to design new materials with improved performance and precious metal usage efficiency. The research will be integrated with educational efforts aimed at engaging students and exciting them about the role of catalysis in sustainability. <br/><br/>Currently, single-atom electrocatalysts suffer from a lack of uniformity in their active site structures.  To address that issue, the project will utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to synthesize catalysts with highly uniform catalytic active sites deposited on precisely synthesized metal oxide nanocrystalline supports.  A combination of site-specific and in situ spectroscopies will be used to understand the atomic structure of the active sites and how their structure may evolve under reaction conditions. Having identified the nature of these active sites, links will be made between their structure and catalytic behavior. These structure-property relationships will be leveraged to design catalysts with optimal activity, systematically tuning the bonding of the metal site to the oxide support. This continuous tuning will be enabled by electrochemical ion insertion into the metal oxide support. In addition to understanding how the catalytic sites respond to changes in bonding to their support, the project will further demonstrate how their properties can be controlled by changing the electrochemical medium in which they operate. The insights developed in these studies will be used to design catalysts for selective electrochemical oxidation reactions using glycerol, a major byproduct of biodiesel, as a representative substrate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multisite randomized trials, or studies in which individuals are randomized to condition within schools, are frequently used to assess the effect of these interventions. The most common question in these studies is whether or not the intervention is effective. While determining whether an intervention is effective is an important question, it does not provide a comprehensive picture of the intervention. Studies should also be designed to determine how an intervention works, or the mechanisms underlying the intervention, known as the mediation mechanisms. In addition, the effect of the mechanism may differ depending on student characteristics, school context, local implementation, or a host of other factors, known as moderated mediation. Assessing moderated mediation is critical in understanding for whom and under what contexts the intervention is effective, and why. Currently, statistical methods and tools do not exist for unpacking complex mediation mechanisms in multisite trials. The purpose of this study is to develop methods and tools to enable researchers to answer questions crucial for unpacking complex mediation mechanisms in multisite randomized trials, including (1) how the total impact of an intervention is mediated by one mediator or multiple concurrent or sequential mediators and (2) how the mechanisms vary by individual and contextual factors. These methods and tools will help researchers better understand the complex effects of interventions so that they can improve and tailor interventions to different individuals and school contexts and thus enhance educational equity.<br/><br/>This project will develop analysis procedures for multisite causal moderated mediation analysis with one mediator or multiple concurrent or sequential mediators. The identification of the causal effects relies on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, which is usually violated in real applications. Therefore, this project will also develop intuitive sensitivity analysis strategies to assess the potential influence of not only unmeasured pretreatment confounding but also posttreatment confounding. The methods will be applied to the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM) and Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) to investigate the mediation mechanisms underlying the impact of educational interventions on math performance and their heterogeneity. Comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. A user-friendly R package with a graphical interface will be developed to enable empirical researchers to generate a new set of thorough, precise, and valid empirical evidence regarding the heterogeneity of causal mediation mechanisms across individuals and contexts. The usability of the package will be tested through simulations, real data analyses, and focus groups. Courses and workshops will be offered to train diverse students and scholars to adopt the analytic framework and tools developed from this project. All the software documentation and training materials will be publicly and freely accessible. <br/><br/><br/>This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education.

This research aligns with national interests by enhancing technological capabilities, contributing to scientific progress, and potentially impacting national health and prosperity through improved computational infrastructure.<br/><br/>This initiative delves into developing a robust memory management framework for terabyte-scale, CXL-enabled tiered memory systems.  The research tackles these challenges through two main approaches: (1) An advanced page allocation mechanism that optimizes data distribution across different memory types, considering bandwidth and latency, functioning effectively without prior knowledge of application behavior. (2) A heuristic method for managing all memory pages, guided by accurate, low-overhead memory region-based profiling across the entire memory hierarchy. The proposed solution is noteworthy for its ability to address both latency and bandwidth considerations in multi-tiered memory systems, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches. The intellectual merit of this research lies in its potential to significantly enhance OS memory management and the understanding of heterogeneous memory systems. By addressing the complexities of managing diverse memory types on a large scale, the project is expected to dramatically improve the scalability and efficiency of computational infrastructures, enabling more complex data processing tasks.

These interfaces, where fluids meet, play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation, nutrient gathering, and gas exchange, offering valuable insights into microorganisms' ability to thrive in diverse conditions. Unfortunately, the interactions of bacteria with these domains are poorly understood due to the technical challenges scientists face in studying complex materials. This research aims to advance our knowledge of how interfaces influence the movement of living microorganisms. The research team utilizes ordered materials called liquid crystals, characterized by properties between liquids and solids, as a model system to study how microorganisms interact with intricate environments. Leveraging the tunable features of liquid crystals, the team explores ways to engineer the interface properties, enhancing control over bacterial flows and structural states. This work carries promising technological prospects as it opens avenues for the development of new functional systems applicable across fields including biosensing, bioremediation, and disease treatment. In addition to the technological impacts, the project is integrated with educational and outreach plans that incorporate examples of soft materials to improve the teaching of physics to life science students, create opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to experience research at an early stage, and make science enjoyable to the general public.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>Active materials are structured systems of interacting elements that propel motion and generate flows. The aspiration to regulate these flows has driven research efforts to develop functional systems applicable across various domains. This project addresses the challenge of establishing effective mechanisms to control flows in active materials. Mainly, it delves into exploring liquid crystal interfaces to govern the dynamic assembly of living active materials. The goal of this research is to deepen the understanding of how ordered materials influence the fundamental behaviors of active materials and how interfaces can be successfully designed to regulate flows within active entities. Self-propelled bacteria are utilized as a model system to investigate the impact of interfacial anisotropy and topological defects on the dynamics of active materials. Employing diverse microfabrication techniques, including lithography, 3D printing, and microfluidics, the team undertakes the confinement of liquid crystals and the engineering of their surface defects to direct the collective behavior of bacteria. The insights gained from this project contribute to the development of transformative applications with practical implications in diverse fields, especially those requiring the transformation of chaotic dynamics into useful work. The project also promotes educational opportunities by integrating education and research through the creation of opportunities for undergraduate students from nontraditional backgrounds to explore projects related to soft materials at an early stage, to prepare them for higher education and careers in STEM. In addition, the principal investigator is developing a distinct approach to improve the teaching of physics to life science students by implementing topics related to soft matter and elucidating the strong connections between physical concepts and biological systems.

With the recent ?Big Data? and ?Open Science? revolutions, scientists have shifted their focus from aggregating individual observations to aggregating massive publicly available datasets. This endeavor is premised on the hope of improving the robustness and generalizability of findings by combining information from multiple datasets. For example, combining data on rare disease outcomes across the United States can paint a more reliable picture than basing conclusions only on a small number of cases in one hospital. Similarly, combining data on disease risk factors across the United States can distinguish local from national health trends. To date, statistical approaches to these data aggregation objectives have been limited to simple settings with limited practical utility. In response to this gap, this project develops new methods for aggregating information from multiple datasets in three distinct data integration problems grounded in scientific practice. The developed approaches are intuitive, principled and robust to substantial differences between datasets, and are broadly applicable in medical, economic and social sciences, among others. Among other applications, the project will deliver new tools to extract health insights from large electronic health records databases. The project will support undergraduate and graduate student training, course development, and the recruitment and professional mentoring of under-represented minorities in statistics. Further, the project will impact STEM education through a data science teacher training program in underserved communities.<br/><br/>This project develops intuitive, principled, robust and efficient methods in three essential data integration problems: meta-analysis, model fusion and transfer learning. First, the project delivers a set of meta-analysis methods for privacy-preserving one-shot estimation and inference using a new notion of dataset similarity. The primary novelty in the approach is the joint estimation of both dataset-specific parameters and a combined parameter that bears some similarity to the classic meta-estimator. Second, the project establishes model fusion methods that learn the clustering of similar datasets. The methods? unique feature is a model fusion that dials data integration along a spectrum of more to less fusion and thereby does not force model parameters from clustered datasets to be exactly equal. Third, the project develops flexible and robust transfer learning approaches that leverage historical information for improved statistical efficiency in a target dataset of interest. An important element of these approaches is a flexible specification of the type of models fit to the source datasets. All three sets of methods place a premium on interpretability, statistical efficiency and robustness of the inferential output. The project unifies the three sets of proposed methods under a formal data integration framework formulated around two axioms of data integration. Data integration ideas pervade every field of scientific study in which data are collected, and so the research contributes to scientific endeavors in the medical, economic and social sciences, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Level 2 IUSE:EDU Engaged Student Learning project will advance professional development for novice undergraduate researchers and experienced undergraduate researchers to further support students becoming scientists. Many studies have shown that undergraduate students, including those from groups historically excluded from science, are more likely to complete a degree in science and pursue a career in STEM if they engage in a research project as college students. At Towson University, more than 30 course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been developed to engage students in research within a lab or field course. This has been particularly important for students who do not have the luxury of dedicating time to research outside of class. Many of these students would like to engage in research following the CURE, but without additional graduate students or staff to help mentor them, faculty are often not able to meet this student demand. In this project, a mentoring ecosystem will be developed wherein post-CURE undergraduate researchers interact with each other and faculty to learn together about STEM research, build their identities as scientists, and prepare for research-related pursuits after graduation. The professional development series created for faculty and students as part of this project will advance understanding of how mentoring undergraduates from many backgrounds can be accomplished effectively at an institution without Ph.D. students or dedicated mentoring staff. Results will be disseminated to other departments, colleges, and universities and will provide an important resource to improve faculty mentoring to benefit students while they are enrolled in college and beyond by providing them with the opportunity to engage in science and scientific careers.<br/><br/>This project is focused not just on best practices in mentoring approaches and supporting students but also on how faculty and near peer mentors can be part of a mentoring ecosystem that supports the success of all students in a research group regardless of their identity or background. A Community of Practice approach will be used to engage undergraduate researchers and faculty in separate communities and in a larger group for professional development activities. Creating such a mentoring ecosystem has demonstrated longer-term benefits to students pursuing scientific education and careers versus programs in which faculty are not actively engaged in student professional development. Using surveys and interviews, project participants will be assessed to measure the impact of Community of Practice activities and the mentoring ecosystem on student and faculty identities as scientists, faculty development as mentors, and students? pursuit of science careers. Project findings will provide formative feedback to further refine professional development and mentoring activities. Effective activities will be disseminated both across and beyond the Towson University context.

Beyond CO2 emissions reduction, the electrochemical approach opens the door to using electricity from wind or solar power ? thus helping to close the carbon cycle. Specifically, the project focuses on improving electrolyzer performance through better understanding of the complex chemistry occurring at the interface between the electrocatalyst and a liquid or polymer electrolyte containing mobile solvent molecules and ions.  The project will additionally enhance science and engineering education through demonstrations of solvent and ion effects in chemistry via the Horizons program and hands-on research experiences in both experiment and computational modeling through a yearly 2-day workshop for high-school students on sustainable chemical production at Clarkson University.<br/> <br/>The structure and composition of the electrode/electrolyte interface are known to dictate the activity, selectivity, and mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions. The overarching goals of this work are to i) understand quantitatively the chemical and physical interactions that drive near-surface spectator ion and solvent effects in electrocatalysis, ii) refine and benchmark a computationally tractable density functional theory (DFT) based approach to predict these effects, and iii) advance a novel electrochemical technique, developed by the investigator, to tune the electrode/electrolyte interface for enhanced electrocatalysis. To achieve these goals, the project combines DFT modeling with experiments on both well-defined, single-crystal electrodes, and on industrially relevant nanoparticle catalysts, to quantify the cation surface concentration and the effects of solvent-cation-adsorbate/surface interactions during CO2 electroreduction. With this understanding, the investigators will use a technique ? recently developed in their laboratory - to selectively ?decorate? the surface of industrially-relevant electrocatalysts with organic molecules allowing  predictive tailoring of the behavior of solvent and ions at this interface. This approach will not only yield fundamental insight into cation, pH, and solvent effects in electrocatalysis, but also generate a computationally tractable approach to accurately predict these effects. Together, those efforts will identify electrocatalyst-electrolyte combinations and organic modifiers which yield improved CO2 electroreduction performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It turns out that many fundamental problems in number theory and geometry can also be understood in terms of the long-time behavior of certain dynamical systems of algebraic origin. Furthermore, the algebraic nature of these systems makes it possible to employ tools from a wide array of mathematical disciplines for their investigation. This project aims to develop new methods in the theory of algebraic dynamical systems with the goal of resolving central questions in the fields of Diophantine approximation and surface geometry. The educational component aims at training early-career mathematicians and providing mentorship to students at all levels.  This includes a workshop geared towards training graduate students and postdocs on active research directions in dynamics, as well as outreach workshops aimed at encouraging students to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The research program has three interrelated goals.  One goal is to study the distribution of rational points near self-similar sets from the perspective of homogeneous dynamics.  The PI will also investigate limits of horocycle-invariant measures on moduli spaces of Abelian differentials, A third aim is to establish rates of mixing of geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds.

The forces that determine the time-evolution of these systems are complex, making their analysis subtle and technical.  Two fundamental questions of interest are the qualitative behavior of these systems, e.g., whether solutions have large fluctuations, and their long-time behavior, e.g., by quantifying the speed with which an invasive species overruns a new environment.  These questions are interdependent, with the latter relying on an understanding of the former.  Our ability to understand the long-time behavior of PDE, including identifying the key quantities on which each long-time outcome depends, allows us to predict the behavior of real-world systems in a way that cannot be captured purely by numerical simulation, which, by necessity, is restricted to finite time scales.  This project will develop novel methods for these goals.  Graduate and undergraduate research will be integrated into the project, training the next generation of applied mathematicians and scientists. The project also involves a summer boot camp for entering applied mathematics PhD students transitioning from adjacent, but nonmathematical, fields that shore up their mathematical reasoning (logical thinking) and technical writing skills.  Their training is impactful because these students have diverse interests (mathematical biology, machine learning, data science, PDE and numerical analysis, etc.) and go on to careers in industry, academia, and national labs.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advances in reaction-diffusion equations and collisional kinetic equations.  In the former, the project will develop a novel ""Stein's method"" approach to PDE that is based on the observation that monotonic steady states of a given PDE satisfy first order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE) and that, to show convergence of a generic solution of the PDE to such a steady state, it is enough to show that the generic solution converges to a solution of the ODE.  The research will leverage new functional inequalities and ideas in the calculus of variations.  In the latter, the project will import techniques from parabolic theory and stochastic analysis to characterize when blow-up occurs in generic domains (both with and without boundaries).  This requires the precise and quantitative understanding of the regularity of solutions near the boundary in physical space and the decay of solutions at ""large"" velocities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It presents significant challenges to the current distributed high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures since larger-scale training incurs more expensive collective communication costs for passing more significant gradient messages among nodes. A more powerful hardware platform may not necessarily help overcome this performance bottleneck, as optimized middleware supports are demanded to unleash the platform's computing capacity fully. This project aims to close the gap between the training scale and the infrastructure's capability by providing gradient-specific lossy compression techniques and an optimized GPU-aware compressor-assisted collective communication framework to reduce the gradient message sizes and improve communication performance systematically. The deliverables can help the end-users to get significantly faster training speed with preserved training accuracy. The success of this research can promote progress in both traditional AI research, such as computer vision and natural language processing, and emerging AI for Science research for domain sciences, including cosmology, X-ray imaging, and drug discovery. This project also contributes to educational and engagement activities by leveraging the research outcome to develop new curriculums and teaching tools for mentoring college students and training K-12 students in HPC and AI areas.<br/><br/>Using current collective communication libraries for large-scale distributed deep learning can yield significant communication overhead since the gradient messages are large. Applying lossy compression techniques to gradient messages could potentially reduce the communication overhead. However, several important open research questions should be investigated to ensure the performance gain: 1) Are the current lossy compressors efficient enough for gradient data? 2) How can lossy compressors efficiently integrate into a GPU-aware collective communication framework? 3) How could the GPU resources be efficiently shared among different tasks? This project addresses these questions and delivers a novel compressor-assisted GPU-aware collective communication framework for large-scale deep learning. Specifically, the team 1) investigates the efficiency of using error-bounded scientific data lossy compressors to compress gradient data and develops a new gradient compressor by leveraging the advantages of different existing compressors to achieve a better compression ratio and training accuracy; 2) designs the new compressor's GPU implementation and integrates it into the GPU-aware MPI, then optimizes the workflow to ultimately hide the gradient compressor's cost in the communication cost; 3) profiles the GPU resource utilization of both the deep learning training and the compressor-assist collective communications, and designs a new communication framework to enable task scheduling of training, compression, and collectives' computations (e.g., reduction) on the same GPU to achieve optimal resource sharing for the end-to-end deep learning training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sea ice is composed of many individual pieces and this project will study how these ice pieces break and deform. The researchers aim to create a new sea ice model to accurately model the behavior of ice pieces and use it to explain observations. This project will not only enhance our scientific knowledge but also bring real-world data analysis and modeling techniques into classrooms, train new scientists, and provide valuable opportunities for students in oceanography by organizing educational summer programs. The project's outcomes will be shared with the broader scientific community to help them learn more about sea ice and the Earth?s climate.<br/><br/>This project addresses the critical need to enhance our understanding and modeling of sea ice processes, which play a significant role in shaping our climate. Existing climate models, with their coarse resolution, oversimplify sea ice dynamics. However, when examined at smaller scales, sea ice reveals itself as a complex system of interacting ice pieces with varying sizes, thicknesses, and shapes. The primary objectives of this project are to refine the representation of small-scale sea ice processes and establish clear connections to large-scale sea ice dynamics. The study focuses on modeling the deformation and fractures of sea ice pieces through a synergistic combination of data analysis, advanced numerical modeling, and theory development. The research's innovative aspect lies in the creation of a fundamentally new sea ice model that explicitly captures the life cycle of individual sea ice pieces. Validation of the model will utilize satellite sea ice observations. This model will be used to explore how statistical characteristics of the sizes and thickness of ice pieces are influenced by their collision and deformation physics. This approach aims to discern the impact of small-scale processes, like collisions and fractures, on larger sea ice characteristics that are crucial for improving sea ice representation in climate models. This model will be publicly accessible to benefit the broader polar oceanography community. Beyond scientific advancements, the project has a significant educational component. It intends to integrate scientific data analysis and modeling techniques into graduate and undergraduate classrooms, offering a comprehensive graduate-level course on sea ice dynamics. The incorporation of contemporary research material into polar oceanography and climate dynamics classes further contributes to educational outreach. Additionally, the initiative includes an annual summer program, Data Science in Oceanography, designed to attract talented students to graduate programs in oceanography.

This project seeks to ameliorate hidden hunger through a culturally appropriate, bottom-up, circular food ecosystems approach to understand the micronutrient deficiencies throughout the food system. The prevailing top-down linear food system model limits current approaches to understanding and addressing hunger. The linear model either focuses on increasing food production (farm) or the end consumer (fork). The middle segment of the linear food system model (food processing) has limited accessibility to underserved communities. Understanding the middle segment (food processing) is important to address food and nutrition security for the sustainable transformation of food systems. This project aims to develop a circular FEAST framework through research to revive an ancient culturally appropriate Osage food via sustainable food processing to address hidden hunger at the Osage Nation. Understanding the micronutrient profiles from soil -> water -> plants -> food -> people can advance scientific insights and the interconnections of micronutrients in the food ecosystem. This fundamental understanding connecting qualitative and quantitative data will help design strategies to prevent hidden hunger in the study region: Osage (Wah-Zha-Zhe) Nation, Pawhuska, Oklahoma. <br/><br/>The FEAST Project aims to investigate sustainable food process engineering strategies to address hidden hunger and support food sovereignty in the Osage Nation via three Research Milestones (M) and three Educational Goals (EG). (M 1) To understand the specific interactions in the soil-water-plant-food-people connecting micronutrient deficiencies in the food system, and how this understanding can inform targeted interventions for the Osage Nation to address micronutrient deficiencies effectively. (M2) To address if sustainable food process engineering can be leveraged to enhance the nutrition, accessibility, and availability of a traditional food [elderberry] at the Osage Nation, by adopting a 10 step FPE (Food Process Engineering) protocol and connecting ancient food knowledge with new technology to enhance the economic development. (M 3) Co-creating a FEAST framework with layer-by-layer integration connecting circular food systems and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the Osage Nation to build resilient food and nutrition security systems. The FEAST framework can be scaled to other Tribal Nations to support food sovereignty.

It is also difficult to record neuronal activities for a long time in neural organoids. To address those challenges, in this project, a new approach will be developed to derive neural organoids that better mimic brain structures. Those improved organoids will be assembled to represent interactions between various brain regions. The second objective of this project is to incorporate tissue-like, ultra-flexible mesh electrodes into those organoids. Those mesh electrodes are known to have minimal impacts on cells and can safely monitor the electrical activities of neurons chronically. The last objective is to investigate if applying electrical stimulations to neural organoids can accelerate their maturation, which usually takes several months. Together, this project will lead to improved neural organoid models and new knowledge in human brain development. The project will also support several educational and outreach activities, including new course development, undergraduate research projects, and paid internship programs.  Highly motivated regional high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from diverse backgrounds will have opportunities to engage in stem cell research, which will facilitate the recruitment and retention of students in this exciting field.<br/><br/>Neural organoids provide a promising platform for studying brain development and diseases. However, current neural organoids are still limited by the lack of proper regionalization and electrical stimulation for functional maturation and means of chronic monitoring for developmental studies. This project aims to transcend these key limitations by developing an engineered neural organoid system that is properly regionalized and innervated with a tissue-like mesh system capable of chronic monitoring and stimulation for improved studies of circuitry development in the neocortex. The overall research goal will be accomplished through three main objectives: (1) Regionalized neural organoid that enables the thalamus-subpallium-cortex projections will be assembled by stacking - sliced thalamic organoids and sliced telencephalic organoids with dorsoventrally patterned cortex and subpallium. (2) The sliced organoids will be innervated with tissue-like, ultra-flexible mesh electrodes for forming an Engineered Assembly of Sliced Organoids (EASOs) capable of real-time feedbacking the chronic developmental state. (3) Electrical stimulators will be further integrated into the mesh system for closed-loop modulation and monitoring of the EASOs, promoting functional maturation for accelerated developmental studies.

Further, users / applications will also have options for multi-dimensional tradeoffs among performance, overhead, resource usage, and accuracy.

The theoretical framework in standard complexity theory might be insufficient to guide the investigation of these new problems. This award will provide a novel theoretical framework to steer the development of fast quantum algorithms for various new problems in quantum physics and computer science, and construct more secure quantum cryptography. Beyond technology, the award will support the (i) development of new quantum computing courses for science and engineering students that will be shared with  nearby Hispanic-serving institutions in Houston, (ii) mentoring of students from underrepresented groups through the Research Emerging Scholars Program and the Quantum Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program, and (iii) institution of a Hybrid Quantum Computing Seminar to deepen the engagement with internal and external stakeholders in the quantum computing community.<br/><br/>Quantum computing introduces many well-motivated computational tasks that ask to identify specific properties of input quantum states.

More than 2.8 million drug-resistant infections occur each year in the US, with more than 35,000 deaths despite widespread availability of antibiotics, mostly because they are not effective against drug-resistant bacteria. The likelihood of complication or death is increased for patients with weakened immune systems. The bacteria form complex structures called biofilms that protect themselves from antibiotic treatment. These biofilms are developed through a bacteria cell communication strategy called quorum sensing. This project seeks to study how quorum sensing can be tracked by an inexpensive, rapid, and flexible sensor that provides information on how quickly bacteria are growing and how fast biofilms are being developed. The sensor developed and used in this study is unique because of its flexibility and ability to measure electrical and chemical activity related to bacteria growth. The long-term research goal of this project is to make possible the fast (less than 5 minutes) determination of infection so that the correct antibiotics and dosage can be delivered at the most opportune time. Importantly, this sensing approach can also be used in other applications, like water filtering and agriculture. The educational goal of this project is to support research and graduate education for underrepresented students, especially veterans and non-traditional students. These students often face unique obstacles to participating in traditional undergraduate research experiences, such as work, family, or military commitments. This project will address these challenges through a combination of coursework, research, and workshop experiences designed to expose and engage students in new ideas and job opportunities.<br/><br/>The primary motivation for this project is the development of a strategy to quickly measure bacterial infections in chronic, non-healing wounds for the inhibition of antibiotic resistance/tolerance, which is both an important societal problem and of fundamental scientific interest. More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year in the US, with more than 35,000 deaths despite widespread availability of antibiotics in large part because they are ineffective against resistant strains and biofilms, especially but not only in immune compromised patients. The research objective of this project is to leverage concentration-dependent quorum sensing (QS) molecules to quantify key transitions in biofilm formation that relate to the progression of virulence in bacterial pathogens. This project focuses on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence, as a model system for other bacterial pathogens commonly found in chronic wounds. This project uses a nonwoven nanofiber composite electrode design in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and voltammetric experiments to quantify virulence progression via pyocyanin and 3OC12HSL (QS molecules used to mediate virulence) detection and quantification. The following scientific contributions will result from this work: 1) A directly quantifiable relationship between bacterial concentration (P. aeruginosa), QS molecule concentration (Pyocyanin and AHLs - 3OC12HSL), and stage of biofilm development; 2) Enablement of a flexible, tunable voltametric sensor that offers highly sensitive and specific electrochemical detection of redox species while being easily incorporated into wearable fabrics or wound dressings given its bio-textile design; and 3) The functionalization of nanofiber composite aptasensors, enabling generation of quantifiable electrochemical signals to greatly reduce the Limit of Detection (LOD) and improve specificity. This work addresses the critical challenge of quantifying species-specific signaling molecules associated with progression of bacterial load (bioburden). The long-term importance of this work is increased understanding of more effective treatment timing, while reducing the risk for development of drug resistance. Understanding the precise moments in which a bacterial pathogen may be advancing in virulence is important for any organism that may be infected by these bacteria, including plants, animals, and humans.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biosensing Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, convex reformulations or relaxations have gained popularity in control, thanks to advances in interior-point algorithms. While these methods often provide rigorous stability and safety certificates, their applicability tends to be limited to individual dynamic systems or centralized settings. On the other hand, the old topic of policy search for directly optimiz  to empirical successes of reinforcement learning. This class of methods is conceptually simpler, computationally more flexible, but leads to nonconvex optimization, making it harder to derive theoretical guarantees. This project will establish theoretical and algorithmic foundations for bridging convex and nonconvex optimization for a broader class of modern control systems. The outcomes will significantly broaden the optimization and control problems in societal engineering systems, including transportation, power grids, and smart buildings, facilitating efficient and reliable solutions. The project tightly integrates comprehensive educational and outreach activities. A suite of curriculum materials for control education will be developed, lowering the barrier to understanding fundamental feedback principles. The project team will lead activities in summer training camps and collaborate with well-established programs at UCSD, contributing to knowledge dissemination to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project consists of three synergistic thrusts, fully investigating the interplay between convex and nonconvex optimization for modern control. First, we will develop an innovative framework to reveal hidden convexity in nonconvex static and dynamic distributed control of networked systems. Our framework will advance closed-loop convexity, sparsity invariance, and efficient formulations of linear matrix inequalities. Second, we will establish theoretical guarantees and algorithmic foundations for nonconvex policy search. Specifically, we will develop convex lifting analysis to certify global optimality in smooth nonconvex optimal control and establish algorithmic foundations for nonsmooth and nonconvex robust control with robustness and safety requirements. Lastly, we will develop scalable convex and nonconvex optimization algorithms for large-scale systems by leveraging nonsmooth eigenvalue optimization, decomposition, and acceleration schemes. Collectively, these advances will result in new foundational theoretical frameworks and practical scalable algorithms to achieve reliable and efficient modern control of societal engineering systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They carry important information and can interact with piezoelectric substrates, which together lead to a wide range of applications including filtering, analog signal processing, and quantum acoustic devices. However, most of the SAW devices have fixed configurations and limited tunability, and their properties cannot be manipulated in real-time. Such a drawback limits the ability of current electronic devices that use SAW as a fundamental platform. It represents a major barrier to achieving smart and intelligent control of SAWs, which is a pursuit in the information era. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposal aims to overcome this technological gap by developing and optimizing tunable SAW components that go beyond passive, single-functionality devices. Specifically, it allows for convenient and reconfigurable tuning of SAWs by supplying a small gate voltage. This research will enhance the fundamental understanding of SAWs propagating on piezoelectric substrates and realize monolithic smart SAW kernels that can be applied in various scenarios to ultimately enable intelligent integrated devices for sensing, communication, and biomedical applications. The program will also help mitigate barriers to high-quality STEM education through the partnership with local community colleges. It will advance the education and research experience of students at all levels to cultivate and retain them in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop novel integrated SAW devices with expanded functionality and tunability by harnessing the electro-acoustic effects. To achieve this, theoretical and numerical models will be established to quantify the piezoelectric and electromechanical couplings from a microscopic wave-matter interaction perspective. New tuning mechanisms with gate-tunable features will be identified based on both linear and nonlinear effects arising from SAW propagation. The material, configuration, and fabrication process associated with these tuning approaches will be systematically tested and optimized with the goal of reducing the voltage requirement and response time. Experimental measurements will be performed to demonstrate tunable SAW propagation with improved performance, capacity, and bandwidth. The developed tunable SAW component will serve as a smart kernel, which will be coupled with control circuits as well as other supporting hardware to realize intelligent and multi-functional integrated on-chip devices. The applicability of the proposed approach will be validated in a number of scenarios such as reconfigurable filtering, multi-functional sensing, and programmable SAW-based particle manipulation. The research will contribute to the development of next-generation smart SAW devices by providing a powerful approach that promotes a fundamental understanding of electrically induced elasticity modulation as well as gate-tunable components that can be integrated into diverse systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This spectacular feature results from the natural occurring emissions, and their intensity depends on precipitating electrons at high latitudes, which in turn can influence energy deposition. Deposited energy can be propagated away in the form of gravity waves and can affect other latitudinal regions. Energetic particle precipitation associated with different aurora, and in particular pulsating aurora, can cause enhancements in the upper regions of the ionosphere, which absorbs high-frequency radio wave propagation. This impacts communication systems that are important for transpolar flights requiring continuous communication links to be open to the ground.  The focus of this investigation is specifically to understand pulsating aurora, which is one of the most observed auroral types.  Despite its ubiquitous occurrence, the electrodynamics of pulsating aurora have not been investigated in detail as other kinds of aurora. This investigation intends to address fundamental problems associated with the electrodynamics of a time changing system, driven by the on-and-off modulations occurring during pulsating auroral events. Educational efforts include a space science summer research experience for middle school students and establishment of a NASA Rocksat-X program for undergraduate students at Clemson University. The activities will promote collaboration between academic (Clemson University) and non-academic, non-profit organization (Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute) and community partner (Littlejohn Community Center).  <br/><br/>Enhanced electron precipitation during auroral events modifies ionospheric conductivity, and thus investigation of pulsating aurora offers an excellent opportunity to expand knowledge about electrodynamics of the high latitude regions. Two scientific questions that will be addressed as a part of this effort are (a) What is the electric field, current, and conductivity structure of pulsating aurora?  and (b) How do temporal changes in the average energy and energy flux of the pulsating aurora precipitation affect the conductivity? To address the first objective, the methodology will utilize Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar data and perform modeling investigations of pulsating aurora electrodynamics using the 3-D Geospace Environment Model of Ion-Neutral Interactions (GEMINI) ionosphere model. The GEMINI modeling simulations will be conducted on idealized pulsating aurora and actual events in which all-sky imager and PFISR data will be used to drive the model. To achieve the second goal, utilization of the Poker Flat DPS-4D Digisonde, all-sky imager observations, and deployment of high frequency (HF) radio receivers and transmitters at Poker Flat Research Range are suggested. Additionally, a new technique will be developed that will leverage HF radio wave observations at high temporal resolution to capture fast ionospheric and associated electrodynamical changes occurring during the pulsating aurora.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Aeronomy program, in the AGS Division of the GEO directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the NSF.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harnessing magnons presents an intriguing avenue for creating synthetic matter not found in nature and developing next-generation quantum devices with unprecedented functionalities. While the properties of electrons have been intensively studied, the investigation of magnons and their collective behavior in solids remains extremely limited. A promising and tunable platform to explore this direction is graphene - a sheet of carbon atoms - placed in a strong magnetic field, where magnons can be efficiently launched and detected. The primary goal of this project is to explore the possible quantum phenomena that can be engineered by using magnons as building blocks and to investigate the feasibility of utilizing magnons to probe the magnetic properties of atomically thin materials. The success of this project promises to advance the frontier of fundamental quantum science and enable innovative pathways to future quantum technologies such as ultra-low-power information devices. This project also connects materials education with the growing societal demand for quantum technology through research-informed education and outreach programs for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The exploration of correlated and topological states of charge-neutral bosons presents a compelling avenue for advancing our understanding of emergent phases of matter not found in nature and unlocking new opportunities in quantum technology. Magnons, also known as spin waves, in the quantum Hall ferromagnetic state of monolayer graphene, have recently emerged as a versatile solid-state platform for designing and probing emergent phases of bosons, owing to their extraordinary tunability, long lifetime, all-electrical generation and detection scheme and their remarkable sensitivity to the magnetic environment. However, our knowledge about the interaction between magnons and their coupling to the surrounding environments remains extremely limited. The project aims to experimentally address these key questions to facilitate future theoretical analysis and experimental development of emergent phases of magnons and a magnon-enabled spin probe. This investigation is made possible by leveraging recent advances in van der Waals assembly and moir quantum matter, along with a creative combination of quantum electronic transport and scanning probe microscopy techniques to extract transport and thermodynamics properties of magnons in ultra-high-quality graphene heterostructures. Ultimately, this project provides a new pathway for the design, construction, characterization, and manipulation of correlated and topological phases of bosons in solids and establishes a new, generic, and effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in two-dimensional materials. In addition, this project has a broader impact through research and training opportunities in quantum science for undergraduates, graduate students, and high school teachers, and a new course on two-dimensional quantum materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most studies pursue only one aspect at a time, focusing on either diversity or unity, this project moves beyond a single-edged approach to study the diversity-unity paradox in a systematic, integrative manner. By introducing the concept of ?unified diversity? to capture an organization?s capacity to elicit diverse viewpoints and perspectives while simultaneously sustaining its oneness, this project aims to clarify the construct space of unified diversity, develop an integrative research model, and identify possible management practices for enhancing unified diversity. By doing so, this project sheds light on how to harmonize diversity and unity in organizations.

Adapting to these issues, especially under a changing climate and increasingly extreme weather conditions, necessitates a shift in farming practices. A large amount of related data is being collected at different resolutions in time and space. These data range across properties and condition of soils, climate data, crop management data, crop health, different types of stresses and stressors, and water availability and consumption. More and more food production management decisions are now delegated to machine learning models and accompanying sensor networks that provide and generate diverse data across various scales. But these models and methods alone fall short in comprehensively addressing the wide range of scales, environmental variables, and local/regional variations necessary for climate-resilient adaptation and sustainable intensification of crop production systems. There is a need to integrate scientific and engineering expertise, assess a range of crop management scenarios, and develop resilience metrics to prolong the viability of non-renewable and finite water resources. This project will build research capacity for developing and refining modeling capabilities across scales, ranging from specific points to regions and from one day to a century. This information is crucial to steer adaptation strategies and assess their effects on both food production and water sustainability in the context of climate change. The project team will address this challenge by linking on- ground and remotely sensed data with a new modeling framework that is capable of generating multiple scenarios for crop production under different future climate scenarios to ensure the best set of strategies for sustainability and resilience of water resources.  The project will use field trials, novel analytics, and links between people, farms, and natural systems to help change how field crops are grown for the better. The goal is to create an all-in-one system that can better sustain water resources and manage nutrients and soils.                                            <br/><br/>The project approach is based on a strategic 5-year plan for achieving the PI?s overall career goal of integrating her research and teaching through systematic investigations of food production systems with environmental concerns by studying the connections between spatial-temporal scales and physical conditions that have impeded understanding and effective application of climate smart water management practices for crop production. This effort will require a fusion of multiscale, heterogeneous, multi-sourced, time-varying data including data from sub-surface sensors, surface data, weather forecasts, crop growth, and soil nutrients, etc.; understanding of the climate-water-crop production loop; and resilience metrics. The strategy will be pursued through the following integrated objectives (1) conduct machine learning-informed multiscale modeling of crop production systems? spatio-temporally varying responses of crop growth and hydrology; (2) investigate climate (change and extreme events) and crop management scenarios (irrigation, nutrient use, crop choice, land transition) and their impact on food production; and (3) quantify resilience metrics for the sustainability of crop production systems to guide prioritization of management measures under future climate. The education goal of this project is to engage and equip students with agroecosystem-inspired fundamental training through integration with the existing curriculum of undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning, thus strengthening their readiness to join a STEM- related workforce in data science, natural resource management, and environmental decision support and consulting. The research activities designed for the project will engage an early career faculty member and students in advancing through their careers and guiding students at different stages of education (graduate, undergraduate, and high and middle school) and engaging with rural communities through field days and educational outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the release of excess N (nitrate) from agricultural runoffs and wastewater treatment plants has also led to widespread groundwater pollution and nutrient enrichment in surface water systems, a process commonly referred to as eutrophication. In nitrogen-limited surface water systems including lakes, rivers, and estuaries, eutrophication has been shown to cause a decrease in water quality, oxygen depletion, a loss of aquatic biota, and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to explore the utilization of electrochemical refining to recover nitrate from wastewater and convert it into valuable products such as ammonia which is a critical component of  N fertilizers. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to combine and integrate chemical separations (membranes), electrocatalysis (nitrate reduction reactions), process modeling, technoeconomic analysis (TEA), and life cycle assessment (LCA) to design, develop, and optimize reaction and separation systems that can capture, concentrate, and convert nitrate from wastewater sources to high purity ammonia. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge and technology to advance the mitigation of nitrate pollution and enable a circular nitrogen economy. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student at Stanford University. <br/><br/>The management of the global nitrogen cycle has been identified as one of the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering by the US National Academy of Engineering. Electrochemical refining has emerged as a promising technology to  advance a circular nitrogen economy as it can be utilized to tune the oxidation states, transport, and conversion of nitrogen pollutants from wastewater to valuable products at potentially lower cost with reduced chemical inputs and emissions than existing commercial technologies. This CAREER project will investigate the electrochemical reduction of nitrate from wastewater to produce ammonia, a critical component of nitrogen fertilizers. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to design, synthesize, evaluate, and optimize a new family of homogenous molecular catalysts [M(DIM) catalysts, where M is a transition metal (Co, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni) at the center of a dimethyl ligand (DIM)] that could enable the rapid, selective, inexpensive, and energy-efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction to high-purity ammonia. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) design and synthesize molecular M(DIM) catalysts and elucidate their mechanisms of nitrate reduction in various wastewater matrices; 2) design and engineer extraction systems to separate the catalysts and their reaction products (ammonia) from treated wastewater; and 3) design, develop, and optimize electrically driven reactive and  separation systems that could be integrated into wastewater treatment plants to recover and convert nitrate to high-purity ammonia. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the design and development of more efficient and cost-effective wastewater treatment processes and systems to recover and convert nitrate to valuable products. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the PI proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at Stanford University to design and launch an annual Bay Area Electrochemistry (BAE) Bootcamp to train early-stage graduate students on electrochemical methods and circular water treatment applications. In addition, the PI proposes to 1) develop and implement an REU program augmented with seminars on societal equity to recruit and retain undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and 2) design and organize water-related science fair projects to engage and mentor high school students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses the question, ?Which elements of role model success stories are effective in improving equity and success in undergraduate STEM education?? In undergraduate classrooms today, most of the scientists featured do not reflect the diverse scientific community, nor do they match the identities of students reached by these resources. One way to combat this mismatch is to create new materials that highlight scientist role models with diverse backgrounds and identities. Featuring scientist role models in courses is a scalable way to promote the success of students with marginalized identities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Previous research has found that the impact of role models can depend on the ways their stories are told and shared in classroom materials. This work tests the theory that the success of scientist role models must feel within reach for students in order to create positive impacts. This project will develop and evaluate materials that combine scientist success stories with data literacy classroom exercises. The ultimate goal of this work is to give insight into how to effectively include scientist role models in instructional materials. It will also result in a new set of freely available, evidence-based, educational resources for undergraduate biology classrooms. <br/><br/>The goal of this discipline-based education research study is to understand the impacts of how scientist role models are represented in curricula. This project will introduce students to scientist role model success stories using an innovative approach that combines data literacy activities with scientist profiles. Project personnel will design new teaching materials that address scientific content and data literacy objectives appropriate for introductory undergraduate biology courses and feature the research of scientist role models who identify with genders, race/ethnicities, or abilities that are historically excluded in biology. These new resources will be based on a combination of two previously established science education programs, Data Nuggets and Project Biodiversify. Using a network of introductory biology classrooms across the country, this project will expose students to activities featuring the same data literacy instruction but to different treatments that vary in information about the attainability of the role model?s success (e.g., an emphasis on prestigious accomplishments of the scientist or an emphasis on how scientists overcame barriers encountered in their pursuit of science). Likert-scale and open-response survey items will be used to measure the effects of different treatments on 1) perceived attainability of a science career, 2) motivation to pursue a career in science, 3) interest in quantitative biology, 4) identity as scientists, 5) science self-efficacy, and 6) engagement with activities across a national sample of introductory biology classrooms.

This project addresses the question, ?Which elements of role model success stories are effective in improving equity and success in undergraduate STEM education?? In undergraduate classrooms today, most of the scientists featured do not reflect the diverse scientific community, nor do they match the identities of students reached by these resources. One way to combat this mismatch is to create new materials that highlight scientist role models with diverse backgrounds and identities. Featuring scientist role models in courses is a scalable way to promote the success of students with marginalized identities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Previous research has found that the impact of role models can depend on the ways their stories are told and shared in classroom materials. This work tests the theory that the success of scientist role models must feel within reach for students in order to create positive impacts. This project will develop and evaluate materials that combine scientist success stories with data literacy classroom exercises. The ultimate goal of this work is to give insight into how to effectively include scientist role models in instructional materials. It will also result in a new set of freely available, evidence-based, educational resources for undergraduate biology classrooms. <br/><br/>The goal of this discipline-based education research study is to understand the impacts of how scientist role models are represented in curricula. This project will introduce students to scientist role model success stories using an innovative approach that combines data literacy activities with scientist profiles. Project personnel will design new teaching materials that address scientific content and data literacy objectives appropriate for introductory undergraduate biology courses and feature the research of scientist role models who identify with genders, race/ethnicities, or abilities that are historically excluded in biology. These new resources will be based on a combination of two previously established science education programs, Data Nuggets and Project Biodiversify. Using a network of introductory biology classrooms across the country, this project will expose students to activities featuring the same data literacy instruction but to different treatments that vary in information about the attainability of the role model?s success (e.g., an emphasis on prestigious accomplishments of the scientist or an emphasis on how scientists overcame barriers encountered in their pursuit of science). Likert-scale and open-response survey items will be used to measure the effects of different treatments on 1) perceived attainability of a science career, 2) motivation to pursue a career in science, 3) interest in quantitative biology, 4) identity as scientists, 5) science self-efficacy, and 6) engagement with activities across a national sample of introductory biology classrooms.

Tribology is the science of friction and wear at the sliding contacts. Research and engineering efforts in tribology address the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying friction and wear and aim to design materials, processes, and devices such that new solutions to technological challenges become available. Advances in tribology help to reduce energy consumption by lowering friction, to prolong the lifetime, and enhance the safety of mechanical systems by reducing wear, and to decrease harmful emissions in applications from vehicles to manufacturing through the reduction of energy use. Tribology also impacts the life of humans and animals that move on earth. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Tribology is a forum to exchange results of cutting-edge research amongst an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers who are at the forefront of addressing fundamental and applied challenges in this field. This award will promote the participation of students and early-career researchers from diverse backgrounds at the GRC. <br/><br/>This subtitle, ?At the Nexus of Science, Engineering, and Sustainability,? reflects the fact that a comprehensive understanding of tribological phenomena requires multidisciplinary knowledge encompassing a range of classical fields in science and engineering; the next significant breakthroughs are likely to be found at the nexus between disciplines. Most tribologists are trained in one of these fields with an emphasis on either science or engineering and then exposed to other fields as they make transitions from schools to real-world situations. Realizing the multidisciplinary and multiscale challenges in tribology, the next significant breakthroughs are likely to be found at the nexus between disciplines. To achieve these breakthroughs, the very diverse tribology community needs to come together to learn and discover together. Therefore, the 2024 GRC on Tribology invites scientists and engineers from all disciplines to discuss and debate the forefront research questions in the field, and to share how these questions are addressed from different angles. The exchange of results and ideas is held in an informal atmosphere, starting from invited talks given by leading scientists and continuing in extended discussions around contributed posters. The scientific discussion of interplays among various mechanisms over different length scales is expected to lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of the interfacial phenomena leading to friction and wear. The 2024 GRC will provide a venue for this discussion and learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, over 30% of 3D-printed materials are discarded immediately after printing, motivating a vision of the future where 3D-printing scraps are recycled at the point of production. This research will drive a transition from a linear economy of ?print-to-landfill? to a circular economy of ?print?recycle?reprint.? To achieve this transition, novel optical recycling technologies for on-demand regeneration of 3D-printing resins are proposed. Building on recent discoveries by the research team, this project combines reversible photochemistry and nanotechnology based light delivery mechanisms to demonstrate the optical recycling of 3D-printing resins. Optically recyclable resins have potential to transform plastics processing beyond 3D printing by providing low-energy, on-demand options to regenerate chemically active polymer resins that can be reused over numerous cycles. Establishing design rules for photoresponsive polymers will further advance large-format and high-resolution patterning for applications in semiconductors, optoelectronics, and biological scaffold materials. To broaden participation in research, the PIs will recruit and train researchers from underrepresented populations including women, first-generation and low-income (FLI) students, and underrepresented minorities (URMs). Research findings will be integrated into engineering coursework, emphasizing inquiry-based approaches that will engage students in the real-world challenge of sustainable plastics manufacturing. Finally, concepts in sustainability and additive manufacturing will be explained through educational coloring book pages and ?no jargon? research highlights. Educational content will be distributed to the broader public online and at K-8 outreach events across the San Francisco Bay Area. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research is to reduce plastic waste from 3D printing processes by engineering reusable resins that can be printed, ?erased,? and re-printed over numerous cycles. The objective of this proposal is to engineer robust, modular mechanisms for optical recycling into polymer resins for 3D printing. Engineered resins comprise multi-arm polyethylene glycol with photoresponsive anthracene end groups (PEG-anthracene) and UV-emitting upconversion nanocapsules. PEG-anthracene undergoes reversible photocoupling reactions in response to different wavelengths of UV light; these reactions drive polymerization and depolymerization of PEG-anthracene networks. UV-emitting upconversion nanocapsules are activated by low-energy visible light that penetrates deeper into materials than UV light; these nanocapsules will deliver UV light needed to depolymerize 3D-printed materials. Aim 1 of this research plan will quantify the influence of polymer structure on photo-polymerization and depolymerization reaction kinetics using in situ dynamic rheology measurements and a reaction-diffusion model. It is hypothesized that polymers with fewer, shorter arms will be more amenable to optical recycling due to faster depolymerization into smaller components and lower solution viscosities. Aim 2 will identify the chemical principles underlying the stability of upconversion nanomaterials. Encapsulation screening studies will determine the core solvent and surface ligand requirements for robust stabilization of UV-emitting nanocapsules. Aim 3 will establish design rules to improve the modularity of optically recyclable polymer resins. The adoption of violet-activated photocoupling reactions will enable facile integration of next-generation resins into modern 3D printers. This work will leverage complementary expertise of the PIs in polymer engineering, rheology, optical nanomaterials, and additive manufacturing. Broader impacts from this research will include the development of new polymer processing and recycling technologies, research training and mentorship at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and deployment of educational and outreach content about plastic recycling and optical technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their exceptional electronic properties are coupled with inexpensive, low-temperature solution processing. This combination is surprising, given that defects can be introduced during film formation or through impurities. This CAREER project is motivated by the need to better understand these materials and to advance the science and technology of soft semiconductors. The key to understanding the exceptional properties of halide perovskites lies with their structural dynamics, that is, how atoms composing a material interact with one another through vibrations. Unlike conventional semiconductors, structural dynamics in halide perovskites are anharmonic, arising from long-ranged and damped nonlinear interactions in a soft lattice. This research project aims to establish fundamental concepts as to how soft semiconductors function with extreme lattice anharmonicity. The PI will investigate these materials with a combination of advanced optical and vibrational spectroscopy, coupled with computational modeling. Insights developed in this research will help to comprehend collective motions in these emerging materials and enable their customization. The educational focus of this project embraces and leverages the rise of computation for the teaching and learning of physical chemistry. Computation as a medium and approach will be incorporated into instruction, curricular and extracurricular projects, and student research. The PI will also explore the visualization and sonification of scientific data to bridge science and art, bringing this to students and the general public.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This research proposal focuses on metal halide perovskites, a relatively new class of soft semiconductors with strongly anharmonic structural dynamics in sharp contrast to conventional quasi-harmonic semiconductors. In this yet uncharted territory, we need to rethink how electronic and structural degrees of freedom couple with each other. Gaps in our understanding exist that call for basic knowledge and new concepts to fully appreciate the origin, extent, and consequence of a soft anharmonic lattice in optoelectronic materials. To bridge these gaps, the PI seeks to quantify universal lattice anharmonicity and its impact on charge carrier relaxation in halide perovskite soft semiconductors; characterize ferroelastic domain wall optoelectronics in halide perovskite soft semiconductors; and identify new two-dimensional and molecular soft semiconductors. The project features correlated spectroscopic investigations across multiple time and length scales. Terahertz frequency lattice dynamics will be probed and correlated to optical range electronic transitions as well as elastic properties in the static limit. Emphasis will be placed on distilling universal design principles from metal halide perovskites and generalizing these insights to other emerging materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials program and the Established Program toStimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collectively, those products amount to over $100B scale and produce hundreds of megatons CO2-equivalent of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The project focuses on the discovery and design of improved catalysts for these reactions, which translates to improvements in process efficiency, more favorable economics, and reduction in GHG emissions. Recently, single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have shown great promise for a number of reactions; however, conventional SAAs?which consist of one metal doped as isolated atoms into a second metal?comprise a fairly small design space, which limits our ability to tailor them for a given reaction. The project will address this limitation by employing computational and machine learning tools to theoretically screen alloy-host SAAs to identify stable and active catalysts for oxidation and alkane conversion reactions.  The most promising candidates will be synthesized, characterized, and tested experimentally, thus avoiding tedious trial-and-error catalyst design, and opening the door to widespread application of alloy-host SAAs across a broad range of chemical reactions. Educational benefits include the development of learning modules that will enhance the technical writing skills of engineering students.  <br/><br/>In this project, machine learning and density functional theory will be used to screen alloy-host SAAs to identify stable and active catalysts for oxidation and alkane conversion reactions. This will be followed by collaborative surface-science studies with well-defined materials, and finally translation of the most promising candidates to nanoparticle catalysts. Notably, alloy-host SAAs can give both facile activation of reactants and weak binding of downstream intermediates; this desirable combination of properties is not achievable by many traditional metal catalysts. Therefore, developing and applying effective design strategies for achieving both attributes, as well as stability, can aid in developing improved catalysts for a wide variety of different reactions. The learning modules that will be developed for technical writing are critical because many surveys of engineering employers have clearly shown that technical communications skills (including technical writing) are lacking in recent engineering graduates. In particular, the modules will provide multiple levels and sources of feedback on drafts of technical writing, leveraging well-established principles from research on skill improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the ocean interface, surface waves and their resulting dynamics regulate the transfers of momentum and scalars between the atmosphere and ocean and are thus fundamental in shaping the sea states and weather patterns, exerting a direct impact on many aspects of human life. Although we know surface waves must be fully integrated into weather and climate forecast models, we do not yet fully understand the fundamental processes that couple the surface waves with turbulent flows above and below the ocean surface. A better understanding of wind stress modulations by surface waves is required to reduce uncertainties and develop accurate predictive models. This project aims at advancing the current understanding of wind stress over ocean waves using combined high-resolution imaging and numerical simulations. The outcome of this work will result in tangible broader impacts and societal benefits beyond the scientific community. It will incorporate findings into educational materials for a comprehensive three-day air-sea interaction workshop.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate laboratory measurements of wind-wave interactions with a high-fidelity digital twin model of the laboratory system to develop a data-driven model for sea-surface drag. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) understand skin friction modulations induced by surface waves, (2) evaluate pressure drag through a high-fidelity digital twin model, and (3) develop a sea-state-dependent total surface drag parameterization. Laboratory measurements will provide an accurate description of surface skin friction drag but fall short when it comes to pressure forces. The digital twin model will augment the experimental setup by providing pressure forces. This integrated approach will provide unique insight into wave-induced modulations of the total wind stress (sum of tangential and pressure stresses at the air-water interface) under a range of wind-wave conditions. A data-driven sea-state-dependent surface flux parameterization will be developed by examining these modulations, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning technology.

Label-free microscopy stands out for its ability to investigate living systems by capitalizing on the inherent optical signatures of cells. This eliminates the need for staining agents, thereby preserving the natural state of biological specimens and enabling an authentic representation of dynamic cellular processes. However, the reach of current label-free techniques is hindered by a fundamental compromise between molecular sensitivity, specificity, and imaging depth. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to overcome these barriers through the development of innovative light sources, excitation methods, and algorithmic reconstruction techniques. This project will develop new fiber optic sources and imaging platforms tailored for intrinsic contrast extraction from deep within living tissues, mitigating perturbation and enhancing molecular contrast. Such advancements promise to enable breakthroughs across physics, biology, and biomedical engineering, with direct implications for the real-time exploration and diagnosis of diseases in their native environments. In addition, this project will leverage existing outreach programs at MIT to provide K-12 students and teachers with access to the micro-world and understanding of the working principles of imaging by developing LEGO-based microscope modules. The education and outreach program are designed to spark curiosity and deepen STEM literacy among students from diverse backgrounds, with particular emphasis on engaging groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. By connecting research with education, this project aims to not only expand the frontiers of label-free imaging but also to cultivate a more inclusive and well-rounded future scientific community.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to establish a research program focusing on advanced label-free imaging technologies, with the potential to enhance disease diagnosis and therapeutic assessment. Current gold-standard methods for evaluating cellular metabolism and tissue changes, including histochemistry, fluorescent antibody tags, and genetically encoded imaging probes, are fundamentally limited by their necessity to physically, chemically, or genetically alter the biosystems. Label-free nonlinear microscopy circumvents these limitations by harnessing intrinsic molecular contrast within the tissue, offering real-time metabolic and structural imaging of living tissue without modifications. However, the reach of current label-free techniques is hindered by a fundamental compromise between molecular sensitivity, specificity, and imaging depth.  This project seeks to enable transformative capabilities in label-free imaging through innovations in visible-to-SWIR (short-wavelength infrared) light generation and shaping, with three directions: (1) pioneer a high-peak-power, tunable, visible-to-SWIR fiber source for deep-tissue label-free multiplex imaging; (2) leverage ultrabroadband spectral shaping solutions; (3) optimize excitation and reconstruction for high-throughput hyperspectral label-free imaging.

Upon activation, neutrophils and platelets can stick together to form cellular aggregates that can block blood flow, just as a clump of hair clogs a drainpipe. This CAREER project will generate new knowledge on how the physical characteristics of metal oxide nanoparticles (their metal content, surface coating, and size) impact interactions with neutrophils and platelets. Dr. Bennewitz will investigate how nanoparticle design mediates cell uptake and transport, activation of neutrophils and platelets, and their downstream cell-cell interactions in static and dynamic systems. This project will lead to the creation of safer and more effective nanoparticle contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging by smarter design strategies to minimize off-target effects. The integrated education plan will target underserved students from rural, low-income, and first-generation college households in West Virginia, who are at-risk for not advancing their education. Collectively, the education plan will spark interest in STEM for all age groups from preschool to high school students in West Virginia. By combining hands-on research, experiential learning, creative integration of art and science, and exposure to real world applications in nanotechnology, imaging, and biomaterials, these outreach activities will inspire the next generation of young scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Conventional testing of novel nanoparticle contrast agents relies on evaluating off-target interactions with macrophages, disregarding neutrophils, and platelets. Activated neutrophils and platelets can form neutrophil-platelet aggregates that trigger downstream damage including release of web-like DNA fibers called neutrophil extracellular traps. Neutrophil extracellular traps provoke endothelial injury, platelet activation, and neutrophil recruitment to promote vessel blockage. Thus, there is a critical need to elucidate how nanoparticle contrast agents interact with neutrophils and platelets to maximize safety. Dr. Bennewitz?s group has shown that nanoparticle contrast agent coating and metal content modulates neutrophil function via differential release of neutrophil extracellular traps, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines. This CAREER project aims to determine how the physical characteristics of metal oxide nanoparticles used in magnetic resonance imaging mediate interactions with neutrophils and platelets in complementary systems including static in vitro assays, microfluidic chips, and a proof-of-principle mouse model. The central hypothesis is that the physical properties of nanoparticle contrast agents modulate neutrophil and platelet nanoparticle transport, cell activation, neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation, release of neutrophil extracellular traps, and thrombosis. The central hypothesis will be tested with the following research objectives: (1) Investigate metal oxide nanoparticle uptake and transport in neutrophils and platelets (2-3) Evaluate metal oxide nanoparticle-mediated neutrophil and platelet activation, aggregation, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps under static and dynamic flow conditions. This project will be transformative, as Dr. Bennewitz will be able to determine how manganese oxide nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, and conventional gadolinium chelate contrast agents impact neutrophil-platelet crosstalk, neutrophil extracellular traps, and thrombosis in vitro and in vivo to enhance contrast agent safety. The educational objectives of this CAREER project are to: (1) Host 10 rural, low-income West Virginia high school students in hands-on summer research through the Upward Bound Program. Students will be exposed to nanoparticle synthesis and incubation studies with neutrophils and platelets in static and dynamic systems. (2) Create and disseminate a Biomedical Engineering module to 4,000 middle and high school students state-wide via the West Virginia Science Public Outreach Team. Two hands-on activities will be integrated into the presentation to spark student interest in fluorescence imaging and polymer stimulus driven delivery, two key research concepts of this project. (3) Design and lead an interactive science meets art activity focused on fluorescent painting under blacklights for children aged 10 and under at the Spark! Imagination and Science Center. The education plan will cultivate interest in STEM education and careers for underserved West Virginia students and the public. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable mentoring and teaching experience via their integral roles in creating and disseminating the outreach activities which will bolster their confidence, leadership, and retention in STEM. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Nanoscale Interactions Program within CBET and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the ocean interface, surface waves and their resulting dynamics regulate the transfers of momentum and scalars between the atmosphere and ocean and are thus fundamental in shaping the sea states and weather patterns, exerting a direct impact on many aspects of human life. Although we know surface waves must be fully integrated into weather and climate forecast models, we do not yet fully understand the fundamental processes that couple the surface waves with turbulent flows above and below the ocean surface. A better understanding of wind stress modulations by surface waves is required to reduce uncertainties and develop accurate predictive models. This project aims at advancing the current understanding of wind stress over ocean waves using combined high-resolution imaging and numerical simulations. The outcome of this work will result in tangible broader impacts and societal benefits beyond the scientific community. It will incorporate findings into educational materials for a comprehensive three-day air-sea interaction workshop.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate laboratory measurements of wind-wave interactions with a high-fidelity digital twin model of the laboratory system to develop a data-driven model for sea-surface drag. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) understand skin friction modulations induced by surface waves, (2) evaluate pressure drag through a high-fidelity digital twin model, and (3) develop a sea-state-dependent total surface drag parameterization. Laboratory measurements will provide an accurate description of surface skin friction drag but fall short when it comes to pressure forces. The digital twin model will augment the experimental setup by providing pressure forces. This integrated approach will provide unique insight into wave-induced modulations of the total wind stress (sum of tangential and pressure stresses at the air-water interface) under a range of wind-wave conditions. A data-driven sea-state-dependent surface flux parameterization will be developed by examining these modulations, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning technology. The model will be tailored for large-eddy simulations of wind over ocean wavefields in strongly forced conditions. This approach is expected to significantly advance the fundamental understanding of air-sea fluxes and lead to improved parameterizations of wind stress over the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Primary producers in the ocean show rich microbial communities and may contribute to the significant role that macrophytes play in coastal communities. This project focuses on a species of canopy kelp that is a foundational species along the shores of the northeast Pacific Ocean, the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana. The research explores the role of a diverse set of microbes in association with bull kelp. Using experimental manipulations of newly isolated microbial taxa from kelp, tests of whether interactions are positive, negative, or neutral are performed. Specific assays of whether microbes provision vitamins and enhance access to nutrients are carried out, as well as tests of whether kelp exudates benefit microbial metabolism and growth. Working directly with Tribal youth through an internship program, as well as with undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate students, helps train the next generation of ocean scientists. Communication channels with Tribal and State governments inform efforts to understand kelp declines. Host-microbe interactions are a component of the persistence of ocean species and this research informs the factors that underly these relationships. <br/><br/>The advent of DNA sequencing, imaging, and other molecular approaches have revealed that many key species in the ocean are a ?holobiome?, and their fate is entwined with the microbes they host.

Experiments tracing stable nitrogen isotopes and manipulations with hosts and bacterial isolates are used to investigate possible exchanges and the currencies underlying interactions. Metabolomic, proteomic, and genomic analyses are used to quantify host-microbe interactions and linkage between taxa and their functions. Key microbial metabolisms being investigated include nutrient provisioning, vitamin synthesis, and the response to reactive oxygen species, among others.

These metasurface devices find applications across a broad spectrum of photonics. While there have been exciting advancements, metasurfaces are typically static, and their optical behavior is predetermined by the materials used and their initial design. The challenge lies in developing techniques that allow metasurfaces to have an adjustable optical response, a crucial feature for various applications. The research team is taking on this challenge by introducing a novel approach using van der Waals materials to create compact photonic devices and metasurfaces that can be tuned with electrical bias. Through a combination of computational simulations and real-world experiments, the team aims to showcase the ability to dynamically switch and tune the optical properties of these van der Waals devices and metasurfaces in the visible spectral range. This project opens up new possibilities for programmable wavefront manipulation, optical modulation, and sensing for applications both in free space and on-chip. Beyond the research, the team is committed to education and outreach. Their integrated plan involves engaging students from grades 7-12 up to the graduate level. By participating in this project, students get exposure to rapidly evolving fields such as materials science, optics, and nanotechnology, contributing to their educational journey and fostering interest in cutting-edge technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>Optical metasurfaces consist of ultrathin photonic devices that feature two-dimensional arrays of sub-wavelength nanoantennas, crafted from either plasmonic materials or dielectric materials.

While the impact of these learning-enabled medical cyber-physical systems (LE-MCPS) are revolutionizing personalized patient care and health outcomes, assuring their safety and efficacy remains a formidable challenge.  Existing model-based design paradigms for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems require an abundance of ?clean? data or high-fidelity simulators ? unfortunately, LE-MCPS do not have that luxury.  Consequently, LE-MCPS development strongly depends on experimentation to generate data for design and assurance. The ethical and economic constraints of working in safety-critical medical applications necessitate experimentation efficiency. Yet, experimental design and learning-enabled component design are often weakly coupled -- which contributes to inefficiencies, increased development costs, and increased patient risk.  This CAREER proposal aims to develop foundations and tools for assuring learning-enabled medical cyber physical systems (MCPS) by bridging-the-gap between experimentation and model-based design.  Specifically, the research focuses on leveraging model-based design techniques to address foundational challenges associated with experimental design (ante-experimentation), protocol execution (during experimentation), and system assurance (post-experimentation). The project?s broader significance will advance the state-of-the-art in medical system design, accelerate learning-enabled CPS (LE-CPS) innovation, and provide abundant interdisciplinary and use-inspired education opportunities and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop foundations and tools for assuring LE-MCPS by bridging-the-gap between experimentation and model-based design.

During experimentation, new platforms and capabilities will be realized that can support tamper-evident run-time experimental data curation for assuring LE-CPS. After experimentation, techniques that leverage historical evidence and experimental data will maximally assure LE-CPS designs. Foundations developed in the project are prospectively evaluated in industrial LE-MCPS applications.

When neurons and neuronal circuits are perturbed by trauma, growth, or disease, the activity of neurons and the release of so-called neuromodulators is affected.  However, after a delay following the perturbation, activity often is restored thanks to mechanisms triggered by changes in neural activity and/or effects of the neuromodulators.  These mechanisms are not well understood, especially not the role and mechanisms of the neuromodulators. In this project, the role that neuromodulators play in determining the constellations of proteins expressed by individual neurons will be studied, with an emphasis on proteins that constitute channels in the cell membrane of neurons and that affect neural activity.  The objective is to identify the mechanisms activated after severe perturbation of the neural network that lead to the recovery of the neurons? normal activity. For this purpose, a small neural network from crabs is used because this networks? neuronal components are few, very well known, and relatively accessible experimentally. Students of all levels (from high school to doctoral student) and diverse backgrounds will participate in a collaborative and highly interactive lab environment. <br/><br/>Neuromodulation through metabotropic receptor action is commonly thought to rapidly and transiently modify and expand the output repertoire of neurons and neuronal networks by regulating ionic currents, synapses, and transporters. In this project, the hypothesis is examined that, over long time scales (? hours), the opposite may happen: neuromodulators constrain neurons and networks into restricted regions in the parameter space that determines their activity, and this effect may hinder the neurons? plasticity and ability to recover from perturbations. By reducing the region of parameter space that neurons and networks can inhabit, neuromodulators are thought to sculpt patterns of activity required by the system to serve specific functions, analogous to what happens during development. However, this hypothesized sculpting role of neuromodulators may also limit the possible neural activity patterns needed to respond adaptively to insults, damage, or other persistent perturbations. Understanding the various mechanisms that a network can use to maintain its functional activity, or restore it after it has been perturbed, will broaden our understanding of how networks can be resilient. Here the simple, accessible and well-characterized pyloric network of the crab is used to reach a mechanistic understanding of the role of neuromodulators in defining the neuronal elements (neurons, ionic currents) that specify adult patterns of activity, and control their functional plasticity over large time scales. By using an already well-defined system and computational approaches, a relatively simple path to understanding the role of neuromodulators will be taken, which can then be applied and tested in more complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water scarcity is the defining challenge in the southwestern US, and globally, drylands cover 41% of the land surface, supporting 38% of the human population. Water is life, and the proposed region (encompassing the Navajo Nation, New Mexico, and far west Texas) has the highest household water insecurity in the nation. Approximately one-third of all Navajo families and dozens of communities near the Mexico border lack piped water or adequate sanitation. Regionally, ~78% of people rely on groundwater for drinking water, but large supplies of water are unusable without treatment, including saline water and water contaminated by industry, agriculture, and military facilities. Gaining access to clean water requires energy for hauling, piping, pumping, and cleaning it.  Innovation closing the large gap between the regional potential for clean energy and the realized capacity to meet regional needs for clean water will also address economic and climate needs by developing a broad and highly skilled workforce while transitioning to the region to clean energy. The project team will co-create solutions with underserved communities and incorporate indigenous knowledge with a holistic approach that will lead the invention and commercialization of technologies that maximize resilience and bring clean water to every tap, decarbonized power to every door, and a diverse, inclusive, and vibrant economy to the region.<br/><br/>The proposed innovation ecosystem represents a partnership of 2- and 4-year higher education institutions, national laboratories, community groups, government organizations, and both for-profit and non-profit companies in a region of exceptional cultural diversity with 48% identifying as Hispanic and 10% as Native American across 23 tribes. Communities in the region experience high economic distress, exceeding the national average of 13% living in poverty, with New Mexico (NM) and El Paso County at ~19%, and Navajo Nation at a staggering 33%. To help lift communities out of poverty and launch development of essential infrastructure, project activities are designed around holistic community-engaged projects that emphasize regional strategic economic development imperatives: alignment with stakeholders in a collective, representative ecosystem, expanded capacity for techno-economic development initiatives in rural and tribal communities, preparation of a skilled workforce to enable renewable energy transitions and solutions to water scarcity, and new bridges between industry and technological experts. Community engagement efforts will include Tribal led ?learning tours? to help ecosystem members integrate Native perspectives and knowledge into all clean water and clean energy projects. Use-inspired research efforts will develop plans for a network of integrated water/energy resilience testbeds for four topics: clean water, clean energy, integrated water/energy resilience, and maps & models of unconventional water resources. Workforce development efforts will strengthen the coalition of community colleges through shared comprehensive training programs, and entrepreneurship will be expanded by building upon programs that are tailored to meet the unique cultural needs of different communities, ensuring inclusivity and relevance.

As supplied primarily by natural gas and oil, hydrocarbons provide most of our energy needs through combustion, and also serve as the source of many manufactured products, including plastics, lubricants, fabrics, and building materials, among others.  Unfortunately, traditional high-temperature combustion and manufacturing processes are challenging to control, resulting in low energy efficiency, high emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and generation of undesired side products (the latter compounding process complexity and energy inefficiency through the need for downstream separations).  The project explores a novel electrocatalytic approach to hydrocarbon utilization that operates near room temperature and controls the elementary steps involved in incorporating oxygen atoms into hydrocarbons such that combustion efficiency is greatly improved, while chemical manufacturing of oxygen-containing hydrocarbon products can be directed more effectively to desired products, resulting in lower energy consumption. Aside from the technical benefits, the project will be complemented by efforts to make the understanding of electrochemical processes more accessible to students and the general public.  To this effect, the project includes an approach to make the behavior of electrochemical interfaces audible, thus employing these ?electrochemical sounds? as a tool to teach electrochemistry at the university and high school levels.<br/> <br/>The project is built on the observation that the origin of low efficiency and selectivity in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions derives from the vastly different conditions needed for each of the elementary steps involved in the catalytic reaction pathway.  Controlled oxidation requires substrate adsorption in the correct binding mode, oxidation of intermediates to the desired product, and product desorption without inducing further reaction. Yet, conditions favoring one step often disfavor another. The project addresses this challenge by modulating the voltage applied to the electrocatalyst in sequence with the reaction steps, thereby rearranging the electrochemical interface formed between the electrocatalyst and the electrolyte.  Independent control is thus achieved to sequentially enhance hydrocarbon adsorption, the oxidation of adsorbed compounds, and the desorption of desired products.  The efficacy of the dynamic potential modulation approach will be examined in an alkane fuel cell application and in the sustainable synthesis of oxygenated precursor chemicals for plastics.  Taken together, these efforts will open novel avenues to the efficient production of chemicals, while aiding the clean energy transition of the U.S. chemical industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

June 28th, 2024. The Loops Workshop series originated in 2002 motivated by the fact that theory was not able to explain in simple terms the coronal loop observations from missions like TRACE and SoHO. Since then, the Coronal Loops Workshop series has become a common setting for researchers to discuss in detail the basic physical processes behind the formation, evolution, and disappearance of coronal loops in solar active regions. This is a crucial discussion because it addresses one of the fundamental questions in all of space science: how the solar corona is heated to million-degree temperatures. <br/><br/>The objectives of the workshop are to discuss the past, present and future of coronal loop theories and observations, their interrelation, and to advance our overall understanding of the physical processes that determine loop properties and govern their behavior. The main topics that Loops XI will address are: high (spatial/temporal) resolution observations of coronal loops, observations and simulations of loop cooling, reconciling 0/1-D hydrodynamic and 3-D magnetohydrodynamic models and community-driven topics (e.g. plasma diagnostics, heating mechanisms and DKIST observations). The workshop has also been very supportive of the attendance and participation of students and early career post-docs. Previous awards have been used to support travel for students to present their research at the workshops. The 2024 workshop aims to broaden participation with travel support, and those recipients will have the unique experience of touring several of the solar telescopes at the Teide Observatory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the role that resettlement schools and the social and civic networks of refugee and resettled students play in the integration of youth into host societies. By examining the impacts, networks, and outcomes of students in resettlement schools within the context of state policy, this doctoral research project advances scientific knowledge of transnational educational policy for refugee youth. The research develops a social network model adaptable to other studies on migrant and refugee schooling. In the context of dropping secondary school enrollment rates of refugee students globally, a scientifically tested model addresses the education and integration needs of displaced youth worldwide. Findings will be disseminated to local stakeholders in both academic and non-academic settings. In addition to training a graduate student in the methods of empirical data collection and analysis, the research engages a historically underrepresented group in science into the research design. <br/> <br/>To measure the effects of resettlement school pedagogy and curriculum on social networks and civic practices of resettled youth the researchers will use qualitative research methods and social network analysis. Research methods for the project include participant observation, interviews, discourse analysis, and archival analysis. Specifically, the research identifies the civic practices and cultural strategies developed by students that are most effective for assimilation and their impacts on government structures and educational programs.

This enables more high-quality measurements of space plasma with cost-effective hardware.  The same optimization of electric field instruments has not been achieved, leaving a gap in our ability to observe the space environment with cost-effective spacecraft.  Accurate electric field measurements are crucial for understanding the space plasma processes, particularly at small scales.  This CAREER project seeks to narrow this gap and take a vital step in optimizing electric field instrumentation to operate on CubeSats.  Doing so allows us to step toward a future where the most fundamental physics can be thoroughly observed and studied.  The educational objectives are to develop open-source software to allow students to access and analyze data, and engage students in hardware flight-readiness testing.  This award mainly supports an early-career professor in West Virginia, an EPSCoR state.  <br/> <br/>In this study, the PI will design a CubeSat mission specifically utilizing electric field double probe instrumentation.  It will observe plasma dynamics in the Auroral Acceleration Region (AAR), a plasma region that bridges the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.  This mission will address the scientific questions: 1) What is the perpendicular spatial and temporal structure of the electric and magnetic field in the AAR?  2) What is the perpendicular spatial and temporal behavior of the electrons in the AAR?  3) How do the first two questions vary in altitude?  We will design and utilize the electric field instrument necessary to address these questions for this mission.  This design will be the first step in optimizing electric field instrumentation for small-sat technology.  This will enable the pursuit of numerous future opportunities to observe and study space physics in cost-effective ways and offer her expertise in higher-class missions that utilize electric field instruments.  Additionally, this study will expose opportunities in space science to students and provide possible gateways to career opportunities in space physics.

Despite the long history of research, understanding the mechanism and influence of nucleation on crystal structures is still challenging due to the difficulty in characterizing tiny and random phenomena at the sub-nanoscale level.  This CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to figure out how the structure of salt solutions changes as their concentration increases and how this structure affects the final crystal formation.  To overcome the challenges, a levitation technique and powerful X-ray and neutron scattering will be combined, collaborating with Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The outcomes of this study will significantly enhance our understanding of the complex process of crystallization and its impact on the final crystal structure.  This knowledge could benefit industries like pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and batteries.  Throughout the project, a consortium will be formed as an educational platform to promote diversity in the STEM field, educate young scientists and engineers, and share our findings with K-12 students, teachers, and parents in Iowa through existing outreach programs led by Iowa State University.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Nucleation dominates the subsequent crystallization, crystal growth, and the structure and properties of final crystals.  Recently, nucleation has been reported to occur in multiple steps, forming pre-nucleation clusters (PNCs).  It is apparent that PNCs play a critically important role in multi-step nucleation and the final crystal structure, yet their nature is poorly understood.  The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of complex crystallization will likely provide new opportunities to develop a method to control the nucleation and growth of desired crystal phases.  For this reason, this CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to identify the concentration-dependent structural evolution of PNCs in aqueous salt solutions and the influence of solution structure on the crystallization pathways and the final crystal structure.  The current experimental obstacles will be overcome by integrating the solution electrostatic levitator (SEL) with synchrotron X-ray scattering at Argonne National Laboratory and neutron scattering at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop a predictive framework to anticipate and control the multi-pathway and multi-step crystallization in various aqueous solutions to obtain desired microstructures in the final crystal products.  The proposed research will lead to a vertical-step advancement toward elucidating the mechanism of complex crystallization in electrolyte solutions and its influence on the final crystal structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced semiconductor packaging is increasingly an essential process to achieving the performance demands of many of the emerging applications that are now at the forefront of technological innovation?for example, fifth-generation (?5G?) wireless communication, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and machine learning, advanced sensors, and virtual/augmented reality. Currently, the United States does not have a meaningful onshore semiconductor advanced packaging manufacturing sector, as less than 3% of semiconductor advanced packaging manufacturing occurs in the United States; the nation is overwhelmingly reliant on offshore foundries, primarily in Asia. As the limits of Moore?s Law are reached and packaging becomes a more complex and important part of the semiconductor manufacturing process, this NSF Engine is positioned to capture the economic growth, drive key technological advances in a rapidly-changing sector, and secure our national defense by rooting a vital industry on American shores. In addition to the significant national impacts, the NSF Engine has the potential to create thousands of good-paying jobs in a highly dynamic and innovative technology space. The NSF Engine has already created flagship upskilling and retraining programs that have created ladders into economic opportunity for workers from all educational backgrounds. If successful, the concentration of semiconductor talent, existing physical infrastructure, and research capacity of the region could represent a key national security asset and a new force for economic prosperity in the region.<br/><br/>The broader region of service encompasses a seven-county region in Central Florida centered around Osceola County. This is a strategic location for an emerging semiconductor hub, and the NSF Engine is uniquely positioned for success in part by geography. NeoCity, the heart of the NSF Engine?s efforts, is located in one of the nation?s fastest growing metropolitan areas for STEM talent, with proximity to the Space Coast and one of the nation?s leading technical universities with a strong concentration of the nation?s semiconductor research talent, the University of Central Florida. Additionally, the NSF Engine has built a STEM-focused high school in the NeoCity Industrial Park with specific workforce tracks and internships that feed into various opportunities within the local semiconductor industry.<br/><br/>The region was also the recipient of a Build Back Better Regional Challenge award as well as significant investments from the state of Florida totaling nearly $300 million to position and scale the region?s capacity to serve as a semiconductor hub for the nation. These efforts have been led by ICAMR, Inc. (d.b.a. BRIDG), which is a non-profit public-private partnership with heavy involvement by Osceola County government, R1 academic and nonprofit research institutions (University of Central Florida, University of Florida, imec-USA), a Hispanic Serving Institution and technical community college (Valencia College), a workforce development provider (CareerSource Central Florida), economic and community development organizations (Orlando Economic Partnership, Florida High Tech Corridor), and various industry partners. Each play a significant and complementary role within the broader ecosystem.<br/><br/>Use-inspired research and translation activities by the NSF Engine, both occurring in academic labs and municipally-owned industrial fabrication facilities, stand to advance the current state of practice by advancing digital twin technology as it relates to the semiconductor industry, creating new technology for assured and secured semiconductor packaging, and developing new technologies for the implementation of vertical interconnects and interposers (e.g., through-silicon via, through-glass via, through-substrate via) that would position the NSF Engine at the leading edge of chip packaging design and manufacturing. Leading industry partners in the semiconductor sector have already initiated direct engagement with researchers to inform, test, and scale prototypes that result from research activities, further positioning the region as a central point for research talent and industry partners in the semiconductor sector to crossover and converge to ultimately produce significant advanced packaging innovation.<br/><br/>This NSF Engine ? due to a combination of intentional efforts to train a prepared workforce, unprecedented investments in physical infrastructure (including a county-owned fabrication lab), targeted economic development initiatives, and a regional concentration of experienced semiconductor research and engineering talent ? has a unique capacity and the necessary competitive advantage to succeed and thrive in a highly competitive sector and provide our nation with a key domestic supply chain resource for one of the most important technologies in the world today. It is also poised to create another vital national resource: a highly trained semiconductor workforce. Together with key partners such as Valencia College, the NSF Engine has already begun the essential work of creating pathways to high-paying jobs in the sector for residents from across the region that open opportunity and create economic stability for families up and down the economic ladder. These factors position the NSF Engine to be a powerful engine for U.S. competitiveness, economic opportunity, and advanced semiconductor packaging innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research generated by this project will reveal adaptations for maintaining this cellular complexity in a unicellular organism, which has diverged from ancestors inhabiting ponds, estuaries, and sediment surface habitats, to become a major photosynthetic planktonic species in the world?s coastal oceans with wide reaching ecological roles. This transition is even more remarkable due its precariousness - its cellular and metabolic complexity and photosynthetic capabilities are the result of stealing and repurposing cell parts and genes of its algal prey. This research will determine how this process happens, and thereby shed some light on important, yet enigmatic, evolutionary processes. The project will help to train two postdoctoral scientists and prepare them for a professional career in scientific research. The project will also train undergraduate students in the laboratory, and will engage with the Zephyr Foundation, a marine science literacy and education program, which serves regional schools (levels 6-12), including districts with predominantly underrepresented groups in sciences. The project will also engage with the public in a collaboration with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History?s Underwater Parks Day to help educate the public about the oceans? ?invisible? (i.e., microscopic) biodiversity. <br/><br/>The project will compare cellular, metabolic, and genetic adaptations across a genus of ciliates that span functional nutritional modes of heterotrophy to phototrophy, through a continuum of mixotrophy. Mixotrophy in Mesodinium is driven by organelle stealing (or kleptoplasty), which in M. chamaeleon evenly supports its nutritional and energy needs between feeding and photosynthesis. However, in M. rubrum it is more a means to steal organelles, including the active nucleus of its prey, to fully exploit its prey?s photosynthetic metabolism.

Research generated by this project will reveal adaptations for maintaining this cellular complexity in a unicellular organism, which has diverged from ancestors inhabiting ponds, estuaries, and sediment surface habitats, to become a major photosynthetic planktonic species in the world?s coastal oceans with wide reaching ecological roles. This transition is even more remarkable due its precariousness - its cellular and metabolic complexity and photosynthetic capabilities are the result of stealing and repurposing cell parts and genes of its algal prey. This research will determine how this process happens, and thereby shed some light on important, yet enigmatic, evolutionary processes. The project will help to train two postdoctoral scientists and prepare them for a professional career in scientific research. The project will also train undergraduate students in the laboratory, and will engage with the Zephyr Foundation, a marine science literacy and education program, which serves regional schools (levels 6-12), including districts with predominantly underrepresented groups in sciences. The project will also engage with the public in a collaboration with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History?s Underwater Parks Day to help educate the public about the oceans? ?invisible? (i.e., microscopic) biodiversity. <br/><br/>The project will compare cellular, metabolic, and genetic adaptations across a genus of ciliates that span functional nutritional modes of heterotrophy to phototrophy, through a continuum of mixotrophy. Mixotrophy in Mesodinium is driven by organelle stealing (or kleptoplasty), which in M. chamaeleon evenly supports its nutritional and energy needs between feeding and photosynthesis. However, in M. rubrum it is more a means to steal organelles, including the active nucleus of its prey, to fully exploit its prey?s photosynthetic metabolism. Understanding how M. rubrum has adapted to be fully reliant on stolen organelles and their metabolism for its survival is one of the main objectives of this project.

This family of compounds, based on natural products derived from grapefruit and Alaskan yellow cedar bark, is already proven to be both safer and more effective than existing commercial repellents. This family of compounds is currently produced by fermentation processes and is used as flavor/fragrance components, but it is still too expensive for consumer insect repellents. The proposal presents an existing eight-step chemical synthesis for the parent compound of the family (nootkatone), along with a plan to greatly streamline, optimize and reduce the costs associated with this synthesis. The successful completion of this project will lead to the reduction of the production costs close to the price range of other commercial insect repellents. Furthermore, this process will disrupt the flavor/fragrance market for this compound family, possibly leading to wider adoption. Two Ph.D. students will be trained in innovation and entrepreneurship by participating in the NSF I-Corps and other training activities. <br/><br/>The proposed project would enable commercialization based on the existing bench-scale synthesis by, first, greatly modifying the most expensive of the eight synthetic steps, a reaction currently thought to require a throwaway, highly expensive and strongly basic soluble catalyst system. This system would be replaced, using heterogeneous catalytic technology developed over the last 40 years, with a far cheaper catalyst that would also be easier to separate from the reaction products. This single action could in turn be applied to reduce manufacturing costs in other syntheses (e.g., pharma intermediates). In many other ways, other overly complex or expensive steps in this synthesis will be optimized to reduce reagent and solvent costs, in some cases by the use of a commercial ozonizer and chiller, by solvent substitutions, by better oxidant (ozone) control in the selective oxidation reactions, and by the reduction in solvent loadings in certain process separation steps, which will be made possible by the use of a modern automated flash chromatographic separation unit. All these modifications to the synthesis have been designed to streamline and optimize the synthesis of the compound, and to generate purer nootkatone products.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop, test, and publish a collection of Core Concept Teaching Tools (CCTTs) that teach students how to transfer their knowledge of biology core concepts across scales and sub-disciplines to understand novel and complex biological phenomena. The Vision and Change (V&C) report (AAAS, 2011) identified five core concepts in biology and called on undergraduate biology instructors to use these concepts to connect their teaching and their students? learning across biological scales and subdisciplines. The report highlighted the need to prepare undergraduate biology students to contribute to emerging interdisciplinary fields that address complex problems by building their ability to make connections across seemingly disparate pieces of information, concepts, and questions. However, currently available instructional tools primarily focus on teaching core concepts in sub-disciplinary contexts. The CCTTs developed as part of this project will address the need for instructional tools that teach students to transfer core concept knowledge across scales and subdisciplines.<br/><br/>The project will bring biology educators with expertise across scales and sub-disciplines together to participate in faculty learning communities to develop, test, and publish a collection of CCTTs in CourseSource. Each CCTT will begin with a brief narrative describing a complex biological phenomenon. The activities and questions following the narrative will be constructed using Branchaw and Cary?s Conceptual Elements Framework (2017) to guide students through the process of recognizing the core concept elements in the narrative, recalling what they have already learned about those core concept elements, and applying their prior knowledge to understand the novel phenomenon described in the narrative. Approximately 45 CCTTs will be developed, and pilot tested at diverse institutions across the nation, before they are published in CourseSource. Instructors will be able to search the CourseSource database for CCTTs by subdisciplines, core concepts, and conceptual elements, and download them for free.  The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decarbonizing process industries, especially as they relate to food, energy, and water, is of particular and timely importance. Engineers have an ever-constant mission of improving the health, safety, and robustness of these complex systems that support and improve society. However, innovation inherently increases complexity and, therefore, the efforts to solve complex and interconnected challenges, which include designing new systems and improving existing systems, rely heavily on computational modeling, simulation, and optimization-based approaches. There are two major challenges that this proposal aims to address: (1) the current performance of computational optimization approaches limits their applicability to simplified, lower-complexity problems, and (2) university engineering programs often lack cohesive computational-thinking activities throughout their curricula. Solving (1) will alleviate the current computational bottlenecks and broaden the scale and scope of complex problems that can be solved. Solving (2) will not only help train the next generation of engineers on computational modeling approaches but improve their overall problem-solving skills.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to develop scalable deterministic global optimization (DGO) algorithms and open-source software implementations by exploiting alternative stream computing architectures for parallelization, to enable the solution of higher complexity models that include first-principles models and machine learning elements involving nonlinear (partial) differential and algebraic equations. The significance of the proposed work lies in unlocking the massive parallel computing performance of graphical processing units (GPUs) for DGO with the development of a new branch-and-bound deterministic search algorithm. The result will be a significant speedup over the current state of the art, which will enable the solution of larger-scale higher-complexity problems that arise in food-energy-water (FEW) applications, among others. The first major innovation is a method for automatically generating source code representations of convex/concave relaxations of nonconvex functions in the optimization formulation, and subgradients thereof, on arbitrary domains of interest. The second major innovation is a scalable GPU-compatible parallel DGO algorithm and open-source software implementation for the guaranteed solution of nonconvex programs. This project will align the proposed research with educational activities aimed at transforming a diverse cohort of students into skilled computational thinkers. This project will support the training of students to understand the complexity of systems models from an optimization context to better understand the practicality of optimization-based approaches. This project will deliver methods, tools, and training modules to serve the immediate and future technology workforce training needs of engineering fields that will increasingly depend on optimization for innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Engine?s focus on combining advanced crop data, genetic data, climate modeling and sensor technologies will surpass the current state of practice and our current capabilities. The unique capacity of this NSF Engine and region will apply cutting-edge technologies to public crops that are critically important to the region and nation?s economy yet have had historical underinvestment. The NSF Engine team proposes using real-time decision making and advanced technologies to significantly increase the pace of innovation around crop-related decision making in the agriculture space, referring to this as ?innovating at the speed of trust.? This will have profound impacts on the nation?s ability to compete on a global stage given the critical importance of food security and sustainable agriculture. In addition to these significant national impacts, the NSF Engine also has the potential to drive regional economic impacts through working closely with Indigenous organizations, industry, and economic development leaders. The NSF Engine team aims to create a robust, multi-faceted, place-based innovation ecosystem focused on food security while unlocking economic opportunity for regional populations and communities that have been historically left behind by other emerging technologies. If successful, the innovation ecosystem driven by the NSF Engine will result in unprecedented advances in Agricultural Technology (AgTech) by driving new technologies, industry collaborations, and emerging startup companies; creating good jobs across a variety of emerging technologies; and generating greater economic opportunity and shared prosperity to all residents of North Dakota.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine will initially focus on the following topic areas related to advancing agriculture and the transition to a real-time monitoring and analysis approach: (1) novel genomics studies; (2) advanced predictive climate modeling; (3) scalable on-farm data collection management and utilization including reconfigurable agile data sensor networks; (4) communication networks, edge and cloud computing, real-time analysis of acquired data via artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a focus on last acre connectivity; and (5) diffusion of AgTech innovation through human-centered approaches. The NSF Engine is assembling a cross-sector team to collaboratively address the needs of the agricultural community and industry as the NSF Engine develops and implements advanced AgTech technologies. This approach will help retain North Dakota?s next-generation farmers and technologists as well as attracting talent regionally and nationally.<br/><br/>The North Dakota Advanced Agriculture Technology Engine led by North Dakota State University, includes an ecosystem of partners with representation from the large agricultural companies, technology companies, farmers, universities (including Tribal Colleges and Universities, and two- and four-year institutions), regional and statewide economic and workforce development organizations (including Engine core partners Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Corporation and the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber Foundation), Tribal organizations, and innovation testbeds. This diverse coalition of partners will be central to R&D, translation, and workforce development efforts.<br/><br/>The research and translation goals of the NSF Engine are to: (1) develop and leverage regional expertise to solve agricultural-related challenges aligned with the top identified topic areas; (2) launch and sustain an innovation corridor that meaningfully engages and prioritizes all in the state, including Indigenous and small-farm communities, to grow and develop early-stage technology projects; and (3) generate more substantial investments, technology development, intellectual property activity, startups, and commercial activities to accelerate AgTech. Test beds and programs from Engine core partner Grand Farm will connect innovative companies to the region?s innovation ecosystem. Collectively, these goals will enable this state to become a global leader in advanced agricultural technology innovations and in accelerating regional economic growth.<br/>The NSF Engine has the potential to better connect existing efforts and dramatically expand the pathways into emerging careers within AgTech. Partners will include state and local government officials, economic and workforce development organizations, industries, career and technical education programs, Tribal Colleges, and other universities to build training and mentorship opportunities across the state. Specific activities include train-the-trainer programs aimed at creating a new generation of STEM educators; supporting K-12 educators to link digital agricultural topics to foundational STEM classes; and programs that meet trainees where they are with equitable agriculture sector training opportunities. Workforce development activities will prioritize equitable agricultural opportunities across the region of service, including rural and tribal communities, and address industry?s current and emerging needs. Establishing a knowledge network to share and quickly disseminate learning is also a primary goal of the workforce development strategy.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has brought together a strong coalition of partners and has identified close alignment with regional assets and priorities to address food security, an issue of national importance. The inclusive, community driven approach with strong backing from cross-sector stakeholders represents a unique opportunity to build a new model for advanced AgTech development. The NSF Engine has identified critical R&D topic areas that must be advanced to drive agricultural innovations that are accessible throughout the state and across technology topic areas, namely public crops. It will support R&D and translational activities to cultivate an innovation ecosystem of tech companies that will support the nation?s transition to a more climate-resilient advanced agriculture sector, and will drive regional economic growth and opportunity. The NSF Engine?s transformative potential lies in the intentional focus on bringing tribal, rural and farming communities meaningfully into the co-creation to yield a blueprint for the future of advanced agriculture and inclusive economic development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Still, it remains difficult for people to truly grasp how actions in the present can create negative consequences for those in the distant future. Thus, motivating people to be less selfish in the present and more generous toward the future is a fundamental step in safeguarding the well-being of future generations. Exploring motivations for this kind of intergenerational selflessness via the present project has multi-faceted scientific significance, from contributing to the scientific understanding of legacy-focused thinking and its link to environmental sustainability to demonstrating the advantages of using cutting edge computational methods in social science research. Furthermore, this project informs how a deeply rooted psychological motivation?the motivation to establish a posthumous legacy?can be leveraged to promote environmental health and ensure a healthy and sustainable world that generations can enjoy for many years to come. <br/><br/>Although prior studies have demonstrated that reflecting on one?s posthumous legacy promotes concerns and behaviors related to environmental sustainability, the details of these reflections and effects remain unclear and underexplored. Across two online survey studies, the research team uses a mix of cutting-edge computational and traditional statistical techniques to illuminate what people are thinking when they report their desired posthumous legacy (Research Question 1), how these themes may differ between demographic groups (Research Question 2), and which themes are positively associated with environmental sustainability concerns and behaviors (Research Question 3). Showing how advancements in computational techniques can aid social scientific research via efficiency and scalability may inspire future researchers to adopt similar approaches. Additionally, insights gained through the project aid future researchers and public health organizations when developing/testing messages that can effectively motivate sustainability concerns and behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This diverse coalition of partners will be central to R&D, translation, and workforce development efforts.<br/><br/>The key areas identified for use-inspired R&D were shaped by extensive discussions with industry partners, National Laboratories, and Federal agencies. These areas include innovations in material sourcing and processing, alternative chemistries and next-generation battery technologies, improved metrology, battery manufacturing process innovation, material recovery and recycling, and safety and testing. All these research thrusts are aimed at developing leapfrog innovations to bolster domestic battery production and reduce dependence on non-domestic supply chains. Lithium battery production depends upon critical minerals whose domestic supply is at risk for disruption, and there are further major gaps in the processing of active materials and production of key battery components; these gaps underscore the need to develop alternative approaches, such as introduction of new and alternative materials, as well as improved metrology in production lines to reduce waste in manufacturing. Material recovery and recycling, as well as the development of alternative chemistries, can reduce the need for critical minerals and dependence on unstable foreign supply chains. Finally, with safety and testing issues critical at various levels of battery development and production, the NSF Engine will pursue a holistic design approach to improving battery system safety, with system-scale testing capabilities.<br/><br/>The Upstate New York Energy Storage Engine provides a comprehensive technology translation plan from lab to market that starts with industry-informed R&D and transitions technology development through venture launch and growth, proof-of-concept, prototyping, to pilot projects, scaling, and commercial development with external funding. Specifically, the NSF Engine will provide support for early-stage regional startups with gap grants for early development prototyping efforts, as well as for venture development needs including intellectual property. The NSF Engine will provide a comprehensive suite of regional R&D, testing, and pilot production infrastructure to support battery development at various stages. <br/><br/>The Upstate New York Energy Storage Engine has worked closely with industry partners to identify skills and training needs, and with workforce development organizations to develop a comprehensive plan for workforce development to support this important industry.

The problem of air pollution in urban areas and its uneven impacts across different socio-economic groups have been well documented. Less attention has been paid, however, to how this issue affects people?s everyday practices and experiences, especially in places where the pollution is not visible as smog. This project examines the extent to which sociodemographic variation shapes the experience of urban air pollution. Understanding more about how people behave and make decisions related to the air is vital for informing policy measures to address pollution and its impacts. Results from this project will be shared with research participants and disseminated to a wide academic and non-academic audience. Broader impacts will also include a dialog between community organizations working on urban pollution and the development of learning modules for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This ethnographic research explores how people navigate polluted air across three scales: households, localities, and the larger urban landscape. It asks: (1) How do residents of highly polluted neighborhoods think about and manage the air inside their homes and its link with the traffic-filled air beyond their windows and doorways?; (2) How do residents sense and respond to air?s varied qualities when moving along streets dense with traffic and what do controversies over traffic control measures say about different people?s perceptions of air pollution?; (3) How do flows of air and vehicles across a city shape the day-to-day experience of residents, and in what ways do various policies impact these flows? Many studies of air pollution hexplored geographic settings where smog or haze is readily apparent and impacts social perceptions of toxicity. Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews, this research will deepen understandings of whether behavioral responses to air pollution vary in contexts where it is not readily visible.

GEOS-Chem was incorporated recently (with support from NSF) as a chemical module in the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a fully coupled, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states. <br/><br/>The 11th International GEOS-Chem Meeting (IGC11) will be held on June 11-14, 2024, at Washington University in St. Louis. The funds requested by this proposal will be specifically used to provide partial travel support for PhD students, postdocs, and other early-career scientists. Travel funds will be disbursed as individual allocations on the basis of demand, merit, the nature of travel, and the promotion of diversity. The meeting is especially valuable for graduate students and postdocs contemplating academic careers because of the large participation from US university groups and the collegiality of the GEOS-Chem community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reinforcement learning, a data-driven control method that enables agents to autonomously learn desired tasks by interacting directly with the environment, has emerged as one of the predominant frameworks for this kind of real-time decision making. While reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework, it suffers fundamental challenges in its scalability and resilience. Specifically, existing methods require a vast amount of data and computational power and can be unstable in the presence of various types of errors and adversaries. These challenges are the main barriers to the wide applicability of reinforcement learning for real-world problems. This CAREER project will develop new foundations of scalable and resilient distributed reinforcement learning for real-time autonomous cooperation in open multi-agent systems. The overarching goal is to design new learning and control methods that enable agents to interact effectively in open systems, adapt gracefully in time-varying environments, and be resilient to unexpected failures and adversaries. The project will also contribute to education and workforce development by integrating the research findings with rigorous educational and outreach activities, course development, student training, and public partnerships.<br/><br/>The central idea of this project is to establish new fundamentals of two-time-scale stochastic approximation for non-monotone systems. The key approach is to leverage extrapolation techniques in optimization and singular perturbation theories in control to address the instability issues of stochastic approximation under non-monotone settings. New theoretical principles will be studied to characterize the finite-time complexity of the proposed methods. By leveraging these new results of two-time-scale stochastic approximation, this project will advance several foundational aspects of distributed learning and control in open multi-agent systems. The focus is to develop new scalable and resilient distributed multi-time-scale reinforcement learning methods that allow agents to cooperate efficiently in real-time under diverse practical considerations, including time-varying numbers of agents, unexpected failures, communication constraints, and adversaries. During the course of this project, the proposed research activities will be evaluated systematically through a series of simulations and field experiments of multi-robot navigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of algorithm auditing is to better understand the opaque inner workings of AI systems by repeatedly querying the AI system in order to interpret its external effects and impacts. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>In the three-year study, 210 high school students will directly participate in the learning of algorithm auditing. Researchers and computer science high school teachers will co-investigate students? machine-learning-powered, sensor-based applications and integrate collaborative algorithm auditing practices to examine fairness, accountability, and justice. The research will be conducted in partnership with public high school teachers from the Exploring Computer Science community and address the following questions: (a) What are high school computer science  teachers?  values and considerations of algorithmic justice in machine learning applications?, (b) How do high school computer science teachers understand and develop new understandings of algorithmic justice in machine learning applications through auditing?, What implications do teachers find in algorithm auditing for their teaching and with their students?, (c) How do high school computer science teachers integrate and support students? collaborative audits of machine learning applications in classrooms?, and (d) What are high school students? approaches and perspectives when  auditing machine learning applications? How does this affect their interests in CS and STEM careers? To answer these research questions, researchers will use a combination of observational methods, interviews and surveys to gain insights into teachers? understandings of algorithm audits, observe high school students designing and auditing machine learning applications, and examine student learning in classroom implementation of auditing activities. Previous research on algorithm auditing for non-experts, including both adults and youth, has only focused on informal settings. The insights gained about teaching and learning algorithm auditing in this school-based investigation can be extended to and inform numerous existing computing activities as well as K?12 computing curricula and teacher professional development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are the workhorses of the cell. Encoded by our genes, these tiny molecules perform many key biological functions that range from converting one chemical to another to letting cells talk to each other. Historically, it was assumed that a protein needed to fold into a specific three-dimensional shape to work properly.  However, over the last decade, it has become clear that certain protein regions play important roles without adopting a defined three-dimensional shape. These intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are found in around 70% of human proteins, yet because they don?t adopt a specific three-dimensional shape, they have been hard to study. One area that has been particularly challenging is understanding how disordered protein regions evolve. This is important because evolutionary information is critical for understanding how mutations impact protein function, for designing new bio-inspired materials, and for elucidating the fundamental principles of how cells work. This project will develop new computational methods to understand the types of features associated with evolutionary information in disordered proteins, as well as deploy a new way of doing accelerated artificial evolution in the lab to study how disordered regions change because of evolutionary pressure. In parallel, this project will also educate the next generation of scientists with a mixture of computational biology, machine learning, and computer science, enabling students to develop new methods to study IDRs. <br/><br/>This project involves the development of new computational methods to identify signatures of conservation that go beyond conventional alignment-based metrics. These tools will use IDR amino acid sequence information and use it to identify signatures of evolutionary conservation in the context of molecular interactions and environmental responsiveness, taking advantage of a previously developed approach for directed evolution (OrthoRep) to evolve disordered regions under different types of selective pressure. The aim is to study how IDR sequences change under different types of evolutionary pressure if evolutionary ?trajectories? from the same starting point travel along similar paths in sequence space, and if trajectories from different starting points end up in the same place. The overall goal is to develop accessible methods to allow other researchers to easily analyze conservation in disordered regions, while, in parallel, expanding the foundational understanding of the biophysical and physiological constraints associated with IDR evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support this key ability, the brain needs to reorganize its activity patterns depending on the current behavioral context, but we still understand little about how this functional reorganization is accomplished. This project will investigate this fundamental question by asking how multiple mouse brain regions act in concert to support task switching, a common type of flexible cognitive behavior. Beyond leading to better understanding of basic brain mechanisms, this research could inform future work that aims to treat cognitive inflexibility, which is pervasive in brain disorders like autism, schizophrenia, and dementia. The project will also have other broader societal impacts. First, it will provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate and graduate education in neuroscience. Second, it will include outreach to schoolteachers and children to raise awareness about the detriments of excessive task switching, which has vastly increased with pervasive digital technologies like smartphones and particularly affects learning in school-aged children. <br/><br/>The central goal of this proposal is to contrast two competing models of how the brain reorganizes its activity patterns task dependently: in the intracortical model, task-specific activity is fully generated within the cerebral cortex. In the external input model, extra-cortical input is required to actively reorganize cortical activity, enabling new cognitive computations. Based on preliminary studies, the hypothesis is that a loop between the prefrontal cortex, the cholinergic basal forebrain and the rest of the cortex is a key multi-region circuit that enables the generation of cortex-wide activity patterns depending on cognitive demands, compatible with the external input model. The project will use mice as the model organism due to their unique combination of sufficiently complex cognitive behavior and availability of experimental tools. It will leverage a new behavioral paradigm for head-fixed mice making navigational decisions in virtual reality, in which they switch between a simple and a complex task dozens of times within a behavioral session. This paradigm will be combined with cutting-edge genetic and optical tools to record and perturb different nodes of the hypothesized circuit loop, with cell-type and projection specificity. Further, statistical and mechanistic modeling will be employed to link neural activity patterns to task-specific behavior and extract generalizable computational principles from this specific circuit. Thus, this project will bring together recent developments in behavioral, computational, and circuit-dissection technologies to gain mechanistic insight into task switching, a canonical form of flexible cognitive behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the locomotive precursor of human bipedal locomotion, and the anatomic pathway through which this change occurred, remain poorly understood. To better assess the evolution of bipedal locomotion, changes in foot anatomy and functional capacity must be examined across a broader range of primate species. This doctoral dissertation research project uses 3D imaging methods and computer algorithms to examine foot anatomy across a range of anthropoid primate species. The data generated informs the variability of foot forms in living and extinct monkeys as well as the anatomical pathways of the locomotor transition of our ancestors. Using such methods avoids damaging rare specimens and produces a freely accessible 3D atlas of the primate foot anatomy. The project supports graduate student training and mentoring in STEM and K-12 science education activities. <br/><br/>This study documents, describes, quantifies, and compares the size, orientation, and internal architecture of the hallucal muscles across monkey species that have diverse locomotive specializations. The methods combine contrast-enhanced imaging with machine learning algorithms. The information produced allows for the development of accurate and dynamic anatomic foot models in 3D. The novel, non-destructive workflow developed in this study stands to revolutionize the ability to reconstruct musculoskeletal biomechanics in 3D in other complex anatomical systems of any vertebrate animal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Southwest (SW) region of the U.S. is changing rapidly, and like many regions around the world, is experiencing increasingly harsh climate conditions?with wide-ranging impacts, from extreme weather events that damage infrastructure and pose serious health risks to increasing water and energy insecurity that threaten economic prosperity. The SW region comprising Utah, Nevada, and Arizona is especially vulnerable due to extreme aridity and heat coupled with rapid population growth (the 2020 U.S. Census shows that Utah, Nevada, and Arizona are first, fourth, and fifth, respectively, for population growth during the period from 2010 to 2020). In fact, as rapid growth increasingly conflicts with severe water shortages, the economic development of the SW is reaching a critical threshold. For example, Phoenix presently experiences temperatures approaching 115 degrees Fahrenheit, and like surrounding cities, is frequently impacted by extreme weather, drought, and wildfires. Within the next 10 years, temperatures will rise to more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit and drought conditions will be more severe. Such conditions if unabated will threaten the vitality, livability, and economic future of the SW. <br/><br/>In addition to its focus on technical innovations, the NSF Engine will also focus on sustainability innovations in policy and governance. If successful, the NSF Engine will transform the SW region into a national innovation hub, leading not only to positive climate impacts, but also to high wage jobs, economic growth, and technology-based startups and venture capital investments. In pursuit of this vision, the NSF Engine will (1) serve as catalyst to connect and institutionalize a distributed regional sustainability innovation ecosystem ? industry, researchers, innovators, investors, decision-makers, and community leaders; (2) incentivize co-innovations in technology and governance to overcome limitations to community and economic development and facilitate just and equitable water and energy futures; (3) expand infrastructure and capacity for inclusive knowledge translation through startups and intellectual property   licensing, enabling continued and sustainable economic and population growth; and (4) prepare a diverse and highly skilled sustainability innovation workforce that creates new businesses, meets the needs of existing employers, and provides inclusive access to high-wage STEM jobs by leveraging innovations in education and training at scale.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has a region of service spanning three states?Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The scale of the challenges in the American southwest demands a coordinated approach across state boundaries. The collapse of the Colorado River water allocations and the failing energy grid system are prime examples of traditional uncoordinated approaches. The NSF Engine aims to cross disciplinary and sector boundaries to bring teams of engineers and physical scientists together with experts in policy and governance to co-innovate technology, as well as new regulatory, policy, governance, and market-based approaches for implementing technology across cities and states. The NSF Engine has an extensive network of core partners and regional stakeholders, spanning for-profit industry, entrepreneurs, state and local government, and workforce and economic development partners, with mature ties to active water-energy-carbon co-innovation, translation of innovation to practice, workforce development, and community and economic growth.<br/><br/>Informed by the current state of practice and major gaps identified by the regional ecosystem of partners, the NSF Engine will focus on three strategic priorities during the first two years of the award period?renewable energy, water capture and recycling, and carbon capture. To ensure solutions that collectively address technical, governance and policy, market, and industry demands, the NSF Engine?s organizational structure includes a governing board, external advisory board, and interrelated working groups, comprising an extensive network of public and private partners. In addition to a slate of projects already identified and ready for investment, new use-inspired R&D and translation projects will be supported through grant competitions.<br/><br/>With respect to translation of innovations to practice, the Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine?s overarching goal focuses on expanding inclusive and rapid access to knowledge translation, getting technology and governance innovations rapidly to market and practice, and connecting currently distributed resources, expertise, and programs for translation into a community of practice. To achieve its goal, the NSF Engine will support several interrelated translation support efforts: (1) translation training?the Engine will develop and facility training in translation for participants in co-innovation R&D; (2) incubators and tech transfer hubs?the Engine will formalize partnerships with Incubators to support startup formation from both university- and community-based Engine R&D and innovations; (3) venture capital (VC)?the NSF Engine will develop pathways to access VC investments in year one, through existing partners such as StartupNV and university-based funds; starting in year two, the NSF Engine will host investor pitch events bi-annually; and (4) Communities of practice?the NSF Engine will extend collaborative communities of practice to build relationships and align programs across currently decentralized networks to accelerate translation opportunities.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has engaged state and local economic and workforce development organizations, industry, and community and technical colleges that will help address workforce gaps with a portfolio of entrepreneurship, career technical, and upskilling workforce programs aligned with NSF Engine partners and designed specifically to be inclusive of underserved populations to build generational wealth in historically excluded communities. Specific activities will focus on sustainability innovation education for K-12 students; leveraging sustainability innovation career discovery technology platforms that connect jobseekers to education partners, certificate programs, and fast-track training to build skills needed to advance careers; the creation of the Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovations Certificate program, which will prepare budding entrepreneurs to accelerate ideas through startup methods focused on innovations in carbon capture and water and energy security; supporting entrepreneurs via executive-level internships; and developing a full pipeline of workers via technical and university pathways.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has brought together a strong coalition of partners and stakeholders and has demonstrated a strong alignment with regional assets, investments, and priorities. The NSF Engine has identified critical R&D topic areas that must be advanced to drive sustainability innovations in water-energy-carbon co-innovation. It will support R&D, translation of innovation, and workforce development activities to cultivate a thriving regional innovation ecosystem of tech companies, researchers, innovators, investors, decision-makers, and community and industry leaders, that will transform the southwest into a national hub for innovation. The Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine will drive economic growth through job creation and training opportunities in the sustainability sector, particularly for historically underserved and/or rural communities, across the southwest region of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a two-tiered system, FIERCE will develop the scaffolding for the following underlying program focus areas: Use-inspired Research and Development, Translation of Innovations to Practice, Workforce Development, Ecosystem Partnerships, and Indigenous Innovations. Use-inspired research projects within FIERCE will be used to develop solutions and tools for measuring and verifying their effectiveness to ensure they reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases. FIERCE will engage with all citizens to strengthen existing and create new distributed workforce development programs, especially in Indigenous communities who, as holders of large tracts of sovereign lands in the West, are essential partners to a climate-smart future beginning in the region. Finally, FIERCE will translate innovations to practice through strategic partnerships with regional economic development organizations, entrepreneurs, state agencies, and climate-smart incubators.<br/><br/>Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from a fossil-fuel-based economy have caused a dangerous increase in global temperatures causing megafires and megadroughts that have impacted community infrastructure, food and fiber availability, water quality and quantity, and human health. Climate-smart solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and increase regional climate adaptation while maintaining or increasing economic output are required to solve these destructive problems. The FIERCE engine will research, develop, identify, and translate climate-smart solutions and products through a unique ecosystem of agricultural, forestry, energy, educational, and business development partners in the region. In the development phase, FIERCE will strengthen existing partnerships and build new relationships with direct funding sources that can infuse capital and invest long-term in the FIERCE Engine. Working groups for each of the FIERCE focal areas will convene to identify, synthesize, and prioritize regional projects and ideas for FIERCE to support in the growth phase. Outcomes of this work will generate publications and reports that will be used to guide further Engine development, strengthened partnerships committed to the climate change and societal goals underlying the FIERCE vision, and the foundation for a resilient ecosystem that fosters creativity, inclusion, and economically-viable solutions to climate change. This Development Award will enable the team to engage in a regional, collaborative planning process to prepare a future Engine to meet these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon is essential for the development and health of all organisms. The PI uses yeast cells as a model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying gradient sensing, which are thought to be broadly applicable to cells in more complex organisms. In previous studies, he discovered a ?gradient tracking machine? that cells must assemble before they are able to sense the direction of the chemical source. In this investigation, he will continue to investigate how this machine functions to decode chemical gradients. During this project period, the PI and his senior research specialist will mentor select biology students from the City Colleges of Chicago, to enhance their chances of graduating from a four-year institution with a BS in a STEM field. The proposed undergraduate research and mentoring program is designed to inspire, instruct, advise, and support students who are interested in a STEM career. Two outstanding candidates will be chosen to participate each year based on their academic potential and motivation to pursue a STEM major at a four-year institution. By participating in regular tutoring sessions, paid summer research internships in the PI?s lab, and public outreach events, students will gain experience conducting scientific research, an ability to critically evaluate the research of others, and practice presenting their work. This program is expected to increase the chances of eight students to succeed as science majors at four-year institutions. The investigation will also provide the PI's students with interdisciplinary training through interactions with collaborators who are experts in interdisciplinary scientific areas.<br/><br/>The best-known gradient-stimulated cellular outputs, chemotaxis (directed cell movement), and chemotropism (directed cell growth), are required for a wide range of biological processes. Although they ultimately exhibit quite different behavior, chemotactic and chemotropic cells face similar challenges: the responding cell must sense small differences in chemical concentration across its surface, determine the direction of the gradient source, and polarize its cytoskeleton toward it. The mating response of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is chemotropic: mating cells interpret complex pheromone gradients and polarize their growth in the direction of the closest partner. Like many chemosensing cells, yeasts use G protein-coupled receptors to detect chemoattractant. The goal of this project is to understand how yeast cells accurately sense direction in shallow, complex, and dynamic pheromone gradients. Based on discoveries made in a previous project, the PI published a deterministic model of gradient sensing that explains, in broad terms, how yeast cells translate a vanishingly small differential of activated receptors across their surfaces into accurate and robust directional responses. Mating yeast initially ignore the pheromone gradient, as they first colocalize signaling, polarity, and trafficking proteins to the default polarity site they use for budding, building a ?gradient tracking machine? (GTM). Once assembled, the GTM moves along the plasma membrane to the point of maximal pheromone concentration, where it marks the chemotropic site used for mating. The primary negative regulator of G-protein signaling, the RGS protein Sst2, is essential for this process, and phosphorylation of one of the G-protein subunits (Gbetagamma)plays a critical role. The priorities of this investigation are to learn how Sst2 is controlled in space and time, how the phosphorylation of the G protein subunit contributes to gradient tracking, and how dynamic intercommunication between GTMs enables mating partners to orient toward a common fusion site. These questions will be answered using imaging, genetic, biochemical, proteomic, and computational approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process requires exquisite control of gene expression. Enhancers are the primary units of gene control in mammals and often activate genes across vast genomic distances, thus, an understanding of 3D genome structure is needed to understand the action of enhancers.  This project will investigate the regulation of 3D genome structure through the study of protein-mediated loops and domains termed Topologically Associating Domains (TADs).  A major focus will be to integrate the proposed research into a class that the investigator teaches, in which students will build their own microscopes and study DNA looping.  Outreach efforts to high school students and undergraduates will also be conducted. Additionally, the technological developments pioneered by this proposal will be openly shared with the scientific community. <br/><br/>An understanding of dynamic genome topology is needed for understanding the regulation of gene expression.  At the 3D genome scale relevant to enhancers, the proteins CTCF and cohesin fold mammalian genomes into loops and domains termed Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). Cohesin extrudes loops until it is blocked by CTCF, which then holds together a TAD. To better understand TADs, the proposed work will visualize TADs and CTCF loops directly in living cells and quantify their dynamics, loop lifetime, and looped fraction. An integrated approach that combines genome-editing, perturbation experiments, super-resolution live-cell imaging of CTCF/cohesin loops, 3D genomics, and integrative 3D polymer modeling will be used to address three key mechanistic questions related to the formation and regulation of TADs and loops. The investigators will explore how adjacent TADs form nested structures and higher-order interactions; how cohesin abundance and residence time controls TAD and loop formation and whether active transcription regulates TADs and loops positively or negatively.  These measurements will provide quantitative and mechanistic information on TAD and loop formation in living cells, which will improve current understanding of 3D genome architecture and associated modulation during gene expression.<br/><br/>This award is funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Centered in the ?textile belt? of North Carolina, the NSF Engine aims to disrupt and revolutionize the $96B textile industry. Textiles are ubiquitous. If successful, the innovation ecosystem driven by the NSF Engine will result in unprecedented advances in, for example, smart textiles and wearable tech to textiles being used in innovative ways for protection or in the medical field. While other regions of the US have lost textile jobs, this region?s textile jobs have stabilized and the region boasts the largest concentration of textile workers in the US with over 27,000 workers and an additional 30,000 in adjacent industries such as waste streams and furniture workers, spanning almost 2,000 companies. The NSF Engine is led by The Industrial Commons, a non-profit   with a strong reputation within the textile sector as well as other fields for being a hub of regional, rural innovation with deep local, national, and sectoral knowledge and relationships. North Carolina State University?s (NCSU?s) Wilson College of Textiles (WCOT) is leading the NSF Engine?s research and development (R&D) innovations. The NSF Engine also includes partnerships across community colleges, manufacturers, brands, economic development, and state government, among others. The team is thus poised with the infrastructure and ties to rapidly develop, revitalize, and scale a cutting edge and environmentally sustainable textile industry that can be competitive in the global economy. <br/><br/>Circularity is the pinnacle in terms of sustainability and the NSF Engine will push industry toward it, building replicable systems and innovations to capture and process post-consumer waste at scale, and process it into the building blocks that can become fibers for new textiles. At the same time, the NSF Engine is looking toward immediate impact by taking a broader approach that focuses on all aspects of the sustainability ecosystem. This includes an emphasis on designing for end of life, increasing durability of products, expanding repair capabilities to keep products in use and developing better systems and processes for textile reclamation. The NSF Engine will also focus on increased consumer education and increased re-use of materials including additional material from the landfill and toward downcycling options such as production of nonwovens. The NSF Engine will research and advance additive chemistries, new materials, manufacturing and operations, and chemical and mechanical recycling. The NSF Engine will also be forward-looking with textile applications in, for example, fiber-based materials used in wind turbine blades or health monitoring of roadways, bridges, and structural components; nanofibers used in battery components such as the separators, anodes and cathodes to improve storage performance; and geotextiles used in hardscape and landscape applications to prevent pests from accessing crops without compromising water and light penetration. Last, the NSF Engine will also seek opportunities to both develop and inform policy, standards, and labeling that create clear definitions for textile circularity and sustainability, while facilitating broader understanding of advanced and sustainable materials.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has a region of service that encompasses the local textile supply chain covering central and western North Carolina, and stretching into the Appalachian regions of upstate South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southern VA. The NSF Engine has a strong foundation in inclusive economic development and workforce development through its lead organization, which founds and scales employee-owned social enterprises and industrial cooperatives and supports frontline workers to build a new southern working class. NCSU?s WCOT, an international leader in textile innovation, will drive R&D together with other academic institutions. The NSF Engine?s translation of R&D to products is built on partnerships such as the Manufacturing Solutions Center?which supports U.S. manufacturers through, for example, a business incubator and will be providing product testing, prototyping, and sourcing; Bear Fiber?the nation?s first processor and manufacturer of American grown textile-grade hemp fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel; and capital access and venture capital development such as the state-level foundation, NC IDEA. Leading the workforce development efforts, together with other community colleges and manufacturers, is Gaston College?s Textile Technology Center, which will provide, for example, testing, rapid prototyping, and will develop better equipment and measurements for biodegradation testing and overall sustainable fiber life cycle testing. The NSF Engine is further supported by North Carolina?s Department of Commerce and North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, will be leading the NSF Engine?s evaluation efforts, leveraging its expertise in technology-based regional economic development.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine is deeply committed to ensuring accessibility to well-paying, quality jobs for all communities in the region of service and to preparing the region?s existing and future workforce for the innovations to come in sustainable textiles. The NSF Engine?s workforce development efforts involve creating new curricula and certificates at the partnering community colleges focused on the NSF Engine?s topic, growing apprenticeship and internship opportunities for high school and community college students within the range of textile manufacturing companies in the region, and increasing worker diversity, worker voice, and agency. For example, partnering with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, the NSF Engine plans to establish a formal textile career pathway. The NSF Engine will also continue to expand partnerships with workforce development entities including state and government institutions and job pipeline programs, such as the county health departments, many of which are investing opioid settlement funds into programs and strategies that create new career pathways . It will additionally build partnerships with organizations that provide wrap-around services that address barriers to employment in order to create resources for manufacturers to navigate these processes, update internal policies and more quickly hire veterans, immigrant workers or returning citizens as well as sharing wage scales, communicating with all employees the opportunities to advance within their workplace. It also plans to establish ?Job Quality Standards? to hold employers accountable to health and safety standards, as has been successful in the Carolina Textile District.<br/><br/>This region has deep roots in the textile industry, with over one hundred years of experience, together with a density of companies, textile workers, and R&D expertise that can drive forward innovation, making this NSF Engine the prime location in the US to revitalize this industry and build a textile-focused, environmentally sustainable innovation ecosystem. The assembled starting coalition includes a well-established group of leaders, connectors, innovators, and doers in the textile sector, all driven by the goal of inclusive economic development that will bring with it new jobs, opportunities, and economic prosperity for the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely prevalent in natural systems like DNA, proteins, and beetle shells. It is also of vital importance in diverse fields such as chiral mechanical and optical structures, bioseparation, and pharmaceuticals. Current exploration of chiral structures mostly involves molecular design and self-assembly of low mechanical strength organic materials. However, the kind of hybrid organic/inorganic materials with superior properties required for engineering applications are plagued by significant knowledge gaps in terms of synthesizing these materials. With this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Matter Physics program, both in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator and her research group at the University of North Texas investigate new strategies for developing chiral hybrid materials by using abundant chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) as templates for nucleation and growth of these hybrid organic/inorganic materials. This is an integrated education-research program that centers on a fundamental understanding of the chemical reactions, physical behavior, and structural engineering involved in transforming LC morphologies into hybrid or fully inorganic materials; and revealing underlying structure-property relationships to unlock chirality-endowed multidimensional structures, as well as potentially novel optical and mechanical properties. The project promotes STEM education in soft-matter science and engineering, with a particular emphasis on engaging female and Hispanic students. By creating summer research opportunities, workshops and outreach activities, the principal investigator strives to include, inspire, and empower students from underrepresented groups, kindling their interests and participation in materials science. Activities are specifically designed to educate a new generation of scientists and engineers who better reflect the diversity of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and to build a nationally-recognized soft-matter program in North Texas and beyond. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Chiral nematic or cholesteric phases in liquid crystals (LCs) exhibit asymmetrical packing of molecules, and thereby result in a finite twist angle between adjacent molecules and long-range chiral ordering similar to helical superstructures in DNA. The increase in chirality leads to the formation of 3D cubic symmetry, known as blue phases (BPs), that consist of double-twisted cylinders. The chiral properties of LCs (from nano to micrometers) are widely used in display technologies, electro-optics, and sensors. However, exploiting the full potential of such beneficial chiral structures to adapt to diverse engineering conditions, e.g., temperature, stress, and chemical environments, needs to overcome the inherently mechanically weak nature of LCs. In particular, the rapidly growing market for miniaturized device technologies requires materials with integrated flexibility and optical and mechanical performance at micro/nanoscale precision, all of which put CLCs in a more unique position than conventional solid crystalline materials. In this CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Matter Physics program, both in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator and her research group study novel reaction mechanisms facilitated by 2D/3D chiral templates to synthesize hybrid organic/inorganic materials with chirality across disparate length scales. The functional polar groups in mesogenic monomers used for LC structure polymerization serve as reactive moieties for sequential infiltration synthesis of metal oxides. The helical hierarchical and 3D lattice structures formed by highly chiral LCs, including BPs, guide the diffusion, nucleation, and growth of organometallic precursors inside the templates. By combining advanced experimental techniques and computational modeling, the research advances the fundamental understanding of thermodynamics, transport, and site selectivity of inorganic species in CLCs. Furthermore, the principal investigator studies the interplay among molecular architecture, synergistic self-assembly, and spatially controlled nucleation and growth of organic/inorganic species within complex multidimensional CLC/BP structures. This fundamental understanding allows the rational design of chiral-structured metal oxide-reinforced LC composites and unlocks their full potential in diverse application fields that include chiral optics, chiral mechanical devices, asymmetric catalysis, chiral separation and sensors<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin ? with several anchor points including Chicago, Cleveland, and Milwaukee as priority areas of impact for the first two years. The NSF Engine will be led by Current Innovation NFP, a U.S.-based non-profit. The NSF Engine builds a strong ecosystem including core partners with representation from the manufacturing and energy sectors, national labs and universities (including public and private four-year institutions and two-year institutions), economic and workforce development organizations, entrepreneurship support organizations, non-profits, philanthropies and investment firms that are essential to the NSF Engine?s success. This diverse coalition of partners will be central to R&D, translation, and workforce development efforts.<br/><br/>The vision of the NSF Engine is to transform ?waste to wealth and health? in the context of water quality. Specifically, this means recovering energy, nutrients, freshwater, and critical minerals from water and wastewater for economic value and removing emerging contaminants such as PFAS? widely used chemicals that break down very slowly over time and have been linked to harmful health effects in human and animals?  from water to protect human health. The NSF Engine has three core functional areas: (1) Use-Inspired Research and Development (R&D); (2) Translations and Partnerships (Translation); and (3) Inclusive Ecosystems (Ecosystems), each of which inherently addresses one or more key barriers that must be overcome to realize the vision.<br/><br/>The Great Lakes Water Innovation Engine?s R&D and translation efforts will focus on the following challenges: Challenge 1 will lead to novel material platforms for efficient and selective separation of valuable resources and contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS) from wastewater and associated waste streams; Challenge 2 will result in emerging process technologies to advance recovery of energy and critical minerals from various water sources; and Challenge 3 will deliver sensors and sensor networks for real-time sensing, monitoring, and detection to support sustainable and economically viable processes needed in the first two challenges. Built on the NSF Engine?s strong and evolving partnerships across academia, government, and end users in industry and utilities, this NSF Engine aims to develop intelligent water resource recovery systems testbeds at multiple scales (bench, pilot, and full) to demonstrate, integrate, and deploy these novel technologies to support sustainable water-intensive industry that is growing in this region. The NSF Engine also aims to develop domestic supply chains for materials essential to growing industries like battery production and electrification.<br/><br/>Recognizing the relatively undefined and immature nature of the markets for water resource recovery and circular water economy technologies, the NSF Engine centers the workforce development efforts around training and education programs aimed at preparing future innovators, workers, and entrepreneurs in the emerging space of a circular water economy. The NSF Engine will leverage the Inclusive Ecosystem Work Group, which engages more than a dozen regional foundations, family offices, community organizations and nonprofits with workforce development and entrepreneurship investment priorities, as a governing body to create and implement a workforce development and STEM education strategy that aligns with the NSF Engine?s technical goals. Specific activities include developing new K-12 curriculum, pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships, job/skills training programs, higher education curriculum, or other needs as the NSF Engine?s initial and continuous gap analysis concludes.<br/><br/>This NSF Engine brings together a strong coalition of partners and core functions that are in excellent alignment with regional assets and priorities.

Many hypotheses regarding the origin of hominin bipedalism (walking on two legs), one of the earliest defining features of the human lineage, involve a phase of plasticity. This doctoral dissertation project examines the role of plasticity in primate locomotor specializations to advance knowledge about human bipedalism by placing humans within a broader primate context.

The first objective is to investigate the relationship between plasticity and evolvability of limb bones in reference to the locomotor repertoire of 15 primate species. The investigators collect and analyze 3D landmark data from limb bones across humans, apes, and monkeys with varying degrees of specialization. For the second objective, a robotic simulation approach is used to model how plasticity of locomotor repertoire can result in the origin of novel behaviors, as well as impact fitness and extinction risk. Robotic models based on six modern primate species and four hominin fossil species are run through a series of simulated environments. The algorithm for these simulations links two different forms of robotic modeling ? evolutionary and developmental ? which can be applied to other instances of adaptive plasticity in primates and made available for other researchers to use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective tracking of these inflammatory processes in real time is challenging because the chemical environment in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is difficult to access and sample. Moreover, many key mediators of inflammatory diseases are extremely short-lived in the body. Profiling these short-lived biomolecules that mediate disease and response to medicine would enhance our ability to diagnose, monitor, treat, and prevent GI disorders. The current gold standard for monitoring the GI tract relies on invasive endoscopic biospies or non-real-time stool analysis. Commercial diagnostic pills such as the video capsule endoscopy provide a non-invasive real-time alternative as a powerful technology. However, electronic-only systems are functionally limited since they cannot directly monitor the gut chemical environment. This project aims to develop inexpensive and non-invasive miniaturized ingestible sensors that tap into the biochemical in-body domain to surpass the limited accuracy of existing methods. The proposed secure hybrid bio-electronic sensors will enable real-time and accurate tracking of disease progression in a home setting while protecting confidential medical information. Beyond healthcare, this platform technology has transformative potential for addressing broader societal challenges. It can provide an unprecedented tool for gaining insights into internal bodily events, facilitating early detection of water contamination crises, and supporting sustainable manufacturing practices. Furthermore, the program integrates education into its core mission. Students from K-12 to graduate levels will be exposed and trained to develop semiconductor-enabled platforms that interface with other diverse fields, such as Biomedical Engineering. By transcending traditional Electrical Engineering disciplines and fostering interdisciplinary learning, the program aims to cultivate a diverse and globally competitive semiconductor workforce. <br/><br/>This project will create the first-of-its-kind secure hybrid bio-electronic sensors, thereby establishing the field of Cyber-Secure Biological Systems (CSBS), for accurate, reliable, and safe real-time in-body monitoring.

The core intellectual contributions of this program are to: 1) create a novel secure miniaturized ingestible capsule that measures extremely short-lived disease biomarkers in the GI tract, 2) design effective information transfer mechanisms to couple bacterial-cell sensors with integrated electronics under tight constraints of power and size, 3) develop an ultra-low-power multi-modal sensor integrated circuit for cross-validation of biomarker detection to achieve high accuracy, 4) self-power these hybrid bio-electronic sensors by harvesting energy in the GI environment, and 5) develop a physical-layer security design and evaluation framework for the resource-constrained sensors, including the first open-source library of analog/radio-frequency (RF) security primitives and a dynamically-adaptive security protocol to minimize the security overhead. The new field of CSBS, tightly coupling semiconductor-enabled platforms with synthetic biology for accurate real-time monitoring and control, has the potential for significantly transforming research in medicine and environmental science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Engine will increase the competitiveness of Paso del Norte small and medium manufacturers (SMMs) in A&D markets by creating an innovation platform that combines an emerging digital engineering paradigm, skilled workforce development, and other resources to reduce costs for startups and SMMs while increasing access to cutting-edge design and testing tools needed to spur growth. The NSF Engine re-imagines the Paso del Norte region as an advanced manufacturing and knowledge-based economy that increases the share of jobs in advanced industries in the region from 3.2% to 25%. This can be accomplished by redeploying local manufacturing capabilities to support U.S. A&D industries and upskilling the local talent workforce and expanding access for K-12 students to next-generation STEM skills so that more people in the region have a path to the middle class.<br/><br/>SMMs remain extraordinarily critical to maintaining a vibrant and secure U.S. A&D supply chain, but fewer and fewer SMMs are participating in the defense industrial base. Because they often have a smaller workforce, limited resources, and no budget or infrastructure for research and development, SMMs are increasingly excluded from the highly stratified U.S. innovation ecosystem. The NSF Engine is tackling the national challenge of reinvigorating the once vital manufacturing base of the U.S. economy and increasing economic mobility and workforce participation in the Paso del Norte region through the creation of innovation sector jobs. Five of 14 defense critical technologies identified by the U.S. Department of Defense are included in the ecosystem: advanced materials; trusted AI and autonomy; space technology; renewable energy generation and storage; and hypersonics.<br/><br/>Paso del Norte is an eight-county region that sits on the U.S.-Mexico border in the American Southwest. It includes six counties in West Texas and two in Southern New Mexico. The cities of El Paso and Las Cruces are the largest metropolitan areas in the region of service. The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) designates six of the eight counties (Culberson, Doa Ana, El Paso, Hudspeth, Presidio, and Sierra) as Persistent Poverty Counties, meaning that poverty rates have stayed above 20 percent for at least 30 years. The median income for families in this region is well below the national average and this gap has widened since 1997.<br/><br/>One reason for low incomes is the lack of high-paying STEM jobs in the region, relative to other markets. To revitalize the US A&D industrial base and propel the Paso del Norte region toward more economic parity and increased competitiveness, the NSF Engine will help SMMs to develop more innovation in their approaches and gain affordable access to defense-critical research and development. Some of the key components of the NSF Engine are new open-access physical and technical support infrastructures based at universities and facilities in the region that SMMs can utilize to build their innovation capacity and workforce talent.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine?s Public Innovation Architecture will be an ecosystem that fosters engineering and manufacturing innovation to speed the development of capabilities among regional SMMs to access use-inspired R&D. This Public Innovation Architecture is a way to disrupt the traditional R&D process by ensuring broad and affordable access to innovation processes. The Public Innovation Infrastructure will be a combination of resources to develop hard and soft infrastructure, which includes expanding the available local skilled workforce, physical infrastructure in El Paso for SMMs, digital infrastructure that can be accessed throughout the region, and capacity building for innovation in translation and commercialization. This public infrastructure will reduce costs for startups and SMMs to enter and compete in the A&D market.<br/><br/>The Talent Infrastructure supports the region?s innovation industry through upskilling of local workforce talent and K-12 outreach to build interest in careers in the A&D industry. Project lead organizations, The Aerospace Center and the W.M. Keck Center for 3D Innovation at The University of Texas at El Paso have developed new approaches to solving the STEM talent crisis facing the nation with a unique student-centered research model. Skill development strategies have produced graduates who are in high demand because of their abilities to immediately provide value to employers. This research model excels at opening new pathways into the A&D sector for groups traditionally underrepresented in the workforce. The Centers? students are 80% Latino, two-thirds come from families who make less than $37,000, and half are first-generation college students. The two centers are national leaders in training female engineers ? 29% of their students are women, which is much higher than peer institutions in the same fields.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine will expand this model with a technician training program called Aerospace and Defense Technologies and Manufacturing Training Centers (ADTech). A&D manufacturers often complain that new graduates of engineering and technician programs often lack the skills needed to be immediately productive and require expensive additional on-site training to be ready for the demands of their new job. The ADTech skills development platform, which expands on the success of programs at UTEP, will use proven skills-focused strategies to train a technician workforce that can meet the demands of A&D and advanced manufacturing employers. This agile training platform will integrate best practices in vocational training including supporting an open talent ecosystem, digital learning opportunities, and comprehensive partnership coordination that meets the needs of local SMMs.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine builds from significant investments and partnerships that have been developed over the two decades to fuel growth in this sector. This growth will lift the region?s median income to the national average and increase the region?s corporate footprint. The capital influx will spill over into other regional industries, creating broad and inclusive wealth building in this historically poor region where a majority of residents identify as Latino.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials will meet the growing needs of many current and emerging scanning and sensing applications that are limited by the strength of THz-frequency light sources. The introduction of brighter THz light sources into current and developing scanners will provide enhanced resolution and sensitivity in a broad range of imaging and sensing applications, including in airport scanners, medical imaging devices, and quality control scanners in manufacturing. These results will expand the impact of THz-frequency scanners, which are safe (non-ionizing radiation) and can provide unique information in many scanning, medical imaging, and sensing applications. The project will also train a diverse group of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in the field of materials development and entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The proposed project involves the scale up of newly discovered organic materials capable of generating high intensity terahertz-frequency light. Scanning and imaging instruments that employ terahertz-frequency light are safer than many common X-ray based scanners yet are often limited by the lack of bright terahertz-light sources. The organic new materials being produced for commercialization in this proposal provide nearly double the THz light output from current commercial sources. The scale up and growth of larger terahertz-generating crystals will meet the growing demands of companies and researchers who are developing new terahertz-based technologies and who require brighter terahertz sources. Organic materials generally have limited lifetimes due to decomposition under ambient conditions. On this project, commercialization of our prototype layered crystal structures will both enhance THz output and minimize crystal damage during terahertz light generation. These more robust sources of terahertz light will enable the use of organic terahertz light sources in scanners and imagers that previously could not employ this technology due to the short lifetime of organic crystals. In combination, the commercialization of these technologies will facilitate rapid growth in the terahertz scanner sector, enabling safer and more sensitive scanning and imaging technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The availability of fossil teeth this old has increased significantly in the last decades, yet many of these findings are of isolated teeth that remain unattributed to any species or genus.  To address this issue, the doctoral student uses a new approach that allows for improved taxonomic identification of ancient hominin teeth and furthers the understanding of dental and morphological boundaries between these hominin species.  Information derived from hominin fossil teeth that are not assigned to a species cannot be fully integrated into paleo-anthropological analyses and remain underutilized. In addition to training a graduate student the project includes the training of undergraduate students, along with plans to share results with the public through outreach activities, and the resulting 3D scans will be made available in public repositories. <br/><br/>This project collects metric, non-metric, and two-dimensional landmark data from the teeth of all known Pliocene hominin species dated to 4.2 to 3.0 million years ago. The goal is to assess the affinity of numerous taxonomically unattributed isolated teeth that come from sites dated to that period. The large sample size of teeth in each of the comparative species allows meaningful observations in terms of identifying discrete dental traits or set of traits for each taxon. Once identified, these can be used in the taxonomic identification of newly discovered isolated teeth. Results obtained are interpreted considering recent hypotheses regarding Pliocene hominin diversity and the mode of speciation in the Australopithecus anamensis-Australopithecus afarensis lineage. Furthermore, the occlusal images of tooth crowns, three-dimensional scans of fossil casts, and dental metric, non-metric, and landmark measurements generated by this project are significant for future research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also plays an important role in the destruction of ozone. Nitrous oxide is produced by microorganisms in low-oxygen marine environments, which are important sources of N2O to the atmosphere. The northern Benguela Upwelling System off the west coast of Africa is one of the major oceanic Oxygen Deficient Zones (ODZs). Despite the recognition that the northern Benguela Upwelling System is a significant source of N2O, it remains an understudied ecosystem, particularly the sedimentary environment. In this study, a team of geochemists and microbial ecologists will investigate N2O cycling in northern Benguela Upwelling System sediments. The goal of the work is to describe the role of sediments both in this particular system and more broadly, in order to improve scientists? ability to predict future emissions of this important greenhouse gas under changing environmental conditions. The project will support three undergraduates and three graduate students at the University of South Carolina (USC) and Florida State University. The project includes collaboration with scientists in South Africa and Namibia. The University of South Carolina will host students from each of these countries for six week internships as part of the project. The team is planning substantial outreach and educational activities in the U.S. and southern Africa.<br/><br/><br/>The contribution of different N2O producing and consuming processes in the northern Benguela Upwelling System will be determined with samples collected during two cruises of opportunity. Concentration, stable isotopic and isotopomer data, 15N-labeled rate measurements as well as molecular ecology data will be generated and synthesized to determine 1) the net sediment-water column flux of N2O, 2) N2O production and consumption rates for different processes, 3) controls by environmental conditions (e.g., oxygen (O2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and nutrient concentrations, O2 penetration depth, as well as organic matter elemental composition), and 4) the link between measured rates and the active processes that lead to N2O production by bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes, as well as bacterial and archaeal N2O consumption. This project will disentangle the relative contribution of these different processes by combining multi-isotope mass balance and meta-genomic/transcriptomic data. The study will generate a comprehensive dataset with new information on the contribution of archaea, bacteria (including large chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria), fungi and other microbial eukaryotes for N2O production in relation to environmental conditions. The sediment data will complement water-column N2O concentration, stable isotope, isotopomer, rate measurement, and microbial ecology data collected concurrently as part of two other NSF).

The project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by chemically and isotopically analyzing stored filter samples collected between 2005 and 2018 at various locations in southern New England. The 13-year record obtained through this study will help inform diverse fields including atmospheric chemistry, ecology, health, climate and policy.<br/> <br/>The project aims at using a unique combination of concentration and isotopic compositions to help constrain atmospheric mechanisms of nitrate and sulfate formation. Archived filters will provide a seasonal record that spans a period during which significant declines in emission of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide gases have led to associated, albeit non-linear decreases in particulate nitrate and sulfate. The cause for non-linearity is investigated by using fractionation of stable isotopes of (i) nitrogen and sulfur for fingerprinting and source apportionment of emission sources, and (ii) oxygen to inform production pathways for nitrate and sulfate. Novel data generated from this work will impact fields beyond atmospheric chemistry by inferring trends in ecological systems and global climate. The PI team will work with staff at various facilities and supervise one graduate and several undergraduate students to complete this labor-intensive analytical study.

This flexibility makes them essential for developing the next generation of battery technology, enabling additive manufacturing processes, and mimicking the performance of biological materials. In most gels, however, the solid-like and liquid-like properties are dependent on each other, drastically limiting their utility in industrial and scientific applications. To address this critical knowledge gap, this award aims to design gels with independent elasticity and viscosity by using polymer additives. These specific polymers possess endgroups that bind to dispersed colloids to generate stiff solid-like materials that readily break down during processing to create low viscosity fluids. This approach will result in efficient and cost-effective materials comprised primarily of solvent but with mechanical properties comparable to high performance engineering materials. The properties of these polymer-linked gels will be tuned and optimized by manipulating polymer chemistry and characterized using optical microscopy and novel rheological procedures. Additionally, this project will engage in targeted outreach efforts focused on recruiting and retaining LGBTQ+ youth in STEM fields to offset persistently low participation rates. Outreach efforts will include hands-on experiential workshops conducted in collaboration with local community organizations, role model introductions and mentorship, and the development of a STEM-focused support network for LGBTQ+ students at the University of Rhode Island.  <br/><br/>Colloidal gels are complex soft materials encountered throughout scientific and industrial applications ranging from slurries for battery production to synthetic scaffolds for tissue engineering and to inks for 3D printing. The performance of these materials depends critically on the interplay between structural and dynamical effects that underlie their emergent properties. Although many applications require competing design constraints such as robust mechanical stiffness but rapid mass transfer, the properties of most existing colloidal systems remain coupled, reducing synthetic flexibility and limiting their design. This experimental investigation of a novel class of rheological modifiers ? telechelic triblock copolymers ? aims to decouple the linear and nonlinear mechanical properties of colloidal gels. The chemistry of the triblock copolymers will be manipulated to generate extended conformations that promote bridge formation and drive colloidal self-assembly. Additionally, the resulting structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the polymer-linked gels will be characterized and these hierarchical properties related to nanoscale transport. Finally, the linear and nonlinear rheology of polymer-linked colloidal suspensions will be characterized using novel rheological protocols to identify high-performance yield stress fluids. These fundamental research aims will be integrated into a comprehensive educational and outreach plan that engages LGBTQ+ youth in Rhode Island.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also plays an important role in the destruction of ozone. Nitrous oxide is produced by microorganisms in low-oxygen marine environments, which are important sources of N2O to the atmosphere. The northern Benguela Upwelling System off the west coast of Africa is one of the major oceanic Oxygen Deficient Zones (ODZs). Despite the recognition that the northern Benguela Upwelling System is a significant source of N2O, it remains an understudied ecosystem, particularly the sedimentary environment. In this study, a team of geochemists and microbial ecologists will investigate N2O cycling in northern Benguela Upwelling System sediments. The goal of the work is to describe the role of sediments both in this particular system and more broadly, in order to improve scientists? ability to predict future emissions of this important greenhouse gas under changing environmental conditions. The project will support three undergraduates and three graduate students at the University of South Carolina (USC) and Florida State University. The project includes collaboration with scientists in South Africa and Namibia. The University of South Carolina will host students from each of these countries for six week internships as part of the project. The team is planning substantial outreach and educational activities in the U.S. and southern Africa.<br/><br/><br/>The contribution of different N2O producing and consuming processes in the northern Benguela Upwelling System will be determined with samples collected during two cruises of opportunity. Concentration, stable isotopic and isotopomer data, 15N-labeled rate measurements as well as molecular ecology data will be generated and synthesized to determine 1) the net sediment-water column flux of N2O, 2) N2O production and consumption rates for different processes, 3) controls by environmental conditions (e.g., oxygen (O2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and nutrient concentrations, O2 penetration depth, as well as organic matter elemental composition), and 4) the link between measured rates and the active processes that lead to N2O production by bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes, as well as bacterial and archaeal N2O consumption. This project will disentangle the relative contribution of these different processes by combining multi-isotope mass balance and meta-genomic/transcriptomic data. The study will generate a comprehensive dataset with new information on the contribution of archaea, bacteria (including large chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria), fungi and other microbial eukaryotes for N2O production in relation to environmental conditions. The sediment data will complement water-column N2O concentration, stable isotope, isotopomer, rate measurement, and microbial ecology data collected concurrently as part of two other NSF). Sediment and water-column N2O data will be incorporated in a 3-dimensional nitrogen based physical/biogeochemical model.

The potential for drought and forest degradation to break this forest-sustaining recycling system, pushing the Amazon rainforest past a point of collapse into a degraded or even savanna state, has received much recent attention in the media and scientific literature. However, exactly how the so-called ?tipping point? occurs in any given forest site is unclear. This project investigates two possible causes of tipping points, both of which are predicted to become more common in the future: severe drought linked to El Nio climate conditions, and forest degradation caused by increasingly frequent strong storms and winds. This award capitalizes on a fleeting opportunity to observe how the ongoing drought, amplified by previous forest degradation, shuts down the capacity of trees to transfer water from the soil to the atmosphere, and thereby breaks the water pump that sustains rainfall recycling throughout the Amazon. The knowledge produced will help scientists predict when and how Amazon-wide tipping points might occur, which would importantly affect weather patterns, water resources, and economic stability in South America, as well as global climate. This study has broad impacts on education, through training of graduate students at public universities and through a custom-designed high school educational program that connects U.S. students with Amazon researchers and real scientific data from trees of the world?s most famous tropical forest.<br/><br/>This study focuses on whole-forest and leaf-level observations of transpiration?the transport of water by trees from soil to atmosphere during photosynthesis?through drought and initial recovery. It tests three key hypotheses at the heart of the Amazon forest tipping-point paradigm. H1) Whole-forest drought sensitivity is heightened by the legacy of previous droughts. H1 is tested by comparing eddy-flux-tower measured 2023/24 drought response to those of previous droughts, notably the extreme El Nio of 2015/16. H2) Whole-forest drought sensitivity emerges from individual trees? differing ecophysiological strategies for drought response. These strategies contribute to ecosystem-scale drought sensitivity and structure the tipping point onset. H2 is tested by observing responses across six dominant species, providing a foundation for individual-to-ecosystem trait-based scaling. H3) Forest drought sensitivity is heightened by disturbance-induced forest degradation. H3, widely postulated but never directly tested, explores the tipping point mechanisms relating increased drought sensitivity to altered energy balance from forest cover loss. H3 is tested by comparing tree ecohydrology and microenvironments between forest interior and large windthrow gaps. This research will provide new, hard-to-observe datasets that will allow critical tests (and subsequent improvement) of models of forest drought response and ecohydrologic tipping points<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project focuses on understanding how movement and activity are influenced by nocturnal and seasonal changes in environment in a non-human primate, informing broader questions about primate evolution and adaptation. This project provides capacity building, training, and mentorship for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as informing conservation efforts for nocturnal mammals.<br/><br/>This project uses an integration of data from direct observations, radio-tracking collars, and temperature and humidity loggers to record environmental and movement information for a small, nocturnal, non-human primate.

This research evaluates the relationship between movement and environment, how sampling effort impacts the results, and builds upon previous home range and habitat suitability models by incorporating a 3D component to represent the vertical movement employed by arboreal primates.

A series of studies will be performed using textured surfaces and porous substrates with different micro-textures and different softness to uncover key factors governing the interactions between liquids and soft textured surfaces. A host of educational activities are integrated with the proposed project to provide interdisciplinary learning experiences to pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students.

The accuracy of the model outputs has progressively increased with time as a result of several important factors, such as the availability of more powerful computers, and the continuous ingestion of experimental data during runtime. Nonetheless, there remain significant weaknesses in the representation of some of the characteristic physical processes. One of these is the representation of land-atmosphere interactions, which capture the way the air exchanges heat, moisture, and drag with the Earth?s surface. Traditionally, these processes have been represented using a formulation that was originally developed for canonical flow and surface conditions, and which is known to not perform well under realistic surface configurations (e.g. mountainous terrain, over forests, heterogeneous surfaces, etc.). Nonetheless it remains the workhorse in all numerical weather prediction and climate models given the lack of better alternatives. In this research project a new approach will be developed that facilitate the extension of the existing land-atmosphere interaction formulation to be applicable to all realistic flow and surface configurations. Results from this work will represent a paradigm change in the way near surface processes are represented in numerical weather prediction and climate models, leading to the next leap forward in weather and climate prediction accuracy. This research has the potential to impact everyone, from the local farmer in rural U.S.A, to investors planning for the next offshore wind farm, as well as the regular family that is just checking the weather forecast to plan for the upcoming weekend.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will leverage the generalized Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) that includes the metric of turbulence anisotropy as an additional non-dimensional term. As the first step, a Lagrangian averaging scheme will be implemented in a turbulence resolving Earth System Model such that it is possible to compute turbulence anisotropy on the fly, with the goal of instantaneously correcting MOST scaling relations. As the second step, the robustness of this new framework will be tested by running different Large-Eddy Simulations of different realistic complex flow configurations and comparing the results with existing experimental datasets. In addition, this new framework will also be tested with respect to its dependence with spatial resolution. The goal here is to understand how spatial resolution affects the computation of turbulence anisotropy and its corresponding effect in correcting the momentum, mass, and energy exchanges near the surface. This project represents a very much needed first step, before the anisotropy-based generalized Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) can be implemented in non-resolving turbulence Earth System Models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the research on market integration and health has emphasized the shift away from infectious diseases to chronic, non-communicable ones. However, rapid changes in land use that co-occur with shifts to commercial agriculture position rural/low-resource communities at the frontlines of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It is thus vital to build knowledge of how economic markets connect rural communities with more central towns, potentially facilitating the spread of a local outbreak to a regional (or even global) scale. This doctoral dissertation research contributes to fundamental knowledge on the interactions between market integration, human movement patterns, and infectious disease transmission in local and regional contexts. This research can be shared with key stakeholders and public health decision makers and help build local research capacity through the training of students in network analysis methods. <br/><br/>Human movement patterns are complex among the rural/low-resource settings where novel infectious diseases are most likely to emerge. This project uses leading-edge computational and serological methods to develop a richer understanding of how social change transforms disease ecology. The investigators use detailed survey data on individual-level travel behavior to construct a regional network of villages and towns connected by mobility patterns. This network provides a foundation for conducting computer simulations to understand how changes in market-related activities affect the regional spread of infectious diseases. The investigators also use serological assays to quantify individual-level exposure to a diverse range of viruses, which provides insight into how market integration influences the types of viruses people are exposed to and how they spread among communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shape and muscular attachments to this bone are important for tongue movements, chewing, swallowing, and vocalization. This doctoral dissertation research investigates the relationship between shape, position, and muscular attachment of the hyoid to determine the role of this bone in feeding across primates. This work informs researchers about the function of the hyoid, which may result in the formation of novel treatments for  speech and swallowing disorders in humans. This work also builds STEM talent by supporting undergraduate and graduate training and creating an openly available dataset of microCT scans that can be used in scientific outreach projects aimed at K-12 students and the public. Overall, this work is poised to educate the public on scientific and evolutionary concepts, build and encourage future researchers, and add to the current understanding of head and neck anatomy and function, which has important biomedical implications.  <br/><br/>The hyoid and the muscles that connect it to the skull (i.e., the suprahyoid muscles), are central to chewing, swallowing, tongue manipulation, and vocalization. How these behaviors, specifically those involved in feeding, affect hyoid anatomy is not well known as previous work has focused on vocalization as a driving factor for hyoid shape. The hyoid is in near-constant motion during feeding and is pulled toward the oral cavity during swallowing by the suprahyoid muscles. The goal of this research is to quantify the impact of swallowing by evaluating variation in hyoid shape and position and their relationship to the suprahyoid muscles and skull in primates. This project utilizes microCT scans and iodine staining methods to visualize the hyoid apparatus along with 3D shape analyses to investigate the relationships between the hyoid, skull, and musculature. Additionally, this work analyzes how these relationships change throughout growth and development in two closely related species of primates with notable differences in diet. In doing so, this work can provide valuable insights into the evolution of human hyoid shape and function and put human hyoid anatomy into the broader context of primate hyoid variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, humans are not the only primates to experience obstetric difficulties. Birth complications as severe as maternal or infant death have been recorded in some small-bodied monkey species, whose babies have relatively large bodies during birth. This doctoral dissertation research tests the hypothesis that infant cranial narrowness is an evolutionary adaptation to mitigate obstetric constraint in these small-bodied monkeys. By deepening our understanding of obstetric constraint in nonhuman primates, and how these species cope with it, we may also better understand the evolutionary roots of the human obstetric dilemma. This project supports the research and training of an early-career female scientist and development of educational modules on the evolution of obstetric constraint and the necessity of obstetric and reproductive healthcare. <br/><br/>Many small-bodied new-world monkeys exhibit a long and narrow skull shape, in contrast to the globular shape observed in humans and apes. Previous research suggests that cranial narrowness allows these species to give birth to large-brained infants while minimizing the risk of obstructed labor, drawing parallels to the human obstetric dilemma. Conversely, small-bodied old-world monkeys do not exhibit cranial narrowness as adults, a disparity that could be explained by variation in obstetric constraints or by interspecies differences in how cranial shape changes after birth. This project analyzes the correlation between obstetric constraint and cranial narrowness in nonhuman primates and uses geometric morphometrics to track cranial shape change from infant to adult life stages in representative species of small-bodied new-world and old-world monkeys. The investigators synthesize methods from prior research in the fields of obstetrics and developmental morphology to create 3D reconstructions of the primate birth canal and generate infant primate CT scan data valuable to future anthropological research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign makes observations of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the layer of the atmosphere from roughly 14km to 18km between the tropical troposphere and stratosphere, using balloons designed to float at a constant altitude for flights of up to 3 months.  The balloons are launched from the Seychelles and float around the equator at the top of the TTL (near 18km) or in the lower stratosphere at an altitude close to 20km.  Strateole-2 was planned as a set of three deployments, a preliminary engineering deployment with 8 balloon flights followed by two science deployments with 20 flights each. The first two deployments took place in 2019 and 2021 and funds for the PIs' participation in these deployments were provided through AGS-1643022.  Funds provided here support participation in the third campaign, scheduled to begin in October 2025.<br/><br/>The primary task under this award is the production of balloon-borne instruments to observe temperature, moisture, aerosols, and cirrus cloud ice particles.  One instrument is the LASP Particle Counter (LPC), named for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.  The LPC flies on the balloon gondola and detects aerosols and ice particles using laser backscatter. It can determine the concentration of particles of sizes ranging from 0.3 to 30 microns in 32 size bins.  The LPC is accompanied by a moisture and temperature sensor developed for use in weather balloons, the Vaisala RS41, which can detect moisture at the low humidities found in the TTL and lower stratosphere.  Five LPCs will be flown in the 2025 deployment, three at 18km and two at 20km.<br/><br/>A second instrument is the Reeldown Aerosol, Cloud, Humidity and Temperature Sensor (RACHuTS), a 2kg package which is reeled up and down on a cord to generate soundings extending 2km below the balloon.  RACHuTS integrates the Thermodynamic SENsor (TSEN, developed by a French team) with a smaller version of the LPC called the ROPC (RACHuTS Optical Particle Counter, with 8 size bins from 0.3 to 10 microns), along with an RS41 and the Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) moisture sensor developed under AGS-2233136.  TDL is an improvement over the FLASH-B moisture sensor used in the previous deployments since it is not sensitive to ambient light and can thus be used during the day, doubling the opportunities for profiling.  RACHuTS makes profiles with one meter vertical resolution, with one profile as it descends and another as it returns to the gondola.  Three RACHuTS profilers will be flown in the 2025 deployment, all at 18km.<br/><br/>As in the earlier deployments the measurements taken using LPC and RACHuTS will be used to address three issues in TTL science.  The first is the extent to which supersaturation is an important factor in determining humidity in the stratosphere.  Stratospheric humidity is thought to be limited by the saturation vapor pressure at the coldest temperature air encounters as it rises through the TTL to enter the stratosphere, under the assumption that water vapor condensation or deposition occurs when relative humidity reaches 100%.  But data from previous deployments shows relative humidities above 150%, suggesting that the cold point saturation vapor pressure may not be as strict a limit as previously supposed.  A related issue is the role of atmospheric waves in the formation of cirrus clouds in the TTL, as previous RACHuTS deployments and other evidence suggests that the majority of ice particle layers within the TTL are generated by cooling associated with rising motions in waves.  The layers can be quite thin, perhaps only 10 meters, thus the one meter resolution of RACHuTS profiles is necessary to observe the layers.  The third issue to be addressed in the project is the finding of layers of large particles, in the size range from 2 to 20 microns, at relative humidities too low to allow ice formation. The nature of these particles has yet to be determined.  One strategy for studying them is to fly the LPC on two balloons at the 20km level, which is above the TTL and typically too warm and dry to support ice clouds.  The detection of super-micron particles at that level would be a strong argument that the particles are not composed of ordinary ice.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the unique dataset to be collected, in particular the long sampling time, high vertical resolution, and high quality of the observations. RACHuTS and LPC observations will be made freely available to the research community so that they can be used in ways not anticipated here. In addition, the project develops novel technologies for meteorological observations that could have a wide array of scientific applications. Beyond these considerations, the project supports a postdoctoral research associate, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area.  The project develops a substantial international collaboration and also provides support and training to a research scientist and an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to perform these tasks requires that the bones of the hand and foot have an appropriate size and shape. Human hand and foot bones have some key differences in structure from our closest living primate relative and these differences are encoded in the genome by DNA sequences which differ between the two species. In this doctoral dissertation project, thousands of human and non-human primate DNA sequences are screened to identify underlying genomic regions that are likely to encode the differences observed. The project advances knowledge about the developmental genetics of the hand and foot in the context of human evolution and supports undergraduate and graduate training, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>Numerous studies have identified thousands of genomic regions with an excess of human-specific DNA changes. Many of these regions were likely under positive selection over the course of human evolution, but tying specific genetic changes to phenotypic change remains a challenge akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To identify genetic changes underlying uniquely human features of the hand and foot skeleton, this proposal uses the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) system to simultaneously screen the human and chimp versions of thousands of genomic regions known to be involved in the developing human hand or foot for differential activity between the two species in cartilage cells. This research can shed light on the genetic architecture patterning individual elements of the hand and foot skeleton, which can inform our understanding of human evolution, development, and disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These incubator projects have identified research infrastructure gaps related to assessments, teacher practices, and digital tools to support student learning and have proposed pilot tools, cyberinfrastructure, large-scale datasets, etc., for filling these gaps. To scale these pilots, the teams will need to successfully develop proposals to create mid-scale research infrastructure (Midscale RI).

The use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) has improved the lighting efficiency, but still more than 50% of the electrical energy is dissipated as heat (emitted phonons). Improving energy conversion and demonstrating timely and significant impact of phonon engineering using gallium-nitride GaN LED is the goal of this proposed EAGER. This will be done by adding a heterobarrier (HB) layer to the LED structure for a net absorption and recycling of phonon emissions that will provide improved power efficiency. The objectives are to theoretically predict the improvements and to fabricate and test the optimal design, aiming to demonstrate the proof-of-concept and make it available for technological implementations. Through collaboration with an GaN LED and display expert, the proposed improvement verifications can be implemented at commercial level resulting in significant national energy savings and enhanced device thermal management. Fundamental understanding and insightful use of the phonon-electron-photon interactions advance the heat transfer physics and engineering.  <br/><br/>The proposed research would be the first attempt at in-situ spectral-phonon recycling in LED using a graded HB. The research combines simulations of the phonon transport and recycling behavior to understand and advance the novel idea of phonon recycling, and also includes an experimental verification of the new concept. The one-year EAGER effort is therefore focused on demonstrating the new concept of phonon-recycling for LEDs, and if successful can provide significant paybacks in terms of energy savings. The proposed research advances the premise that the benefits of phonon-recycling via the HB is achieved through three distinct pathways: (a) reduced heat load resulting in a temperature decrease for LEDs (b) increased power efficiency, where the electric current in the LED harvests phonon energy, creating a net potential gain, and (c) enhanced photon emission spectra due to the net potential gain in the HB layer. The predictions in the proposed research use mesoscale (Boltzmann transport) interactions, which involves phonons, electrons and holes, and photons. The fabrication and testing/characterization of the optimal HB GaN LED will provide the first ever experimental demonstration of improvements in LED performance and energy savings via the use of a HB. The proposed research aligns with the Department of Energy solid-state lighting R&D goals for 2035 which would enable national energy savings equivalent to 3% of US energy consumption in 2022.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential for drought and forest degradation to break this forest-sustaining recycling system, pushing the Amazon rainforest past a point of collapse into a degraded or even savanna state, has received much recent attention in the media and scientific literature. However, exactly how the so-called ?tipping point? occurs in any given forest site is unclear. This project investigates two possible causes of tipping points, both of which are predicted to become more common in the future: severe drought linked to El Nio climate conditions, and forest degradation caused by increasingly frequent strong storms and winds. This award capitalizes on a fleeting opportunity to observe how the ongoing drought, amplified by previous forest degradation, shuts down the capacity of trees to transfer water from the soil to the atmosphere, and thereby breaks the water pump that sustains rainfall recycling throughout the Amazon. The knowledge produced will help scientists predict when and how Amazon-wide tipping points might occur, which would importantly affect weather patterns, water resources, and economic stability in South America, as well as global climate. This study has broad impacts on education, through training of graduate students at public universities and through a custom-designed high school educational program that connects U.S. students with Amazon researchers and real scientific data from trees of the world?s most famous tropical forest.<br/><br/>This study focuses on whole-forest and leaf-level observations of transpiration?the transport of water by trees from soil to atmosphere during photosynthesis?through drought and initial recovery. It tests three key hypotheses at the heart of the Amazon forest tipping-point paradigm. H1) Whole-forest drought sensitivity is heightened by the legacy of previous droughts. H1 is tested by comparing eddy-flux-tower measured 2023/24 drought response to those of previous droughts, notably the extreme El Nio of 2015/16. H2) Whole-forest drought sensitivity emerges from individual trees? differing ecophysiological strategies for drought response. These strategies contribute to ecosystem-scale drought sensitivity and structure the tipping point onset. H2 is tested by observing responses across six dominant species, providing a foundation for individual-to-ecosystem trait-based scaling. H3) Forest drought sensitivity is heightened by disturbance-induced forest degradation. H3, widely postulated but never directly tested, explores the tipping point mechanisms relating increased drought sensitivity to altered energy balance from forest cover loss. H3 is tested by comparing tree ecohydrology and microenvironments between forest interior and large windthrow gaps. This research will provide new, hard-to-observe datasets that will allow critical tests (and subsequent improvement) of models of forest drought response and ecohydrologic tipping points<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, some zoo-housed gorillas show comparable rates of cardiovascular and metabolic disease to humans. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the diet, nutrition, activity profiles, and energy expenditure of male gorillas, across age groups and health statuses. Understanding the repercussions associated with the altered diet and activity patterns that they experience in zoological settings can inform our knowledge of human health issues associated with sedentary lifestyles and diets consisting of processed, modified, and cultivated foods. The project also informs primate husbandry practices to more accurately emulate gorilla food sources found in natural habitats and improve primate health and welfare. This research facilitates the professional and scientific training of a doctoral student pursuing a career in STEM and supports advanced skill development opportunities for multiple undergraduate students interested in animal behavior and conservation.  <br/><br/>This study assesses how diet and environment affect the nutrition, activity patterns and cardiovascular health of male gorillas that live in zoological institutions. Data obtained in this study can inform anthropological theory as well as animal welfare practices and management strategies for this critically endangered ape species. The study employs a combination of behavioral observations to establish daily activity patterns and feeding behavior among gorilla males. Additionally, food items consumed by these gorillas are analyzed to determine their nutritional value. Total energy expenditure is measured using doubly labeled water and urine collection.  These data are used to design models that identify discrepancies between target nutrition and actual nutrient ingestion.

The project aims to improve postsecondary students' academic success and retention within STEM disciplines using the Success through Self-Regulated Learning (StSRL) framework. In self-regulated learning, students manage their behavior before, during, and after a learning task to allow them to master the task or concept at hand.  Theoretically and empirically grounded, the StSRL framework will target five related components of self-regulated learning: strategy use, metacognition, motivation, management, and content practice. The framework will provide a platform for instructors to generate dynamic, bidirectional prompts that students respond to through an app or a course learning management system (LMS), thereby embedding effective self-regulated learning practices within scientific course contexts. Prompts will vary by format (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended response, slider), as well as by intended learning function (i.e., metacognition, strategy, motivation, content, management). Preliminary data suggest the StSRL framework holds promise to increase students? learning and retention in STEM pipelines. This project plans to first focus on students enrolled in biology courses and then will scale to additional STEM contexts. Data collected from this project will allow the project team to study how to maximize the intervention and will inform faculty professional development to support students? self-regulated learning. <br/><br/>The project team plans to test the efficacy of the Success through Self-Regulated Learning (StSRL) framework and systematic interventions designed to increase successful learning outcomes, student achievement, and retention in post-secondary STEM coursework. This project intends to address four overarching objectives: 1) Further test the impact of instructor and student use of the StSRL framework on SRL, self-efficacy, and achievement outcomes, 2) Examine how differences in instructors? use of the framework inform intervention success, 3) Test StSRL generalizability and scale up across STEM domains and learning contexts, and 4) Iteratively design and provide faculty professional development for SRL STEM interventions. Quantitative methods will be employed to study whether such objectives have been met. This project plans to measure the impact of the framework and interventions on student achievement and retention in STEM through rich data sources. Project data will include students? demographics, course performance, and StSRL prompt performance, as well as SRL outcomes, such as metacognition, motivational variables, and learning strategy use. In addition, data analytics from the bidirectional, real-time interventions will contribute to understanding the implementation of large-scale, technology-supported interventions. Rigorous study of instructors? use of the framework will inform and improve faculty professional development to serve as a model for scaling interventions. An interdisciplinary team of learning researchers and science faculty will offer a combination of education theory expertise with discipline-based education research knowledge to contribute broadly to scholarly communities. This project hopes to not only directly impact students? self-regulated learning, learning outcomes, and retention, but also provide a roadmap for deep collaborations among learning experts and science-content experts to drive advancement of evidence-based pedagogies in STEM contexts. Results from previous work in biology and physics settings will be scaled to include other disciplines and, importantly, other populations, including learners enrolled in regional colleges, adult STEM learners in online settings, and underrepresented minority students participating in summer bridge programs.

New biomolecular methods complement archaeological approaches to address timely biocultural questions regarding the status, health, and wellbeing of tropical agriculturalists living in urban societies in the past. Understanding the biological consequences of the strategies that communities and individuals employ to meet their nutritional needs while constrained by institutional inequality is a highly relevant topic today. Most of the world?s population is directly or indirectly impacted by social inequalities that influence the types, quality, and quantity of foods consumed. Archaeology is well suited to provide insight into these complex relationships in the past by linking environmental and social variables to individual decision making and the consequent health related outcomes. This study focuses on three questions: (1) within a system of structural inequality what strategies did people use to procure food; (2) how do these strategies relate to the social and environmental constraints they faced; and (3) What were the health-related outcomes of individuals of differing statuses?<br/><br/>This study explores how variation in social and environmental conditions can be observed in the biological remains of individuals and how they construct niches in response to socially driven selective pressures. Multiple types of stable isotope analyses grounded in human and plant physiology are applied to archaeological skeletal remains and to a sample of modern neotropical plants to assess physiological status and link plant categories to individual and community level diets. The samples were recovered from three political centers occupied about fifteen hundred years ago. The doctoral student is trained in novel applications of carbon and nitrogen compound specific isotope analysis of amino acids. These are applied to both humans and plants and coupled with studies of bulk carbon from bone bioapatite to reconstruct human diet in more detail than bulk tissue isotope analysis alone. This methodology is applied to a population of tropical farmers allowing the researchers to explore the complex relationships between social and environmental pressures, the strategies that communities use to mitigate those pressures, and the potential biological impacts on those living within systems of institutional inequality. Additionally, this research provides a roadmap for future archaeological studies focusing on individual diet and health during the last decade or so of life that is also applicable to fragmented and incomplete skeletal collections that can confound osteological based methods and allows researchers to ask more nuanced questions about physiology in archaeological populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is how genetically similar individuals may develop different traits when exposed to different environments during their developmental period. In primates, and other social animals, the social environment is believed to be an especially important developmental influence. Male primates are particularly interesting subjects for developmental plasticity research due to their long developmental periods, the high variance in how many offspring they produce, and the variety of tactics they use to compete for mating opportunities. In many primate species, however, even basic male developmental patterns are not well understood. In this research project, the investigators explore if and how social environments affect the behavioral, hormonal, and physical development in males of an ape species. The diversity of social environments along with the extreme physical characteristics of these male apes makes them an excellent species in which to conduct this research. In addition to contributing to our understanding of the role that social environments play in determining adult characteristics in a close human relative, this project will make significant contributions to capacity building, education, and training.  <br/><br/>Limited information is currently available regarding how male primate developmental patterns are shaped by developmental conditions. This research project explores how social environments influence the behavioral, physiological, and morphological trajectories of male gorillas.

This project collects non-invasive behavioral and photogrammetry data, along with testosterone and DHEA-S metabolites obtained from urine and fecal samples, on ~120 habituated male gorillas living in social groups of varying demographic compositions. Newly obtained information is combined with available longitudinal data to generate hormonal, physical, and behavioral profiles from infancy through adulthood. These data are used to better understand the order in which developmental changes occur, the nature and degree of inter-individual developmental variation, and the role(s) that social environments may play in predicting such variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The endosperm of the maize kernel is a primary reservoir of nutrients. It is composed of several functionally unique cell layers that support kernel development. This project investigates molecular and physiological processes of development in one such layer, the basal endosperm transfer cells (BETCs). In particular, experiments will characterize the role of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, as well as their byproducts, as important determinants of chromatin structure and gene expression. Packaging into euchromatin (open chromatin) often leads to increased gene expression, whereas packaging into heterochromatin (closed chromatin) is generally a marker of gene silencing, and the direct role for metabolites in regulating this packaging is a novel finding. The project will also organize Corn Summer Internships in Gene Silencing (CornSInGS) for hands-on laboratory and field exercises for local high school students to learn the inheritance of crop traits. Plant phenotypes will be used to demonstrate gene silencing switches. This project will also collaborate with faculty and undergraduates from Virginia State University for undergraduate summer internships overlapping with the CornSInGS workshop. Findings will provide knowledge of the biological processes in the nucleus that are required for the development of endosperm and a healthy maize kernel. <br/><br/>Basal endosperm transfer cells lie at the interface of phloem termini connecting the source of photosynthates (leaves) with the storage cells (sink) of starchy endosperm. At the heart of early kernel developmental events are cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and RNA splicing. Mis-regulation of any of these basic processes causes defects in cell differentiation, growth, and development. Maize ufo1 (Zmufo1; unstable factor for orange1) mutants have BETC defects that were found to be associated with aberrant expression of TCA cycle genes, metabolites, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and basic regulatory processes. Zmufo1 mutants therefore provide a varied set of kernel defects and plant phenotypes to help characterize cellular differentiation. This proposal will characterize metabolic and epigenetic regulatory events that are required to maintain cellular homeostasis during early basal endosperm development. Specific aims are: 1. Characterize redox-dependent, spatiotemporal chromatin remodeling during BETC differentiation as modulated by Zmufo1. 2. Characterize ZmUFO1-associated, protein-protein interactions. 3. Confirm functionality of the  predicted ASF1-histone chaperone domain of ZmUFO1. The knowledge gained from this project can be applied to understand the development of other specialized cells supporting the embryo and endosperm of other cereal grains of economic importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental phenomenon in complexity theory is that intractable problems can have efficiently verifiable solutions, especially when the verification process (or ""proof"") is allowed to be interactive. Interactive proof protocols already play a central role in the theory of classical computing today, and have applications ranging from algorithms and optimization to cryptography. This project seeks to explore the power of interactive proofs in the presence of quantum computers, building on a line of recent work showing that quantum interactive proof protocols can exploit entanglement to be much more efficient than their classical counterparts. Areas of investigation of the project include methods to test untrusted quantum computers, studying the complexity of optimization problems arising in quantum physics and chemistry; as well as connections to the mathematics of quantum entanglement and operator algebras. The project will also support the training of graduate students and integration of ideas from the research into new courses at the undergraduate and graduate level aimed at computer scientists, physicists, and engineers.<br/><br/>Technically, the starting point of the project is the recent complexity-theoretical result that the class MIP* of multiprover interactive proofs is equal to the class RE of recursively enumerable languages (a class including undecidable problems such as the halting problem). The investigator will undertake three major directions of work. The first will simplify and generalize the techniques of the MIP* = RE result into a general suite of tools for constructing and analyzing quantum protocols in the multiprover setting. It is hoped that this research will lead to new quantum generalizations of important ideas from classical interactive proofs, such as direct product testing and the combinatorial proof of the PCP theorem. There are also connections to questions in operator algebras and group theory, such as the existence of non-hyperlinear groups. The second major direction is to use techniques from quantum cryptography to design new protocols to enable a classical client to delegate quantum computations in the single-device setting. Previous approaches to this problem are highly tailored to a specific, strong cryptographic assumption. The investigator?s goal is to build tools that enable multiprover protocols to be converted in a black-box way to single-device protocols, under more generic cryptographic assumptions. The third major direction is to investigate Hamiltonian complexity: the complexity of computing properties of low-energy states of a many-body quantum system. Mathematically, both Hamiltonian complexity and MIP* proof systems can be viewed as different generalizations of combinatorial optimization problems, such as MAX-CUT, to noncommuting matrix-valued variables. A major goal here is to make progress towards the quantum PCP conjecture, the major open problem in this area, drawing on ideas from MIP*=RE or elsewhere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet our understanding of how this single cell divides and differentiates into all of the specialized cells that make up different tissues within an organism is quite limited. The goal of this proposal is to understand how signaling cues arising from the spatial location of a cell within a tissue and its epigenetic state regulate gene expression during early human development. The function of a cell is tightly controlled by the cells location within a tissue and its intrinsic epigenetic landscape. While single-cell sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of mammalian systems by measuring the transcriptome and epigenome landscape within single cells, spatial information is lost using current methods. To better understand how spatial organization regulates gene expression in individual cells, the PI proposes to use photo-sensitive oligonucleotides to optically stamp the spatial positions of cells during development. This spatial information will be combined with single-cell mRNA sequencing and single-cell epigenetic features. Collectively, these techniques will map how spatial and epigenetic determinants control the specification of human primordial germ cells during early development. The data generated by the research aims will be used for a multi-layered and integrated educational program that includes a computational genomics bootcamp for high school students, a summer wet lab internship for undergraduates, and a mobile app game that introduces gene regulation concepts and targets high school students.<br/><br/>To comprehensively study how spatial organization regulates gene expression of individual cells, the PI will design cholesterol-tagged photo-sensitive oligonucleotides (PSO) that incorporate into cell membranes, enabling an optical ?stamp? of the position of each cell prior to tissue dissociation and single-cell mRNA sequencing. Quantifying both mRNA and the relative degradation of the PSOs in individual cells will enable mapping spatial single-cell transcriptomes at high-resolution. Further, the PI will develop spatially-resolved single-cell multiomics technologies to simultaneously sequence the transcriptome together with different epigenetic features from the same cell to directly relate how DNA methylation, DNA accessibility and histone marks tune gene expression in varied spatial contexts. Furthermore, by employing iterative rounds of optical labeling, they will capture cell migration with end-point single-cell multiomics sequencing to gain insights into how tissue morphogenesis impacts cellular phenotypes. These transformative methods will be used to specifically study how morphogen gradients, cell-cell interactions, and epigenetic reprogramming play a role in the specification of primordial germ cells (PGC), the precursors to egg or sperm, during human gastrulation. While the emergence of PGCs has been studied in detail in mice, lack of access to human embryos makes similar studies impossible. Therefore, 2D/3D in vitro gastruloid models of human development will be used to address the following: What is the identity of the progenitors that give rise to PGCs, what combination of morphogen gradients and epigenetic remodeling drive PGC specification, and the role of defined niches in giving rise to PGCs. Overall, the development of these spatially-resolved single-cell methods will provide key opportunities in the future to modulate cell identity for varied applications.

The goal of this project is to determine how changes in DNA structure impact expression of synthetic gene circuits and gene expression in general. The results of this project will have a broad impact on the design of gene circuits for applications such as gene and cell therapies.  Integrated into this research, there is a plan for educational initiatives that will engage, inspire, and train the next generation of mammalian synthetic biologists. <br/><br/>While significant efforts have been devoted to the logical design of synthetic circuitry, far less is understood regarding the impact of the emergent three-dimensional structure of genetic elements on circuit behavior. Synthetic gene circuits may serve as model microgenomic systems to explore the biophysical basis of gene regulation. As simplified models of gene networks, synthetic circuits provide a tool for examining the causal relationship between structure, function, and biophysical feedback in transcriptional networks. Synthetic biology aims to integrate synthetic genetic control systems within native control networks to direct cell behaviors. However, limited ability to prescribe transgene expression and to actuate changes in native gene expression constrains genetic programming of mammalian cells. In particular, the stochastic nature of transcription makes coordinating expression across multiple genetic elements challenging. Transcription induces a wave of DNA supercoiling, altering the binding affinity of RNA polymerases and reshaping the biochemical landscape of gene regulation. As supercoiling rapidly diffuses, transcription dynamically reshapes the regulation of proximal genes, forming a complex feedback loop. By harnessing biophysical regulation, the researchers have identified a mechanism for biasing the stochastic nature of transcription and changing the population behavior. This CAREER will use synthetic gene circuits to examine the generality of DNA supercoiling-mediated feedback to couple and tune transcription. By varying promoter identity, gene length, inter-gene spacing and syntax, this project will explore how each of these features impact expression profiles. Profiles of expression will be measured by RNA and protein levels in single cells using a combination of microscopy and flow cytometry-based techniques. To connect gene activity and syntax directly to structure, this project will map DNA structure at high resolution using a combination of genomic tools that will build a causal connection between syntax, transcriptional activity, and local genome structure. Understanding the design principles of supercoiling-mediated feedback will allow the researchers to define an essential and overlooked mechanism by which cells orchestrate complex tasks. With this understanding, the research will reshape our perspective on gene regulation and provide novel tools for illuminating mechanically fragile points within the genome that may be exploited by disease. This work will revolutionize our understanding of genome regulation while establishing an entirely new and orthogonal mode of gene expression control that can be harnessed to engineer novel functions, tailor existing circuits, and enable robust cell engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, compared to lithium reactions, sodium chemistry poses a considerable mechanical deformation to the electrodes and creates more stress and degradation that compromise battery performance. This project, supported by the Ceramics Program within the Division of Materials Research, seeks to create a fundamental understanding of battery degradation via a close integration of novel experiments, data analysis, and modeling approaches. Such knowledge is crucial to elucidating the aging mechanisms of sodium-based batteries, which synergistically contribute to the development of materials of enhanced reliability for the same applications. The multifaceted collaboration between Purdue and Virginia Tech provides unique training opportunities for developing workforce for STEM related careers, with particular relevance to meeting the demand of the energy industries, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades. The research also provides a platform to continue the recruitment and engagement of future scientists on convergent research skills and entrepreneurial training.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project aims to achieve a holistic understanding of chemomechanics in phase-changing electroceramic electrodes through mechanistic studies of defects-charge coupling at the lattice scale, phase-stress coupling in single particles, and statistics of the particle network in the composite electrodes of sodium-ion batteries. The research is based on the hypothesis that: (i) the breakdown of the local structural symmetry not only induces lattice distortion and stress gradient at the nanoscale but also impacts the charge distribution in the lattice, (ii) the stochastic nature of material defects is coupled with the phase inhomogeneity in the single particles that gives rise to a stress/strain profile largely deviated from the conventional core-shell pattern; and (iii) in composite electrodes, the charge heterogeneity, mechanical damage, and electrochemical activities co-evolve, resulting in a dynamic ionic/electronic network in the cell. Following the hypothesis, the project includes the following research tasks. (i) Quantify the defect characteristics and map the defects-charging-composition at the nanoscale using controlled synthesis, synchrotron analytical techniques, and computational modeling. (ii) Understand the phase-stress coupling in the single electroceramic particles using the designs of grain engineering and surface coating. (iii) Identify the characteristic metrics of particle network in composite electrodes using machine learning, understand the dynamic evolution of particle network under operating conditions, and interpret the impact of mechanical degradation on battery performance. Overall, the research spans the basic understanding from the lattice scale up to the composite electrode and lays a foundation of mechanistic understanding of chemomechanical degradation in energy storage materia<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Satellites are a crucial provider of Earth observational data to various end users across defense, agriculture, energy, and other broad markets. Fundamentally, the frequency and latency of this data depends on the rate of downlink availability of the satellites. This means satellites in lower orbits, or many more satellites in higher orbits, can provide more frequent ?new? data to end users. CubeSats, or satellites about the size of a shoebox, could provide more coverage and better data frequency than larger satellites for lower cost if they are able to maintain their orbits for long durations (greater than 1 year). This longevity requires a propulsion-equipped CubeSat bus to be developed for use in orbital remote sensing. The potential impacts of this technology are targeted towards the global satellite market and the downstream end-users of satellite data though there may be additional applications in biomedical and microfluidic markets as well.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an entirely solid-state, flow-controlled, electric thruster system for use in CubeSats. This class of satellite is typically only in orbit for about a year and is rarely utilized for commercial space applications due to lack of propulsion capabilities and orbital limitations on lifetime. The core technology is a solid-state flow control device developed to offer the same level of fluid control and precision as is available on much larger, pressure-driven mechanical propulsion systems currently used on many much larger commercial satellites. A digital microfluidic device has been researched, developed, and tested in a lab environment to confirm feasibility. This technology offers the ability to repeatably flow and stop flow of liquid propellants to electrospray thrusters in a vacuum environment without the need for much larger pressure systems or mechanical valves, minimizing the impact of previous scaling limitations for satellites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research is needed to better understand decision-making in the face of unique economic, environmental, and social risk factors near protected areas that inhibit household resilience, thereby exacerbating natural resource management conflicts. The need for such understanding is particularly urgent in lesser developed regions of the tropics, where communities near protected areas often face extreme poverty. To address this need, this research in Sub-Saharan Africa investigates how the ability to recover from economic, environmental, or climate change-related shocks can be influenced by individual and household decision-making around livelihoods strategies, and the resource management implications of decisions to take on or mitigate risks.<br/><br/>Linking behavioral economics, human behavioral ecology, and resilience studies, this research is guided by the following overarching question: How do individual and household decisions made in negotiation of risks influence livelihoods outcomes? More specific research questions and hypothesis tests assess the following: 1) how households in park-adjacent communities define and evaluate desirable resilience from their own perspective; 2) the relationship between socioeconomic status, risk preferences, and subjective resilience for households in park-adjacent communities; and 3) how integrated conservation-development interventions can be targeted to improve household outcomes like subjective resilience. The transdisciplinary, mixed-methods data collection and analysis plan is qualitative, quantitative, and spatial in nature. This research tests competing explanations of risky decision-making, such as prospect theory and risk-sensitive optimal foraging theory, in a novel setting of natural resource conflict, multidimensional poverty, and proximity to protected areas. The study also advances resilience theory through the application of its subjective measure. Finally, this research addresses a literature gap in explaining mechanisms through which risk preferences influence household livelihood decisions, and by proxy, environmental conservation outcomes. This work thus illustrates how livelihood decisions and negotiation of risk influence household resilience, yielding broader impacts for conservation and development scholars, practitioners, and policymakers who are involved in designing initiatives that simultaneously advance economic development, community wellbeing, and natural resource management. The resulting behavioral model linking risk preferences, multidimensional poverty status, and decision-making to subjective resilience will be relevant to research undertaken in poor and park-adjacent communities around the globe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This insight will advance the understanding of living systems and has enormous potential in understanding diseases like cancer, where the stickiness and mechanical properties of cells play key roles. Beyond its scientific merit, the research's impact will stretch beyond the laboratory. An innovative, hands-on course that immerses undergraduate students in Biological Physics research, fostering the next wave of scientists, will be designed.

At the heart of this project is the Multi-Axial Entropic Spring Tweezers along Ring-shaped Origami (MAESTRO), a low-cost, high-throughput technology for applying controlled mechanical tensions to individual integrins from multiple directions. MAESTRO leverages the entropic elasticity of single-stranded DNA to generate mechanical tension, the exquisite positional control of DNA origami to control the directions of applied tensions, and device miniaturization to reduce cost and increase throughput. To validate the performance of MAESTRO, the tension-inducing tool will be benchmarked by assessing the kinetics of Holliday junctions under mechanical tension. Measurements will be compared with published data from optical tweezer experiments and theoretical predictions derived from the Boltzmann distribution. Advanced single-molecule methods, including confocal single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) and total internal reflection microscopy, will be used to dissect the intricate signaling of integrins in response to these multi-directional mechanical stimuli.

Concerns about emergent HABs in the region have surged and coincide with reports on toxins present in water and seafood. Major knowledge gaps currently exist on environmental drivers that lead to the development of these blooms and the production of toxins, and associated human health risks. With growing threats to ecosystem and human health, with the increasing frequency, intensity, and range of cyanobacterial blooms, attributable to eutrophication and likely exacerbated by climate change, NC-CAPE will provide data to guide efforts to implement effective monitoring approaches, inform guideline values for safe consumption of water and seafood, deliver predictive tools to assess emergent and future toxin exposure risk, and leverage community engagement initiatives to fill data gaps and improve oceans and human health. NC C-CAPE will provide investigators at all career stages valuable opportunities for collaboration, leadership, cross-training, as well as the foundational support to expand their research programs across disciplinary boundaries. The Center?s Community Engagement Core will use principles central to understanding and addressing HAB exposure and prevention so as to empower community members to conduct critical and systemic inquiry. The Center is committed to thoughtfully recruiting students, postdocs, and staff, and will convene an External Advisory Committee that reflects stakeholders.

Transitional flow causes significant fluctuations in flow parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress, which can precipitate major practical consequences. For example, these fluctuations can accelerate the progression of vascular diseases including heart disease, stenoses, etc.; additionally, they can weaken materials to failure, i.e., expediting the rupture of aneurysms. Thus, to accurately evaluate these biomedical conditions, it is important to consider and quantify the role of transitional flow effects. Unfortunately, transition to turbulence in pulsatile flows remains a poorly understood flow regime. As a result, current studies most often ignore the effects of transitional flow. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a fundamental understanding of the pulsatile transitional flow regime as well as build universal tools capable of estimating its functional effects. This project will also focus on expanding training and educational resources related to experimental fluid dynamic methodologies. Additionally, the vast amount of experimental data collected through this project will be made publicly available and used to establish a globally accessible repository of difficult-to-obtain experimental transitional and turbulent flow data.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish fundamental knowledge regarding the mechanisms that drive transition in pulsatile pipe flow as well as develop first-of-their-kind tools capable of estimating intermittency and transition progression. To date, studies exploring this flow regime have been limited to one-off contributions and produced contradictory findings. The lack of consensus and understanding of this flow regime has increasingly led to biomedical studies controversially asserting flows with mean Reynolds numbers as low as 250 as being transitional in nature. This punctuates the urgency of addressing the critical knowledge gap in this domain. This project delivers on this need using a rigorous series of experimental particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) studies. The project will focus on three specific aims: (i) Investigate the role of axial flow factors including frequency of pulsation and input pulsatile waveform shape on transition to turbulence; (ii) Assess how the onset and development of transition to turbulence is sensitive to radial-flow instabilities such as pipe curvature or cross-sectional area occlusions or expansions; (iii) Develop analysis tools to estimate intermittency, transition progression, and expected fluctuation levels of key flow parameters (e.g., pressure) for any arbitrary flow. This effort will represent the first comprehensive suite of experimental studies in this domain as well as the first experimental studies to jointly and parametrically evaluate axial and radial flow factors that affect pulsatile transition. This project is expected to dramatically advance the current understanding of pulsatile transitional flow as well as establish translatable tools to enable future studies to quantify the presence and effects of this flow regime in any application area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The global market size of hydrogen was $155B in 2020 and is expected to reach $317B in 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 9.3%. Different sectors, including transportation (light, medium, and heavy fuel cell vehicles), industry (oil refining, metals refining, biofuels, ammonia, and synthetic hydrocarbons), and storage (natural gas supplementation and seasonal energy storage) are the main customers of hydrogen. Conventional methods of hydrogen production are expensive and release pollutants into the environment. The proposed technology has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, helping overcome environmental challenges like global warming. Different industrial sectors can use green hydrogen at a reduced cost, and the technology will use renewable sources of energy for hydrogen production, leading toward sustainable development. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of electrolyzers for green hydrogen production using thin film composite (TFC) membranes. In the proposed technology, TFC membranes (e.g., reverse osmosis membranes) are used instead of more expensive proton exchange membranes (PEMs) to address the high cost of green hydrogen production by electrolysis. From a technical point of view, using a TFC membrane in the electrolyzer has several advantages. First, it could limit the transport of salt ions while allowing protons to pass, making charge balance between electrodes. Second, utilizing the TFC membrane in the electrolyzer could restrict the gas transfer between chambers (anolyte and catholyte) and allow hydrogen gas production. Moreover, initial investigations indicate that TFC membranes have acceptable performance for water electrolysis compared to commercial ion exchange membranes. This technology will employ renewable energy sources (e.g., solar energy) for seawater electrolysis. As a result, it could be possible to produce green hydrogen at a reduced cost without greenhouse gas emissions to the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 70% of an animal agriculture operation?s variable cost of production is the cost of feed.  However, there are few approaches that allow producers to measure their animals? feed intake, and the limited number of locations that have that capacity are expensive.  The proposed low cost, on-farm tool would allow farmers to identify potential replacement animals that are more efficient, improve how they manage animals in the feedlot and to quantify intakes of animals grazing pasture.  Currently there is no way for pasture animal intake to be determined when animals are grazing at scale.  If 5% of US beef producers made use of this tool that would be 40,000 operations and likely improve the management decisions related to upwards of 500,000 to a million cattle.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a predictive algorithm to make use of daily animal weight and water intake, along with weather data, to predict daily feed intake. The proposed tool has been trained using data from a specialized feeding barn that has equipment to measure feed intake as well as animal weight and water intake.  Currently, state-of-the-art systems significantly over- or under-estimate the actual feed intake. The proposed tool intends to work in situations where either there is not an expensive feed intake system or in extensive grazing pasture situations where weighing feed is not possible.  The system has been validated on ~2200 animals fed in the barn and almost 100 animals grazing small plots where a ground truth can be determined for grazing feed intake.  Results have shown predictions of individual daily feed intake to within 92-95% accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to offer value-added products using less expensive, sturdier, and repairable recycled materials. The recycled plastic products may be more durable in wet environments and easier to clean, which may make them a better value than wood products, especially in the food industries.

Computing systems and algorithms are used in all aspects of the modern world, including healthcare, governance, social media, defense, and business. Recent years have witnessed, a steady succession of ethical failures in the development and application of computer technology. Computing ethics courses have emerged, but as important as these courses are, ethics-education researchers have been increasingly aware of the drawbacks of relying on a single course to instill ethical behavior in students. This project will study the effectiveness of embedding ethics instruction throughout the computing curriculum. The Platform for Ethics and Responsible Computing Education (PEaRCE) will be developed and used to provide realistic interactive scenarios that highlight how to apply ethics in the creation and development of computing systems.<br/> <br/>The development methodology for this project will involve co-designing a wide variety of work-situation scenarios for the PEaRCE platform, in collaboration with computing educators, to fit the topics of their courses. A variety of features in the platform as well as curricular activities will be developed to accompany the PEaRCE simulations, to support educators who may have little or no background in ethics education. The research methodology, and main goal of this project, will be to analyze the impact of PEaRCE on students? ethical awareness as they progress in their use of the platform.  Research studies will involve about 1,000 undergraduate and graduate computing students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and their instructors, and later in computing courses taught at New York University.

These points are thought to be closely related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), but the balance of contributions to North Atlantic carbon accumulation from air-sea fluxes and ocean transports is not well constrained. There is significant uncertainty about what the future holds, both for AMOC strength and carbon uptake as they respond to the effects of climate change and other changing forcings. This project will utilize long-term and ongoing observations across the North Atlantic basin to quantify carbon uptake and carbon transport and the variability in these parameters on the time scale of decades. This work will support a variety of efforts to educate and promote underrepresented groups in ocean science. The project investigators will partner with a variety of institutions in Georgia, Florida and in the Caribbean to educate students at a range of levels. They will promote a carbon cycle education website that includes interactive K-12 education materials. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>The ROCCA project aims to redefine our understanding of the North Atlantic carbon system, one of the world?s most important regions for carbon sequestration on climatically-important timescales. The team will use new estimates of anthropogenic carbon transports across both subtropical and subpolar domains to determine the contributions of air-sea fluxes and ocean circulation to regional carbon accumulation, a fundamental knowledge gap. This analysis will enable evaluation of their combined effects on future carbon uptake as overturning strength is projected to weaken. New observations in Florida Straits will fully characterize the chemical variability in water mass structure on seasonal timescales for the first time, and in combination with air-sea anthropogenic CO2 fluxes derived from transport-divergence/accumulation budgets, the team will validate existing numerical simulations and improve the representation of carbon cycle processes in the next generation of climate models.

Conflict and organized criminal activity sometimes continue after terms to end civil wars are negotiated and agreed. This research investigates the postconflict preferences of militant and criminal organizations, and the strategies they use to achieve their objectives. The research involves interviews with imprisoned leaders who are participating in a peace agreement process. These leaders possess a deep and detailed knowledge of the dynamics of crime and violence including the logics of recruitment, arming, financing, and community relations. This research will use data collected from these interviews to test hypotheses about postconflict conflict and criminal activity. It promises to yield important findings and strategies for reducing violence in postconflict societies, including those that are partners of the United States. The research team will produce scholarly research and policy documents that could contribute to policy formulation in postconflict countries as well as those affected by significant levels of armed groups. The project can also be expected to help scholars, policing organizations, and others better understand the nature of criminal governance and how armed organizations prey on communities as well as provide security and dispute resolution.<br/><br/>Part 2. Scholars have investigated the conditions that lead parties to civil conflicts negotiate peace agreements, and the degree to which such agreements contribute to the end of large-scale hostilities. This literature has devoted less attention to how militant involvement in criminal activities influence these processes. We lack knowledge of the postconflict preferences and strategies of criminal groups, and how these contribute to the negotiation of peace agreements and subsequent levels of crime, violence, and gang activity. The project addresses this gap by collecting data in the form of semi-structured interviews with leaders who have been assembled in a single prison to reach a peace agreement.

Cancer immunotherapies have shown great promise and efficacy in clinical trial studies, with seven being approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); However, manufacturing these cells remains a limiting factor in widespread adoption. Current FDA-approved therapies require up to 250 million immune cells per infusion, with costs for a single dose nearing $500,000. The current manufacturing limitations underscore the urgent need for innovation in cell manufacturing. Prior research with an animal model shows this solution can reduce the manufacturing time for cell therapies by 30% in comparison to the fastest technology on the market. Using this technology, manufacturing directors at biopharmaceutical companies may be able to save space in their facilities and save money on labor and cell culture resources while clinicians at cancer centers are able to treat patients at a faster rate. By addressing time and resource limitations, the technology has the potential to reduce the financial barrier to lifesaving cell therapies, increasing adoption by cancer patients. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a centrifugal fluidized expansion perfusion bioreactor prototype. The bioreactor streamlines the cell expansion process by balancing centrifugal forces with a continuous feed of fresh medium to remove inhibitory waste products and retain cells unlike current solutions. Early research has shown that immune cells from cattle can be expanded, and that the prototype can sustain high cell population densities over 100 million cells/mL, reducing manufacturing time from 7-14 days to 5 days, and maintaining cell growth at 95% of the maximum rate. Moreover, unlike current manufacturing equipment, the bioreactor fits easily on a standard lab bench and is entirely self-contained, with its housing acting as a standalone unit with air filters and ultraviolet-c sterilization?eliminating the need for multi-million dollar cleanrooms. Findings from prior research support the potential impact the device would have on scalability and accessibility of cancer cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural lighting improves well-being and can reduce energy consumption for artificial lighting. The glass under development will darken its tint when needed to avoid uncomfortable glare while maintaining the view. Sunlight also brings energy in the form of heat into buildings and cars, especially through sunroofs. While solar heating can improve energy performance on cold days, the smart glass under development can also block unwanted heating to reduce energy required for air conditioning. To achieve significant gains in energy efficiency, the smart glass technology must be broadly deployed, which requires manufacturing at low-cost. Scalable, low-cost processing will be achieved by coating the active materials from inks over large areas of glass or plastic. By controlling both light and heat, and enabling low-cost manufacturing, the project will reshape the functionality and performance of windows by enhancing comfort and reducing unnecessary energy consumption.<br/><br/>The proposed project will address performance limitations of existing smart windows by separately controlling solar heat gain and daylighting on demand with a low-voltage controller. The project will further enable a dramatic reduction in manufacturing cost of smart windows by allowing solution-based coatings with no high energy processing steps. Nanocrystals of niobium oxide will be coated onto glass and plastic films to develop and validate the performance of rigid and flexible electrochromic devices. These prototypes will demonstrate feasibility for building skylights and windows, and automotive glass applications to improve energy performance and comfort. To overcome barriers to technology development and deployment, the project team will develop a polymer electrolyte formulation that provides sufficient mechanical stability during bending to avoid electrical short circuits while also maintaining rapid optical switching and on-off cycling stability. Transparent conducting substrates will be selected and validated that support uniform coloration during switching, allow access to a high infrared transmissive state, and remain well-conducting during film processing and device assembly. The environmental stability of the prototypes to UV exposure and thermal cycling will be established.

Currently, clean fuels, such as hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels, lack existing distribution and storage infrastructure creating major hurdles to adoption. The proposed technology uses on-board generation of hydrogen to provide a viable alternative to existing battery electric technology that cannot serve certain segments of the heavy-duty vehicle fleet due to weight or operating conditions.  The goal is to provide zero emissions fuel independence for places that are currently reliant on expensive diesel and gasoline deliveries, and may be underserved by newer, cleaner fuel supply chains.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a two-step water electrolysis approach to produce hydrogen on-board a vehicle.   The proposed technology is designed to provide a safer alternative to battery electric technology and solve one of the pressing challenges of using hydrogen as a transportation fuel, which is moving and storing hydrogen.  In addition, the system has a total gravimetric energy density, including the fuel cell, two- to three-times that of commercially available lithium-based battery technologies.  The proposed technology uses activated zinc (Zn) in the first step of the process that produces hydrogen gas and zinc oxide when in contact with water and does not require electricity.  In step two, electricity is used to electrochemically convert the zinc oxide solid by-product back to activated zinc.  This<br/>closed-loop two-step water splitting process is referred to as an electrochemical zinc/zinc oxide cycle. The same activated zinc may be used to produce H2 on-site multiple times using many zinc/zinc oxide cycles, which makes it more cost-effective than current solutions.

This technology is a straightforward attachment to the current device, which can alter the flow and trajectory of the particles towards the tissue. By carefully designing the geometry of our device, we can significantly increase the delivery efficacy by optimizing the aerodynamic flow and creating more focused and even pressure on the plant tissue. Our preliminary data has shown > 20x increase in DNA delivery efficiency to onion epidermis cells. In addition, our design can be quickly modified using three-dimensional printing technology to accommodate plant tissues of different species with different geometries.

This innovative controller is designed to enhance the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources into the electric power grid, including microgrids and smart grids. By enabling voltage source converters to operate over wider ranges, the controller allows for a more effective utilization of energy resources, which is crucial for achieving the U.S. goals of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. The introduction of this controller will reduce the need for high capital investments in power system reinforcements, thereby accelerating the transition to a sustainable, zero-carbon energy future. The application benefits various stakeholders, including manufacturers of grid-interfaced voltage source converters, renewable energy producers, and power utility companies, all of which are pivotal in advancing the nation's clean energy objectives.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a blended integral proportional and proportional integral controller, which exhibits distinct advantages in stability margin and transient response when compared to existing voltage and current source controllers for voltage source converters renewable energy systems. The technology combines the advanced features of both proportional integral-based and integral proportional-based controllers resulting in improved system safety, security and reliability. The research underlying this project includes the creation of versatile two-degrees-of-freedom voltage source converter controllers with plug-and-play capabilities, enhancing power system flexibility for higher renewable energy resources integration. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller not only widens the operating ranges of power systems, accommodating greater penetration, but also maintains cost-effectiveness comparable to conventional controllers.

Most current endoscope designs are larger than their target body region and must be forced through a narrow passage before imaging begins. The small footprint of the proposed Meta-Optical Fiber Endoscope (MOFE) device allows significantly less invasive treatment, reducing the likelihood of complications and the need for anesthesia during the procedure. The MOFE platform also targets other untapped biomedical imaging markets, such as cardiac, deep brain, and simultaneous multi-functional imaging. Additionally, these all-on-fiber structures offer greater potential for large scale and low-cost fabrication than current designs. Rather than requiring the assembly of many individual components, a complete MOFE probe can be realized in a single standard nanofabrication process, representing a substantial reduction in cost per device. The method employed to produce these probes can also be performed on a planarized fiber bundle, allowing hundreds or thousands of devices to be made in parallel. <br/><br/>The proposed project will produce Meta-Optical Fiber Endoscope devices. By using flat optical metasurfaces, i.e. artificial sheet materials with sub-wavelength thickness, no wider than the fiber tip itself, it is possible to replace bulky glass optical imaging components (lenses, mirrors, prisms, etc.) with a device aspect ratio defined by the ultra-thin fiber components. This project will represent the first unification of optical metasurfaces?fabricated directly on-fiber?with other advanced imaging techniques, such as wavefront shaping in multimode fiber, optical coherence tomography, and multifunctional brain imaging, including beta testing of these novel devices. The titanium dioxide nanocylinder metasurfaces used in this project are highly efficient, i.e. over 90% transmission in the visible range, and able to tune the transmitted phase to have full wavefront control. The current prototype will include lensing to a controllable focal length, tunable beam steering, polarization insensitive functionality, and even multifunctionality combining any of the above simultaneously by integrating electrically tunable materials. This project will mark the first integration of high-index visible metasurfaces directly on the fiber endface. The metasurface?s tunability will lead to large field of view imaging, which is not available in existing endoscopy without bulky mechanical scanners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discovery and manufacture of medicines, textiles, plastics, food products, and perfumes depend heavily on chemical dehydrations. These processes combine simpler precursors to make useful products by removing a molecule of water, but they overwhelmingly generate a significant amount of unnecessary and potentially wasteful chemical byproduct to achieve this seemingly simple outcome. Electrical energy is being leveraged to power catalysts that achieve these dehydration reactions in a conceptually new manner that mitigates chemical byproduct formation. Dr. Nacsa is also studying a new teaching method that aims to improve learning outcomes and equity in the context of undergraduate organic chemistry. This course is a prerequisite for physicians, dentists, veterinarians, and a range of engineers, but it often presents a stumbling block to these careers that is seen as intimidating and inequitable. These issues are being addressed through the development of new types of assessments as alternatives to exam-intensive evaluation approaches.<br/><br/>Efficient dehydration catalysts have traditionally been challenging to develop because of countervailing electronic demands throughout catalytic cycles. This challenge is being addressed by the Nacsa research team by using electrochemistry to modulate the oxidation state of sulfur-based organocatalysts. The catalysts are expected to enable nucleophilic substitutions of acids to afford esters and amides, and nucleophilic additions of alcohols to afford ethers, alkyl halides, and amines using electrochemistry to promote catalyst activation and turnover. By avoiding the generation of stoichiometric byproducts usually associated with dehydration reactions, the environmental footprint impact of these types of reactions is expected to be reduced, and the derivatization process is expected to be streamlined in support of a broad array of both discovery and process chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central goal of this CAREER project is to promote 4- to 6-year-old children?s scientific learning through parent-child conversations during book reading interactions. The project will focus specifically on the use of scientific process language in science books and on conversation surrounding those books in supporting children?s scientific reasoning. First, the investigators will analyze a sample of science books currently available to the public using automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) to characterize the general use of scientific process language in them. The investigators will then determine, in a series of experimental manipulations, whether children?s books that have science process language increase science learning by scaffolding parent-child conversation about science. This line of work will derive principles to guide the writing of science books for children as well as insights about how parents can foster science learning.  The research activities will be conducted with rural families ? who are traditionally underrepresented in research and often have limited access to scientific resources ? and will be complemented with an integrative education plan to train undergraduate research interns in early science learning and family engagement in partnership with a school district in rural North Carolina.<br/><br/>This project is structured around three research objectives that combine natural language processing (NLP), direct observations of parent-child reading interactions, and community engagement methodologies. To characterize how scientific language is integrated into existing educational materials, Objective 1 will use NLP to quantify references to scientific processes (e.g., causal relationships, explanations, predictions) within a large corpus of children's science books. Objective 2 involves a series of controlled experiments to examine how variations in science process language books affect scientific conversations and children?s learning. Objective 3 is a pilot study that will leverage findings from Objectives 1 and 2 to develop a science picture book based on rural caregiver?s feedback and test its effectiveness in enhancing parent-child scientific conversation. Expected findings include the development of a multi-level theory of factors that influence early science engagement (e.g., parent-child interactions, features of books, science capital) to be used by researchers as targets for future interventions aimed at fostering children?s scientific learning and engagement. The findings will be disseminated to researchers across disciplines whose work focuses on family processes, early childhood, and science education.

An example of such surfaces is the small, flexible wings on flapping-wing robots that are beginning to approach the scale of natural insects. Removing liquid contaminants from these surfaces using vibration presents an opportunity for autonomous cleaning and drying. However, at these scales, the motion of the sloshing liquid contaminants and the flexible surfaces on which they rest are coupled?the deformation of one influences the other. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of how the motion of a surface impacts the motion and ejection of a liquid drop. This project will provide a foundation by which to adapt self-decontamination strategies to other surfaces vulnerable to droplets, such as those in food preparation and healthcare. This project also encompasses outreach activities to local high school students via science fair project mentoring and research opportunities in the PIs? labs. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to reveal the physics of sloshing liquid contaminates and ejection from surfaces in which the fluid and surface motions are highly coupled. This tightly integrated experimental, theoretical, and numerical study will answer questions in highly interdependent fluid-structure interaction. This project mates two elementary systems?a cantilever and a fluid drop ? to form a dynamically complex system.  Driving the cantilever base causes it to bend and the drop to slosh and/or slide, and the substrate dynamically responds in turn to drop motion. High-speed videography and precisely controlled vibratory input will enable the characterization of drop motion and ejection events in which the solid substrate can exhibit a range of curvatures and accelerations throughout the vibration cycle. Conventional cantilever and elastica dynamics will be augmented with inertia-related non-conservative fluid forces to quantify dissipation, drop coherence, and fluid removal in these non-stationary processes. Numerics will permit the synthesis of coupled fluid- and solid-governing equations to determine the most effective excitation strategy for substrate decontamination. The ability to self-decontaminate adds a new dimension to the multi-functionality provided by flexible wings and will be critical to the functionality of surfaces vulnerable to chemicals, moisture, and biofilms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second, insights and control policies derived for such infinite population models will be applied to large but finite networks, with formal performance guarantees in terms of the network size. This project will illustrate the benefit of this graph limit approach for broad classes of network processes including: i) strategic interactions, ii) multi-agent learning and iii) nonlinear pairwise interaction dynamics. In all these settings the use of low-dimensional graph limit representations instead of unstructured finite networks will result in solutions that are guaranteed to be computationally tractable, asymptotically optimal, and robust in the presence of fast-changing and growing networks. Theoretical results will be validated over real world networks, as well as lab experiments involving swarms of robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The automation function of the technology may also help resolve the labor shortage challenge associated with traditional farming.  Sensor data could reduce pest control costs, which to date has been a major challenge associated with hydroponics farms.  Automated hydroponics growing methods could improve the sustainability of agriculture and support both indoor and outdoor hydroponics growth systems, enabling farmers to grow a rich variety of crops more efficiently. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a contactless miniature laser imaging method to detect precise hydroponics nutrient levels. The contactless sensor detects growth media reflection and scattering efficiency to characterize composition. The technology features integration of multiple sources of data for optimal growth control decision-making. Sensor data includes temperature, humidity, supplied water amount, light, plant stress, disease conditions and water level.  This data is used to generate a smart plant growth model using a deep reinforcement learning method. A chemical-free, ultraviolet-C (UVC) panel will be used to monitor pest control, one of the key challenges of growing organic crops.

The engineering and architecture services sector is critical to the nation, accounting for 2.8% of the U.S. GDP, and bears substantial responsibility for approximately 37% of the global carbon emissions. Structural design and evaluation, pivotal in this sector, serve as the bridge between architectural vision and the realization of construction or maintenance projects. The early stages of design, assessment, and analysis crucially impact a project?s outcome and operational life cycle. Despite this importance, the in-depth exploration of alternative approaches or solutions is typically time and cost-prohibitive, limiting the potential for optimizing project resilience, safety, sustainability, and functionality. Enhancing the productivity, capabilities, and collaborations of structural engineers through artificial intelligence advancements can address these limitations. The envisioned Center for Visual Structural Expertise for Resilience (C-ViSER) will focus on developing foundational machine learning innovations to enhance design and management practices in the built environment. To realize and implement these innovations in practice, the Center will cultivate a diverse workforce skilled in both structural engineering and artificial intelligence. This approach not only fosters scientific advancement but also promotes inclusive development within the structural engineering field and will catalyze wide-reaching benefits for the built environment, economic growth, and societal well-being.<br/><br/>This grant supports planning of a new IUCRC (C-ViSER) comprised of two sites ? Purdue University (PU), and University of Houston (UH) - that have complementary research strengths. UH brings to the Center expertise in generative AI for structural engineering, computer vision for digital twins, synthetic dataset production, robotics and sensor systems, open-source tool development, damage and fracture modeling, and advanced geosensing. The sites will work collaboratively to plan the creation of adaptable, scalable, and accurate end-to-end ML-powered applications to enable structural engineers in their efforts to reliably and efficiently extract meaningful information from their own digital and visual data that can run on the cloud, commercial laptops, and portable devices. The Center?s research will address the industry need for foundational AI systems for structural engineering designed to transform traditional engineering practices for maximum impact. The Center?s activities will be directly relevant to the numerous companies across the nation providing services related to structural engineering, architecture, design, analysis, forensics, maintenance, management, and construction. The broader impacts of the center are to serve society by developing innovations that will result in safer structures, greater confidence in their continued functionality over their lifetime, with less expense and just the right amount of attention dedicated to maintenance and repair.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers wish to understand the processes that drive change in small-scale societies and how socially complex societies emerge over time. A central question is if these processes have a universal pattern, or if they vary from place to place and across different social types. Researchers have documented conditions under which persistent institutionalized social and economic inequalities develop among small-scale hunter-gatherer societies. These include the control of ritual practices, including monument building, as a way to create and sustain inter-generational transmission of wealth and rights to political power. Because controlling people to make things is a commonly recognized measure of political power, building massive earthen mounds often is used as a measure of social and political complexity. Complicated and energetically costly constructions are assumed to reflect greater social and political complexity, hierarchy, and economic integration. Scholars debate the historical processes that give rise to these inequalities; many researchers assert that social change and increasing inequality is an inevitable outcome of material accumulation and defense that enhances social prestige and reproductive success. Native American philosophy, however, interprets increasing complexity as the outcome of interactions among human and non-human agents in an infinitely complicated relational world. In this world, humans have moral responsibility to maintain order and balance realized through ritual actions such as monument building at charged places on the landscape. <br/><br/>The project considers both a widely adopted archaeological assumption that hierarchical control leads to the development of large archaeological sites and compare it to a Native American approach which focuses not on hierarchy but rather community collaboration. The site is perhaps the largest hunter-gatherer site in the world with exceptionally large earthen mounds and ridges, and therefore is an ideal location to investigate if changing hunter-gatherer sociopolitical variation results from the accumulation of economic and labor control over hundreds of years as is claimed, or if building earthworks is a communal activity rapidly undertaken and given freely because Native people have a moral obligation to perform rituals at certain places that ensure balance, harmony, and order. To answer these questions, a multi-disciplinary team will use advanced quantitative and qualitative methods from archaeology, geology, and geotechnical engineering to investigate the history of site use, the pace and duration of earthwork construction, and earthwork building methods. Multi-method analyses allow assessment of whether hunter-gatherer complexity at the site an outgrowth of mutigenerational practices where unequal control of wealth was accumulated slowly encouraging the emergence of institutionalized political and economic complexity. This project provides educational opportunities and professional training to early career Native American scholars, U.S. and international students, school children and site visitors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These very small pieces of matter are called nanoparticles, and these nanoparticles are useful to people. For example, home pregnancy tests use nanoparticles, Covid-19 vaccines use nanoparticles, and state-of-the-art televisions use nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can also be used to deliver materials (e.g., drugs or genetic material) to cells. One challenge with nanoparticles is that they are often very unstable and clump together, and these clumps of nanoparticles do not have the same properties as individual nanoparticles. Thus, this research will create new ways of controlling how nanoparticles clump together. The research is based on prior work showing that tiny pieces of protein can cause nanoparticles to assemble in a reversible way. Thus, the nano-scale properties of the material can be turned on and off based on the presence of the protein. This research will first study different kinds of protein to determine how the clumping and de-clumping occur. The research will then study different kinds of nanoparticles to understand the range of nanoparticle types that can be used. Activities include both laboratory-based research and computational modeling.  A final phase of the research will focus on fungal cells and the interactions of these nanoparticles with fungal cells.  Fungi are important because they can cause disease, be consumed as food, or be used for biomanufacturing. The outcome of this research will be new knowledge about how to store and stabilize nanoparticles as well as new knowledge about how to control the properties of fungal cells with nanoparticles. <br/><br/>Nanoparticles are colloidally stable when the repulsive electrostatic and steric forces are balanced by the attractive Van der Waals forces. Prior work showed that a di-arginine peptide could induce reversible nanoparticle aggregation (and thus plasmonic coupling) by modulating these surface forces. This research will derive a coherent mechanistic understanding of how the peptide length, amino acid sequence, and nanoparticle surface impact this reversible aggregation. Objective 1 will study the structure/function relationship of peptide length and charge: The research will monitor nanoparticle aggregation and resuspension via plasmonic coupling including in biological and environmental media (e.g., saliva and seawater). Objective 2 will change the nanoparticle size to confirm the role of Van der Waals forces and optimize the color change during assembly/disassembly. Objectives 1 and 2 will combine computational modeling and laboratory assays. Objective 3 will use these lessons learned to measure the interaction and transport of aggregated and free nanoparticles across fungal cell walls as a function of protease expression. This work will create new knowledge in different domains: 1) how plasmonic materials assemble and disassemble; 2) how to store nanoparticles in a dry and aggregated state; 3) how to redisperse nanoparticles in biological and environmental media; and 4) how aggregated and free nanoparticles interact with fungal cells and fungal proteases. PI Jokerst and Co-I Miller will create ?plasmonic pride flags? via different plasmonic nanoparticles and teach the underlying science to a Hispanic Serving Institution in SanDiego as well as LGBT+ advocacy groups. Through these student groups, the PIs activities will help retain LGBT+ students in STEM.

Experimental research, however, rarely identifies specific, transferable STEM instructional practices, because STEM education research has typically implemented student-level randomization far more than it has implemented teacher-level randomization. A major barrier limiting scientific progress is the lack of a large-scale trialing infrastructure that can support teacher-level randomization and experimentation, given the logistical constraints of recruiting multiple sites and successfully randomizing at the teacher or classroom level. Challenges in three major areas need to be addressed before such a teacher-level trialing infrastructure could be built. These are: (1) optimal research-practice partnerships that maintain standing research agreements; (2) research design issues such as statistical power and contamination; and (3) data sharing, merging, analysis, and reporting in a large network of participating schools and teachers. A cross-cutting set of challenges, relevant to all three areas, involves training of experimenters to conduct relevant and ethical field experiments, addressing diversity and inclusion in the researchers and participants, and maintaining a fair and equitable governance structure. <br/><br/>This Midscale Research Infrastructure Incubator will launch a two-year, accelerated process to address these challenges and develop a consensus plan for a STEM-teacher-focused trialing platform. Stakeholders will be from diverse communities, including STEM educators and administrators; teacher professional learning organizations; pre-service teacher training programs; statistics and data science; and the social and behavioral sciences. Through large-group meetings and focused task forces, plans for an infrastructure will be developed by addressing each of the three major areas, as well as the cross-cutting issues. The project output will include working papers and prototypes that can serve as a ?blueprint? for a large, open trialing infrastructure.

Martin Conference Center at the Harvard Medical School on October 17-18, 2023.  This long-standing Harvard T. H. Chan School Public Health Program in Quantitative Genomics Conference series focuses on timely interdisciplinary discussions on emerging statistical and computational challenges in genetic and genomic science. The focus of each conference evolves in parallel to scientific frontiers.  A key feature of the series is its interdisciplinary nature, where quantitative and subject-matter scientists jointly discuss statistical and quantitative issues that arise in cutting-edge genetic and genomic research in human diseases. Conference participants critique existing quantitative methods, discuss emerging statistical and quantitative issues, identify priorities for future research, and disseminate results. Diversity in genetic and genomics has been increasingly embraced not only for enabling more powerful studies but also because of the need to avoid further exacerbation of structured inequalities in healthcare systems and to chart a path forward for their amelioration. Significant effort has been made in recent years to improve study participant and workforce diversity in genetics and genomics, including the inclusion of diverse groups in discovery and functional studies and translational efforts to empower or pave the road for equitable clinical impact. The 2023 conference will provide a platform to engage inter-disciplinary researchers to have in-depth discussions on the quantitative challenges and opportunities in increasing diversity in genetic and genomic research. We will make serious efforts to recruit junior researchers, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, in particular underrepresented minorities and women, as speakers and participants.  <br/><br/>The impetus for the 2023 conference theme comes from the pressing need to address the statistical and quantitative issues in diversity in genetic and genomic research. The three topics of the conference include (1) Diversity for gene mapping and studying variant functions; (2) Diversity for translational genetics: polygenic risk and clinical implementation; (3) How do we move forward while acknowledging the past? Examples of the first topic include multi-ancestry genetic association tests, fine-mapping, and eQTL analysis. Examples of the second topic include trans-ethnic polygenic risk prediction and transferred learning. Examples of the third topic include enhancing transparency in the use of population descriptors in genomics research and building global collaborative genetic research frameworks. The education and research activities discussed at the conference will make important contributions to advance efforts on increasing diversity of genetic and genomic research, and will help create the scientific basis and workforce required to ensure and sustain US competitiveness both economically and technologically, prolonging and saving lives, and promoting national security.

Andrews Experimental Forest is an internationally known center for forest and stream ecosystem research in central Oregon and is part of multiple research networks, including the Long-Term Ecological Research network where scientists and NSF have invested in long-term research programs about environmental change. In the fall of 2023, a major wildfire burned over much of this forest, threatening adjacent communities and destroying existing research plans and projects. The scientific community must immediately reimagine their research at the same time that the local community has to reimagine its preparation for future wildfires. This moment provides a short window of time to gain important insights into public engagement with science. With declining trust in science, it is critical to better understand approaches to involve the community in scientific research agenda setting. Public engagement with science researchers and practitioners are making important advancements in this area of work, including strengthening approaches that emphasize reciprocity and relational objectives, and creating opportunities for scientists and publics to listen to each other and feel heard in the co-production of knowledge. However, recent research about co-production of knowledge identifies a gap in evidence about how co-production for actionable knowledge related to complex environmental challenges actually happens, and how best to address tensions and challenges that can accompany such a process. To address each of the needs detailed above, this RAPID project will 1) facilitate local community public engagement with the scientific research community; 2) facilitate consideration of local community interests and priorities in the development of the new long-term research program; and 3) study the impact of a community engagement process on the scientists, the participating publics, and the long-term research plan itself. The knowledge generated from this project will immediately inform and help align H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest?s research agenda with the local rural and economically disadvantaged communities? priorities, a change that will reverberate for decades to come. It will also provide an evidence-based example for others that, given the influential thought leadership in these research communities, will likely be emulated by other long-term ecological research programs, Experimental Forests, and other STEM research organizations, particularly the environmental research networks, field stations, and marine laboratories of the U.S. <br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between Oregon State University and McKenzie Watershed Council comprised of ~25 partners representing local residents, commercial recreational interests, rural schools, conservation organizations, utilities, and local, state, and federal government entities. Additional leadership comes from the Director of H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. The facilitation and research components of this project employ the SCRREE framework developed through research and practice in the field of Public Engagement with Science. According to the SCRREE framework, effective public engagement with science is: Strategic, Cumulative, Reciprocal, Reflexive, Equitable, and Evidence-based. A series of approximately five community conversations, and interviews with approximately 30 scientists, staff and leaders, and community members will be immediately analyzed, summarized, and discussed with the larger research team to inform the research agenda development process. The study will use a single-case case study design with five elements: 1) community mapping, 2) community conversations, 3) interviews 4) observations of the research planning process, and 5) document analysis. Interview, observation and document data will be analyzed using thematic coding with pre-determined coding rubrics also grounded in the SCRREE framework, while allowing for additional emergent themes. Results will be shared back to the local community and H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest staff, research community, and networks. For additional national dissemination, the project will submit two peer-reviewed articles to open-source journals. <br/><br/>This RAPID project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To exploit previously undiscovered weaknesses and conduct more effective attacks, cybercriminals take advantage of the rising number of workers accessing business networks from home through a virtual private network (VPN) while working remotely. Current ransomware countermeasure solutions are not comprehensive and generally fail in tackling sustained and persistent attacks. Moreover, the current solutions track threats only at the operating system level and can be disabled. This solution features universal awareness based on a combination of characteristics related to user, ransomware, non-specific environment indicators, and non-ransomware metrics. The comprehensive ransomware detection, remediation, eradication, and data recovery solution enable unmatched protection from cyberattacks and allow timely detection and shutdown of cyberattacks thus, significantly reducing the amount of compromised data. This enhanced protection will have security benefits for a wide range of critical infrastructures, ranging from energy and finances to the protection of medical data.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an advanced ransomware countermeasure (ARC) platform which will represent the most advanced and effective protection against ransomware attacks.

These two events are connected for synergistic purposes; junior researchers will be invited to the conference to learn more from more senior researchers, where they can present their own work in a poster session, and they can stay for the summer school for a more in-depth study. Thus, organizing the two events consecutively will provide enhanced opportunities for junior researchers to network, share their results, and learn from their peers and more senior researchers. The organizers have dedicated a substantial portion of the conference budget to the participation of early-career mathematicians. They will make special efforts to invite and encourage the participation of women and members of other underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>The topics to be discussed at the conference will include, but will not be limited to, the following important developments in harmonic analysis in recent years: the Fourier restriction and Bochner?Riesz problems; decoupling inequalities and local smoothing problems in Fourier analysis and their applications, applications to geometric measure theory; inequalities of Brascamp-Lieb type; sparse domination inequalities and their application to weighted norm theory; analysis problems for the Hamming cube; subelliptic partial differential equations and generalized pseudo-differential operators. The spring school will focus on the exciting and active area of multilinear singular integrals with applications to ergodic theory.<br/> <br/>More information may be found at the conference webpage, https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/mlha-2024/home.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an example, given a description of a quantum mechanical system, can one efficiently compute the energy of the system? Problems such as this one have become increasingly important since the advent of quantum computing, the area of computer science which uses the strange properties of quantum mechanics to design computers which are potentially faster than the computers we have today. The study of these problems has revealed deep and unexpected connections between theoretical computer science and physics, and the goal of this research project is to further explore and strengthen these connections. As a part of this project, the investigator will mentor graduate students, write and disseminate new educational materials including course notes and a textbook, and design new graduate-level coursework on these topics.<br/><br/>This project has four sets of broad goals. The first set of goals seeks to determine the difficulty of computing various properties of nonlocal games, which are simple cooperative games important to the foundations of quantum mechanics. The second set of goals seeks to understand to what extent one can compute various properties of physical systems described by local Hamiltonians, such as their ground state energies; specifically, the interest here is in understanding how well classical optimization techniques such as semidefinite programming perform at these tasks. The third set of goals is to determine the difficulty of computing the most general of quantum tasks, such as implementing a generic unitary operation, and whether these tasks can be shown to be harder than any classical computation. Finally, the last set of goals pertains to understanding how well one can learn properties of quantum states by measuring identical copies of the states, and whether one can improve on state-of-the-art algorithms in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such plastic upcycling is especially valuable when it can be achieved at moderate temperatures in energy efficient processes. Catalysts offer a route to that end by lowering reaction temperature and selectively directing conversion of plastic to products that serve as building blocks for a broad range of fuels, consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, and building materials, to name a few. Zeolites are a class of porous crystalline catalysts that are especially suitable for waste plastic deconstruction, but further research and development is needed to improve their efficiency, product selectivity, and durability. Thus, this project investigates key design factors that affect the overall effectiveness of zeolite catalysts for the breakdown of a prevalent class of waste plastic, polyolefins. The project is supported by integrated educational and outreach activities aimed primarily at undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>While catalysts are ubiquitous in the production of fuels and important chemical intermediates, the design of advanced catalysts that possess high reactivity, selectivity, and stability remains paramount for efficiently and sustainably abating pollution while lowering energy demands and decreasing carbon emissions. Here, this rational design is employed in the hydrocracking of polyolefins using bifunctional metal/zeolite catalysts, where zeolitic voids simultaneously provide high reactivity and tailored selectivity, but limit catalyst efficiency and stability due to diffusional constraints of bulky products. Hierarchical zeolites with hybrid pore structures can be utilized to address this inaccessibility of bulky polymer molecules, but the direct effect on reaction and deactivation mechanisms, especially of these complex multiphase systems is not well-established. The project thus aims to engineer hierarchical (bifunctional) zeolites in selective hydrocracking of waste polyolefins, based on hypotheses that enhancements of hierarchical structuring affect reaction and deactivation rates for polyolefin cracking beyond simple diffusional impacts and include effects of pore structure (i.e., zeolite framework), connectivity, communication (metal:acid balance/proximity) and reactions occurring within the mesoporous regions and surface protons. By combining synthetic protocols with detailed reaction pathway and deactivation analysis, the project will reveal new insights on how shape-selectivity and transport phenomena affect the performance of these hierarchical, bifunctional catalysts for transformation of waste polyolefins into useful products. Those insights will aid in understanding the entire catalytic lifecycle, including specific mechanistic details that can be extended to improve catalyst efficiency for reactions of various feedstocks related to hydrocarbon and oxygenate processing (i.e., biomass, renewable alcohols, or CO2) and different zeolite or zeotype architectures. Research results from this award will be proactively incorporated into an undergraduate elective entitled Green and Catalytic Chemistry that will incorporate interactive components like hands-on catalysis (plastic upcycling and aqueous pollutant degradation) and separation (CO2 capture) experiments, and ?Sustainability Spotlights? based on media articles covering energy and climate related topics. The project will also strengthen the broader catalysis community through ?CatChats? for younger graduate students in catalysis labs at various universities. These meetups will create a supportive network of peers, via initial virtual connections that will be expanded at conferences, workshops, and other in-person venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research exploits the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene, an emerging two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterial, within a pure copper matrix. Fundamental multiscale and multi-physics studies will be performed in order to understand the fabrication and properties of graphene-copper composites critical to the achievement of scientific and technological advancements in high conductivity materials. The availability of ultrahigh conductivity materials meets the ever-increasing demand for high performance electrical conductors in electric vehicles, portable devices, and power grids, which impacts various industries and, hence, the U.S. economy. New experimental methods will be developed for controlling the continuity of graphene networks within a copper matrix to achieve electrical conductivities significantly higher than that of pure copper. The manufacturing approach is generalizable to other carbon-metal composites consisting of low dimensional constituents within metal matrices for improved electrical and structural applications. This project provides interdisciplinary research, education, and training opportunities for high school students to postdoctoral researchers, ensuring participation from women and under-represented minority groups. Educational and research integration activities include developing modular demonstrations and laboratory tours for interactive teaching and learning experiences and offering new interdisciplinary courses and research programs. <br/><br/>Carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotube and graphene, have excellent electrical properties far exceeding those of pure metal conductors such as copper. To exploit these attractive properties, carbon nanomaterials are often dispersed in a copper matrix to fabricate carbon-copper composite conductors. However, these conductors suffer from low electrical performance due to the discontinuous interfaces between the dispersed nanocarbon materials and the copper matrix. This research project seeks to address these technical challenges by developing an innovative manufacturing technique involving chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and growth of continuous graphene films in a pre-compacted copper foam followed by a ?gentle? compression step. The ?gentle? compression ensures that the final densification of the graphene-coated copper foam occurs without damaging the continuous graphene films. This research aims to resolve fundamental questions about (1) the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced electrical properties of graphene-copper composites; (2) the role of the continuity of graphene networks in the composite on their overall material properties; and (3) size-dependent material behavior of the composite besides the direct effect of different graphene-to-copper volume ratios. Overcoming these technical challenges is essential for designing and manufacturing graphene-copper composite conductors with significantly enhanced electrical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aerosols influence climate as they form the basis of clouds and are engaged in both the scattering and the absorption of sunlight. Aerosols can also negatively affect air quality and provide a vehicle for the spread of airborne disease. The specific environmental impact associated with aerosols depends upon the chemical composition and phase state of the aerosol particles. Inadequate knowledge of the phase state of organic-inorganic aerosols, such as those found in the environment, represents a source of uncertainty in climate and air quality models. Mixed organic-inorganic particles can form a range of phase states depending on environmental conditions; these include liquid and solid phases, and amorphous phases, such as viscous liquids, glasses, and gels. This project will explore the formation of amorphous phase states in aerosol particles and characterizes the properties that determine their impacts in the environment. This collaboration between UC Riverside and Trinity University will facilitate undergraduate and graduate research across both institutions and seeks to provide for an improved understanding of aerosol chemistry across a range of scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>To enhance knowledge of aerosol particles in the environment, this project is a collaborative study between teams at an R1 public university, UC-Riverside--the James Davies research group--and at a predominantly undergraduate liberal arts and sciences university, Trinity University--the Ryan Davis research group--will examine the role of temperature and relative humidity on the phase state and associated properties of internally mixed organic-inorganic aerosol particles. Aerosol particles containing mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds exhibit complex phase behavior in response to changes in relative humidity (RH) and temperature due to hygroscopic interactions. The phase morphology of aerosol particles influences their interactions with light, their response to chemical processing due to changes in viscosity, and their ice and cloud nucleating potential. This proposal will investigate the phase morphology and associated rheological properties of internally mixed organic-inorganic aerosol particles exposed to controlled RH and temperature conditions. The main objectives are: (1) systematically characterize the hygroscopicity and viscosity of particles containing atmospherically-relevant salts and oxygenated organics; (2) determine the temperature and humidity conditions for the onset of phase separation and correlate with molecular composition; and (3) explore the consequences of viscosity and phase separation on the rate of molecular diffusion. To achieve these goals, single particles of aqueous oxygenated organic compounds and atmospherically-relevant mono- and divalent salts will be levitated using an electrodynamic balance. Optical spectroscopy, microscopy and light scattering methods will be used to identify phase separation while new and established characterization methods will be applied to measure hygroscopic growth, viscosity, and diffusive transport.  The research will help to motivate the next generation of scientists by exposing undergraduate and graduate researchers to the physically rigorous study and characterization of aerosols in a project that relates more generally to climate science research, an area of great societal interest and importance today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the remarkable promise of aligned nanofibers, there is an absence of commercial-scale roll-to-roll aligned polymer nanofiber manufacturing due to diverse technical hurdles. This project connects an academic research team and an established nanofiber manufacturing company to translate technologies that will overcome these hurdles. Beyond its commercial impacts, this project will lead to the development of a new hands-on educational program and provide students with valuable experience and training opportunities in entrepreneurship, technology translation, and innovation.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to enhance the efficiency, throughput, and consistency of parallel track roll-to-roll electrospinning for aligned nanofiber manufacturing. It is hypothesized that computational electrical field models can predict production efficiency. Computational electrical field models will be generated based on manufacturing process parameters. The production efficiency will be measured as the mass of aligned nanofiber output on a roll, divided by the mass of polymer feed into the system. A convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning model will also be utilized to correlate electrical field model images with experimentally measured production efficiency. Computational electrical field models can be generated for hundreds of different parameter combinations at the same time instead of testing only a few parameter combinations experimentally. Therefore, this approach allows for efficient in silico screening of the extensive parameter space associated with this complex manufacturing process to maximize the device efficiency. Optimized devices will be scaled, prototyped, and evaluated, demonstrating the capability of parallel track roll-to-roll aligned nanofiber electrospinning manufacture in a commercial context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, compared to lithium reactions, sodium chemistry poses a considerable mechanical deformation to the electrodes and creates more stress and degradation that compromise battery performance. This project, supported by the Ceramics Program within the Division of Materials Research, seeks to create a fundamental understanding of battery degradation via a close integration of novel experiments, data analysis, and modeling approaches. Such knowledge is crucial to elucidating the aging mechanisms of sodium-based batteries, which synergistically contribute to the development of materials of enhanced reliability for the same applications. The multifaceted collaboration between Purdue and Virginia Tech provides unique training opportunities for developing workforce for STEM related careers, with particular relevance to meeting the demand of the energy industries, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades. The research also provides a platform to continue the recruitment and engagement of future scientists on convergent research skills and entrepreneurial training.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project aims to achieve a holistic understanding of chemomechanics in phase-changing electroceramic electrodes through mechanistic studies of defects-charge coupling at the lattice scale, phase-stress coupling in single particles, and statistics of the particle network in the composite electrodes of sodium-ion batteries. The research is based on the hypothesis that: (i) the breakdown of the local structural symmetry not only induces lattice distortion and stress gradient at the nanoscale but also impacts the charge distribution in the lattice, (ii) the stochastic nature of material defects is coupled with the phase inhomogeneity in the single particles that gives rise to a stress/strain profile largely deviated from the conventional core-shell pattern; and (iii) in composite electrodes, the charge heterogeneity, mechanical damage, and electrochemical activities co-evolve, resulting in a dynamic ionic/electronic network in the cell. Following the hypothesis, the project includes the following research tasks. (i) Quantify the defect characteristics and map the defects-charging-composition at the nanoscale using controlled synthesis, synchrotron analytical techniques, and computational modeling. (ii) Understand the phase-stress coupling in the single electroceramic particles using the designs of grain engineering and surface coating. (iii) Identify the characteristic metrics of particle network in composite electrodes using machine learning, understand the dynamic evolution of particle network under operating conditions, and interpret the impact of mechanical degradation on battery performance. Overall, the research spans the basic understanding from the lattice scale up to the composite electrode and lays a foundation of mechanistic understanding of chemomechanical degradation in energy storage materia<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, seawater is becoming more acidic waters and lower in oxygen levels, affecting many sea creatures. These changes can harm fish, and thus the fishing industry, but threatens ocean biodiversity more generally. Additionally, harmful algal blooms, which can be toxic, are occurring more frequently, presenting risks to both sea life and human health. It is important to understand better the physical and chemical processes that are involved in these changes. This project aims to precisely do that by using advanced computer models and real-world data while training young ocean scientists.<br/><br/>Contemporary global ocean biogeochemical models have limitations in computational power and are unable to capture small-scale ocean phenomena, such as small scales currents (of size 100m to 1km) and the influence of surface waves. Yet, emerging research indicates that these small-scale processes have a significant impact on ocean chemistry and life. Notably, the role of surface gravity waves appears to modify small-scale motions. Including wave effects could substantially improve simulations of the ocean's chemistry, but direct measurements of these fine-scale ocean characteristics are rare and difficult to obtain. The difficulty makes numerical models an indispensable tool for exploring these small scale features. This project focuses on the California Current System and will resolve some of the very small features and wave dynamics. The results from these simulations will inform future measurement and sampling plans, help to evaluate the impact of waves on marine chemical cycles, and refine how these effects can be represented in broader climate models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CSM affects over 8.1 million Americans, and is caused by age-related degeneration in the spinal column, leading to severe symptoms including neck pain, motor issues, and in extreme cases, paralysis. The current standard treatment, posterior cervical decompression and fusion (PCDF), leaves the spinal canal unprotected and the muscles unattached, often resulting in complications including adjacent segment disease.  The proposed technology is designed to provide an effective solution to prevent spinal cord compression post-operation - a critical factor in reducing postoperative symptoms and minimizing the risk of recurrent myelopathy for patients with CSM.  By providing immediate structural stability at the cervical fusion site and reducing the mechanical load on neighboring levels, this proposed device may offer a potentially impactful intervention.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a medical device designed to reduce complications arising from traditional posterior cervical decompression and fusion (PCDF) surgeries in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) treatment.  The proposed technology is designed to be utilized with current posterior spinal fusion kits. The hinge pairs can be added at multiple levels and are attached to the rods used in PCDF, not impeding the surgical workflow. This can be suited for multilevel approaches where hinge pairs are added to the midline rod and angulation, if the pairs can be adjusted according to patient anatomy. The proposed device is a multi-level crosslink connected via a central rod for integration with present posterior spinal fusion kits that protects the spinal cord posteriorly after removal of the spinous processes, provides stability to the fusion construct, and reestablishes the midline keel to prevent muscle recollection and kyphosis postoperatively. The device serves as an artificial spinous process and hinged horizontal crosslinks that ensure structural stability and load-sharing at the fusion site while allowing for patient-specific width adjustments of the system. The device may limit the risk of spinal cord compression after PCDF and address the slow-onset swelling and fluid accumulation following operation. The goal is to reduce postoperative symptoms and trauma risk by recapitulating the lamina, and retaining separation of the left and right muscle compartments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project targets advancing plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) technology, focusing on enhancing lean-flame stability and reducing pollutants in real-world scenarios. Current understanding of PAC, including its impact on emissions and its scalability, is incomplete. Prior work has demonstrated that nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasmas can extend the lean blowout limit of hydrocarbon and ammonia flames and mitigate instabilities. However, the impact on NOx emissions remains unclear, especially considering the competing effects of lean-burning and emission production by the plasma itself. A significant gap exists between fundamental chemical kinetic studies and practical applications, with research on industry-relevant platforms often resorting to trial-and-error approaches. This project aims to bridge this divide, connecting knowledge from 1D laminar systems to industrial parameters, including lean blowout limit, combustion dynamics onset, and emissions. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to deepen our understanding of plasma-assisted lean flame stabilization and NOx production and apply this knowledge to CO2-free fuels, including hydrogen and ammonia. More specifically the project will evaluate the hypothesis that the efficacy of plasma strategies for ensuring the static and dynamic stability of turbulent flames is intrinsically linked to the impact of plasma on fundamental flame parameters, such as the laminar flame speed and the extinction strain rate. The project will develop numerical models for plasma-assisted flamelets, and correlate experimental data on lean blowout extension and suppression of combustion dynamics of plasma-actuated swirl-stabilized burners to fundamental flame parameters, for a range of fuels (NH3, H2 and CH4 blends) and operational conditions. The second goal focuses on optimizing NOx emissions in these systems. Rather than simply extending the lean blow-out limit, the project proposes direct emissions optimization, using the 1D flamelet platforms. A parametric exploration will identify optimal regions for emissions reduction using plasma. A third goal complements the 1D picture by considering higher-dimensional effects. The project integrates an education and broadening participation plan, leveraging internal programs at the department and institute level at MIT.

These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands as well as their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. In 2005, the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) was created to examine the role of changing soil climate and vegetation on peatland C cycling. Over the past fifteen years, core data has been collected on soil moisture and temperature, plant composition and amount, and the fluxes of important atmospheric gases emitted (as methane and carbon dioxide) from water table treatments that simulate floods and droughts. A key result from this group's prior investigations was that C emissions from this experimental site appeared to be high, regardless of water table position, revealing that interactions among changes in plant species composition in response to the treatments were strongly controlling the ability of this ecosystem to retain C.  This is a five-year renewal of a Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project, DEB-1354370. The study is examining the interactions among changes in hydrology, plant species composition and changes in climate (particularly flooding and drought) in controlling C storage in this peatland complex; this work is necessary for understanding the consequences of an altered climate for C cycle processes.  Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will all be trained and in field and laboratory techniques. Results from the research will also be incorporated into new high school curricula for use in the Fostering Science summer camp.<br/><br/>The current view of peatland carbon cycling is that the majority of soil carbon mineralization occurs in the relatively shallow aerated peat layer above the water table (acrotelm), and that deeper peat carbon occurring in anoxic layers (catotelm) undergoes minimal decomposition. As such, the position of the water table (and the associated thickness of the acrotelm) is used as a predictor of overall decomposition rates and long-term peat accumulation rates. However, findings from this team's fifteen-year manipulation of water table position in an Alaskan fen (Alaska Peatland Experiment, APEX) challenge this view, and in particular suggest that carbon mineralization in saturated peat is faster than previously expected, leading to high fluxes of anaerobic CO2 production. Prior analyses indicated no significant effect of water table position on ecosystem respiration, but it is possible that this result was due at least partially to changes in vegetation that have occurred both under lower (drier) and higher (wetter) water table positions. The initial experimental design could not disentangle the effects of changes in vegetation from hydrology on peat redox and C fluxes. As such, understanding the interactive effects of altered hydrology and vegetation on anaerobic decomposition processes, and how this governs the turnover of deep soil C pools in peatlands, was the prime objective of the first phase of LTREB funding. Results during that initial LTREB funding period showed that sedge and Equisetum (horsetail) rhizospheres indeed had oxidizing effects on peat and dissolved organic matter. However, persistent flooding over this period of research has presented key gaps in mechanistic understanding of controls on trace gas production in this system, and revealed that plant community structure and the dominance of algae likely have unique controls on soil redox processes and C fluxes. Flooding history also exerted strong control over the relative activity of algae vs. heterotrophic microorganisms, depending on changes in C substrates from different plants. Exactly how changes in plant community interact with altered water tables in governing the supply of electron donors and acceptors, and how this controls anaerobic metabolism in low- and high-water table years, are key questions this collaborative team will examine in the next five years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not only are these early reading differences associated with individual children's academic, economic, and health outcomes, but they also have implications at the national level. By some estimates, low levels of adult literacy may cost the United States $2.2 trillion annually in lost personal income, lower employment, poorer health, and weaker overall economic growth. The primary goal of this project is to develop a reading tool that can help mitigate these negative outcomes. Successful development and commercialization of the tool is expected to promote children's school readiness and early literacy, which lays at the foundation for: 1) greater academic success, 2) higher rates of high school graduation, 3) improved financial and health outcomes. and 4) substantial economic and social benefits at the national level.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an AI tool that will facilitate active conversational engagement, as opposed to passive listening, in the context of joint book reading. The technology generates story-specific prompts at opportune times during a shared reading session for adults to use as conversation starters. Users will be able to select the difficulty level and content of prompts to accommodate the skills, goals, and interests of individual readers. The technology will also be able to operate in any language, thereby maximizing potential reach. Extensive interviews will generate data from both end-users and potential distributors to guide the development and commercialization strategies for this early literacy intervention tool. These interviews will focus on three customer segments: 1) parents of young children (especially those facing socioeconomic, linguistic, or health-related challenges), 2) early education stakeholders (e.g., preschool teachers, libraries, and other literacy-focused non-profit organizations and government agencies), and 3) children's literature publishers and retailers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its five-year duration, the project will fund scholarships to 17 unique students majoring in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Computer Information System, Engineering Technology, or Mathematics. First-year students will receive four-year scholarships and transfer students will receive two-year scholarships. The project team will further support these students? academic success, career readiness, and STEM career placement through bi-weekly STEM seminars, building on the Pedagogy of Real-Talk (PRT). PRT is an evidence-based pedagogy focused on engaging, teaching, and connecting with students through shared personal narratives (Real Talks) and guided activities that build on students? lived experiences (Alternative Lessons). Peer, faculty, and professional mentors will utilize PRT principles. This approach helps create an inclusive and student-centered learning environment that allows all students to feel safe, known, and valued within their chosen academic and career pathway. As one of the only 4-year institutions to have adopted PRT training for both faculty and support staff, FSU is well-positioned to yield valuable insights into the effective application of PRT-guided interventions. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project will increase support for STEM Scholars by offering: (a) scholarships for domestic, low-income, academically talented students with demonstrated financial need pursuing STEM programs (b) bi-weekly STEM seminars that build on a First Year Experience (FYE) course using PRT practices to create a community of scholars; (c) summer internships and undergraduate research experiences; and (d) a PRT-informed mentorship ladder model that utilizes faculty, peer, and professional mentors for each participant throughout the program. These interventions have been developed to support 3 project goals: 1) Improve student recruitment, retention, graduation and progression into STEM careers and/or advanced study 2) Support student sense of belonging, academic success, and career development within their selected STEM discipline 3) Build institutional capacity to establish this PRT-guided STEM career development program for all students. The project will also investigate research questions about the characteristics of the PRT-guided STEM seminars that contribute to the growth of STEM Scholars, the impact of PRT-informed mentorship and seminars on research and internship preparation, and the key characteristics of faculty, professional, and peer mentorship programs that most contribute to student sense of belonging, academic success and career progression. Findings will be shared with the broader academic community to enhance the collective efforts to support student success in STEM. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

This company's innovation signifies a paradigm shift in how society comprehends and manages intellectual property, paving the way for increased value creation and democratizing a system historically marred by complexity, cost, and opacity. Leveraging the inherent characteristics of blockchains?decentralization, peer-to-peer dynamics, transparency, and cryptographic verifiability it is possible to establish an open, efficient, and inclusive system for intellectual property licensing and transactions. This project?s innovation will break down barriers, both legal and economic, for creators across diverse fields, including artists, writers, filmmakers, and scientific and business innovators.  Technical understanding of cost-efficient blockchain based platforms, today one of the biggest barriers to large scale blockchain based use cases, will be enhanced due to the efforts of this project.  Additionally, enhanced technical understanding of composable legal representations and models while maintaining business meaning will be achieved.  The global intellectual property rights market is projected to be $21B by 2029 and the blockchain token/NFT market is projected to be $211B by 2030.  This disruptive enabling technology has significant commercial potential.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the ability to deconstruct intensely complex prose based legal constructs representing intellectual property rights into ?programmable rights units? and operate these units on any blockchain in a compute efficient and cost efficient manner. The objectives are twofold. First, the project will accurately deconstruct prose-based legal documents into composable IP licensing elements, ?programmable rights units,? and represent them in non-lossy semantic meanings.  These deconstructed units must be capable of execution on blockchains in a commercially viable way. Second, the project will demonstrate the ability to implement composable programmable rights in a blockchain-agnostic form.  This objective is crucial for commercial success as the proliferation of blockchains will continue, thus, supporting many blockchains is required for a broad addressable market. These objectives will require usage of modeling techniques, linguistic pattern analysis (natural language processing and otherwise), technical architectural cost impact analysis as well as algorithmic evaluation of leading edge technologies such as zero knowledge proofs and cryptographically independently verifiable artifacts and identities. The anticipated results will be a proven, blockchain agonistic platform that accurately represents the semantic meaning of complex IP rights business models that can be automatically interacted with for executing commercial transactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The engineering and architecture services sector is critical to the nation, accounting for 2.8% of the U.S. GDP, and bears substantial responsibility for approximately 37% of the global carbon emissions. Structural design and evaluation, pivotal in this sector, serve as the bridge between architectural vision and the realization of construction or maintenance projects. The early stages of design, assessment, and analysis crucially impact a project?s outcome and operational life cycle. Despite this importance, the in-depth exploration of alternative approaches or solutions is typically time and cost-prohibitive, limiting the potential for optimizing project resilience, safety, sustainability, and functionality. Enhancing the productivity, capabilities, and collaborations of structural engineers through artificial intelligence advancements can address these limitations. The envisioned Center for Visual Structural Expertise for Resilience (C-ViSER) will focus on developing foundational machine learning innovations to enhance design and management practices in the built environment. To realize and implement these innovations in practice, the Center will cultivate a diverse workforce skilled in both structural engineering and artificial intelligence. This approach not only fosters scientific advancement but also promotes inclusive development within the structural engineering field and will catalyze wide-reaching benefits for the built environment, economic growth, and societal well-being.<br/><br/>This grant supports planning of a new IUCRC (C-ViSER) comprised of two sites ? Purdue University (PU), and University of Houston (UH) - that have complementary research strengths. PU brings expertise  in developing practical, proven solutions to empower engineers and scientists in data collection, data organization, knowledge extraction, and predictive modeling. The sites will work collaboratively to plan the creation of adaptable, scalable, and accurate end-to-end ML-powered applications to enable structural engineers in their efforts to reliably and efficiently extract meaningful information from their own digital and visual data that can run on the cloud, commercial laptops, and portable devices. The Center?s research will address the industry need for foundational AI systems for structural engineering designed to transform traditional engineering practices for maximum impact. The Center?s activities will be directly relevant to the numerous companies across the nation providing services related to structural engineering, architecture, design, analysis, forensics, maintenance, management, and construction.

Some hosts combat such parasitism by actively defending their nests from adult parasites. Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) produce unique ""seet"" calls to warn about the presence of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). In response to seet calls, female warblers return to sit tightly on the nest to prevent cowbird parasitism. This means that, much like words in human languages, seet calls symbolize cowbird parasitism for the warblers. The project?s aim is to understand how hosts perceive and process the acoustic and functional meaning of these symbolic signals by studying the behavioral responses (in the field) and neurophysiological patterns (using fMRI) of warblers to the cowbird?s own calls, seet calls, and other sounds typical of the warbler?s habitat. The grant will train a postdoctoral fellow, three PhD students, one Master's student, and at least eight undergraduate researchers, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will write and share case studies based on their research as open online educational resources for undergraduate courses in organismal biology. Additional broader impacts will include bird banding workshops for the general public, especially during the vibrant migratory seasons in central Illinois and Michigan. Finally, a short 3D virtual reality film-feature will be produced entitled ""A Day in the Life of the Cowbird"", featuring characteristic daily activities of parasitic birds and their interactions with hosts, as seen from the parasite's own eyes' perspective.<br/><br/>Current and past research on alarm calling in animals has often focused on the detailed discovery and characterization of the meaning of referential communication signals. However, the sensory-perceptual abilities of animals to recognize referential calls and the potentially high-level neural processing that ultimately leads to a specific behavioral response have not yet been fully explored. Through integrating field and laboratory experiments and levels of analyses, this research aims to test the overarching hypothesis that referential signaling requires high-level cognitive abilities. Using Yellow Warblers? anti-brood parasitic alarm calls to Brown-headed Cowbirds as a study system, four specific predictions will be assessed regarding that referential calling (i) involves perceptual equivalency of alarm calls and their referents, (ii) is socially acquired but may be modified by personal experience with cowbirds, (iii) involves mental imagery, episodic-like memory, and mental time travel, modifying future behavior so as to decrease risks to fitness, and (iv) is a functionally specific response to obligate brood parasitism. The project couples behavioral and population-level predictions of Yellow Warblers' responses to seet calls with probing of developmental trajectories and neural substrates of referential communication in wild birds via in vivo imaging (fMRI) to repeatedly collect data across development. This integrative research will provide new perspectives on the cognitive ecology and mechanisms of referential communication, including potentially transformative understanding of the neural substrates underlying the perception of symbolic calls, the existence of mental time travel in novel contexts, and the functional substrates of referential signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GSMATH Conference will be held at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX on February 23 - 25, 2024. The conference is organized by GSMATH, which is the regional mathematics alliance covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. GSMATH includes an active and strong network of faculty mentors in over 25 HSIs (Hispanic Serving Institutions), HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), and other institutions that serve a diverse population of students. Building from seven prior GSMATH conferences, it is anticipated that over 100 students and 50 faculty will attend the conference. Student sessions will center on demystifying pathways through undergraduate degree programs in the mathematical sciences. Keynote speakers, panel discussions, a student poster session, and a graduate school fair will provide multiple opportunities for students to network, ask questions, and receive mentoring. The faculty workshop will focus on supporting students as they transition from 2-year and 4-year colleges into graduate education or the workforce.<br/><br/>The GSMATH conference will directly contribute to efforts to broaden participation and promote equity in the mathematical sciences. This, in turn, has potential to improve STEM education and academic outcomes for students across disciplines. Panels like ?What I wish I knew Before Graduate School?, ?Math Careers"", and an undergraduate-graduate student dialogue, will allow participating students to get advice from faculty and experienced peers. The involvement of community college mathematics faculty and students is a critical element of the GSMATH conference, as 2-year colleges are a starting point for many students pursuing bachelor?s and graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The faculty development workshop will not only enable faculty to collaboratively mentor those students throughout the year but will also address critical transition points from CCs to four-year institutions and from undergraduate to graduate studies. Faculty development will also strengthen connections between participating institutions, supporting the growth of a responsive community of mentors across the discipline.

Oysters are an example of such resources and are a vital keystone species directly related to healthy ecosystems, fisheries, and economies. This project provides long-term perspectives on the actions, goals, and institutions that guided oyster management systems in the past while generating data relevant to modern oyster management and restoration efforts. Collaborating with the Tampa Bay Estuary Program and Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, this project provides archaeological baselines from Florida?s largest open-water estuary that can refine habitat suitability models used in management and restoration?a framework that can be applied to estuaries worldwide. <br/><br/>The focus of the project is to examine the evidence of oyster management systems used by Native American societies of Tampa Bay, Florida, and to contrast them with contemporary oyster regulations. By integrating concepts from collective action theory and historical ecology, this study assesses the resilience of the institutions governing oyster reefs across time and space. Envisioning management systems as a combination of selective harvesting practices, tenure systems, and enhancement strategies provides a framework of testable hypotheses. The research draws on previously excavated materials and ongoing excavations at three Woodland period shell-bearing island sites in the lower reaches of the Tampa Bay Estuary. Oyster morphology, stable isotope and trace element geochemistry, and zooarchaeological methods from well-dated contexts are enlisted to provide insights into oyster management systems by estimating the season and environment of oyster harvest, selective preferences, and harvesting rates. Oysters from domestic and public spaces are compared to elucidate potential differences in tenure systems. Archaeological datasets are contextualized by robust datasets of modern oysters from a variety of habitats. The differences in shell morphology between contemporary environments are used to estimate the harvesting habitats of the archaeological shells. This interdisciplinary approach generates new comparative methods and demonstrate the relevance of archaeology in modern estuary management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are composed of special repetitive DNA, proteins, and the RNA version of the DNA. Telomeric DNA can fold into structures called G-quadruplexes, form lariat structures called telomere loops, and form R-loops when it is transcribed into RNA. Solving the unknown structural dynamics during telomere looping and transcription will provide new insights to how telomeres carry out their function of protecting chromosomes, and how aging happens at the cellular level. This project will use a recently developed model telomere DNA system to study DNA structure in real-time, and how DNA structures control telomere looping and transcription. This project will also develop a continuous program that allows high school teachers and students to work in research and teaching laboratories. The inclusion of high school teachers and students is expected to improve the science education on the fundamentals about DNA and RNA. Overall, this project will advance the knowledge of how DNA and RNA works in telomere and propagate basic knowledge of DNA and RNA functions to high school teachers and students. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to understand how the slow folding process of non-canonical secondary structures affects telomere maintenance. This project seeks to characterize the conformational dynamics of telomeric DNA, RNA, and DNA-RNA hybrid complexes by combining single-molecular Frster resonance energy transfer microscopy (smFRET), calorimetry, and CD spectroscopy. This research will advance mechanism-based understanding of (a) how conformational dynamics in the telomeric DNA and RNA affect the formation of telomere loop and end protection, and (b) how telomeric and non-telomeric sequences self-regulate their transcription. The research goals of this project will be addressed by the following specific objectives: (1) Quantify the sequence dependence of G-quadruplex (G4) refolding kinetics; (2) Characterize the structural and conformational dynamics induced by telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2); and (3) Measure the correlation between telomere transcription and TRF2-induced structural changes. The preliminary data from the PI?s laboratory leads to a hypothesis that the slow process of forming a stable G4 in telomeric G-rich ssDNA serves as a biological timer. The outcome of this work will advance our knowledge about how telomeres respond to regulatory factors and the environment, help to reveal the molecular mechanisms of telomere maintenance, and lead to better understanding of cell cycle regulation.

This award will fund a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates program called ?Advanced Computational Research Experiences for Students? or ?ACRES? at Michigan State University (MSU) that will offer students the opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research in computational and data science under the supervision of faculty who are recognized experts in their disciplines. Over 10-weeks, students will receive in-depth training, mentoring and professional development, while being immersed in an active research environment at MSU. They will gain valuable experience in developing their own computationally-focused research project and gain exposure to a wide variety of research problems from different areas of specialty. This project also aims to broaden the pipeline of computational researchers by encouraging participation of underrepresented populations in STEM research, as well as providing early exposure to high performance computing to students from institutions with limited access to HPC resources.<br/><br/>This award provides funding for the ACRES (?Advanced Computational Research Experiences for Students?) REU program at Michigan State University (MSU), which provides a unique training environment for undergraduate students. This program is jointly headquartered by two organizations in MSU.  The first is the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (ICER), who administer MSU?s high performance computing cluster and regularly provide computational training and workshops for MSU students and faculty. The second is the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE), founded in 2015, which brings together applied mathematicians and statisticians who create algorithms, with computationally-minded engineers and scientists who can apply these algorithms in diverse contexts. This type of environment breaks down silos and facilitates the spread of ideas between disciplines. Training in interdisciplinary environments is particularly beneficial to undergraduate researchers. It allows students to draw parallels between research concepts early on, such as the modeling of planetary motion around a star and the simulation of atoms in a plasma. It also provides students with exposure to a wide range of research domains in computational science, which could improve students? enthusiasm for science and students? retention in the scientific pipeline. In this environment, students will develop a broad understanding of research computing and gain experience in applying domain-specific knowledge to computational modeling problems. This project will also broaden participation in computational science by emphasizing the recruitment of women and students from underrepresented groups, and aim to motivate students to pursue careers in computational fields by fostering an inclusive environment.

Computing systems and algorithms are used in all aspects of the modern world, including healthcare, governance, social media, defense, and business. Recent years have witnessed, a steady succession of ethical failures in the development and application of computer technology. Computing ethics courses have emerged, but as important as these courses are, ethics-education researchers have been increasingly aware of the drawbacks of relying on a single course to instill ethical behavior in students. This project will study the effectiveness of embedding ethics instruction throughout the computing curriculum. The Platform for Ethics and Responsible Computing Education (PEaRCE) will be developed and used to provide realistic interactive scenarios that highlight how to apply ethics in the creation and development of computing systems.<br/> <br/>The development methodology for this project will involve co-designing a wide variety of work-situation scenarios for the PEaRCE platform, in collaboration with computing educators, to fit the topics of their courses. A variety of features in the platform as well as curricular activities will be developed to accompany the PEaRCE simulations, to support educators who may have little or no background in ethics education. The research methodology, and main goal of this project, will be to analyze the impact of PEaRCE on students? ethical awareness as they progress in their use of the platform.  Research studies will involve about 1,000 undergraduate and graduate computing students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and their instructors, and later in computing courses taught at New York University.

Several of such processes are known to the community as sprites, blue and gigantic jets etc. These have attracted the attention of several citizen scientists all over the globe. One such phenomenon, which is still not completely understood is referred to as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes or TGFs. During these events, bursts of X-rays with high energy are generated. The main goal of this research is to develop theoretical work that will shed light on the sources of TGFs. This inter-disciplinary work combines concepts of plasma physics as well as atmospheric processes. It may be relevant to the development of new X-ray sources with possible implications on medical imaging processes. The proposed work will result in the training of a graduate student and will be part of the doctorate thesis. <br/><br/>The main motivation for the proposed work results from some recent observations of TGF?s and exploring the underlying physical processes responsible for these events. The core physical process leading is avalanche multiplication of electrons accelerated by force exerted by electric field. In geophysical context the field is generated either as ambient field due to thundercloud electrification or produced by lightning leaders. These electrons gain energy from the electric field and experience quick multiplication in ionizing collisions. In relativistic regime these electrons can radiate energetic photons (X-rays) as they scatter by nuclei of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in air. The radiation is referred to as braking or bremsstrahlung radiation. These X-rays are radiated in all directions and some fraction is radiated backwards with respect to electron motion. These X-rays can produce seed electrons due to photoelectric effect and this leads to strong amplification of the original avalanche.  This process is referred to as feedback process. It was discovered recently that these effects occur on very small spatial scales in good agreement with existing observations. This project investigates the exact physical regimes which lead to observed phenomena. The education and transfer of knowledge will benefit from the proposed activity through the mentoring of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flood hazards are the most prominent stressors for communities in the U.S. and across the world, causing dire physical, social, and economic hardships. Currently, city managers, planners, infrastructure owners and operators, emergency managers, and local and state public agencies are missing critical insights and foresights needed to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from flood hazards. This innovation may form the basis of data products and analytics solutions to inform various flood resilience plans and actions at city, regional, and state levels. In addition, this technology may transform the ability of decision-makers, emergency managers, and flood managers to tailor their strategies and technologies to enhance intelligent resilience in dealing with flood hazards.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software system to reliably and accurately estimate spatial flood risk and property damage caused by flooding in a rapid and automated way.

In addition, the system is designed to automatically map the lowest flood elevation of properties from street view imagery and provide high-resolution and reliable flood risk maps based on examining various hydrological, land use, and built environment features and their interactions.  This technology may improve the reliability and availability of flood risk mapping and also improve the speed and accuracy of damage assessment, enabling local and public agencies, emergency managers, flood managers, and insurance companies to make more informed decisions in their flood resilience efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manufacturing hardware on-orbit can potentially relieve the costs and qualification lead times of space operations by significantly reducing launch costs. However, on-orbit manufacturing will still require inexpensive feedstock. This project?s business approach which is space production from in-space materials addresses this core problem of orbital manufacturing. This project will bring significant transformations to a wide range of space activities, promoting a circular space economy, lowering the cost of orbital power, and simultaneously providing an economic incentive for satellite/debris reclamation, thus mitigating orbital debris and congestion. Providing raw materials sourced in space for on-demand, on-orbit manufacturing holds the potential to increase the economic competitiveness of the US through financially feasible space operations by reducing launch mass, costs, development time, and current payload and size limitations, supporting the US national defense by improving military power projection and logistics resilience, supporting future scientific studies of the solar system and deep space, expanding the limits of long-term exploration missions, and reducing dependence on cargo missions through in situ manufacturing and recycling capability.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel approach for recycling photovoltaics in an orbital environment. The vacuum environment of space will be optimal for many steps in semiconductor manufacturing and can be considered a high-potential application for orbital manufacturing, enabling silicon production to scale well beyond the current constraints of terrestrial vacuum chamber bottlenecks. However, while the vacuum will be beneficial overall to silicon production, nearly every process in modern chemical manufacturing is reliant on gravity and needs to be adapted to function in a microgravity environment. This project focuses on the development of a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) for microgravity analog production of monosilane gas from end-of-life silicon photovoltaics and various hydrogen sources, as it constitutes the most critical step in the silicon production line. Within the scope of this project, particulates produced from PV cells will be characterized, a basic model of the thermochemical reactions will be developed to determine design parameter nominals and a benchtop prototype to characterize the mechanics of particle and gas flows in an analog to microgravity will be developed, establishing its feasibility for in-space processing for the envisioned applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, most synthetic plastics and elastomers are prepared from petrochemicals and are neither biodegradable nor biocompatible. Although some biodegradable polymers have been developed as replacements for petrochemical ones, their synthesis requires different catalysts than those used for petrochemicals that are not well understood. The goal of the Comito research program is to develop a new platform of catalysts for biodegradable polymer synthesis by focusing on the cooperation between multiple metal sites. These studies are focused on finding new catalysts that can be tuned to prepare biodegradable polymers with novel structures, new physical properties, and improved performance. These activities are further being used to train a diverse group of students in organometallic chemistry, catalysis, and polymer synthesis with emphasis on the inclusion of undergraduates, first-generation scholars, and underrepresented groups in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. Moreover, the technical knowledge generated through this research program is being converted into publicly available educational materials for teaching mechanistic analysis to graduate students and reaction mechanisms to undergraduates.<br/><br/>Under this award, Robert Comito and his research team are developing ligands for the proximal coordination of two main group metals for cooperative catalysis toward the controllable synthesis of biodegradable polymers. The hypothesis underlying this research program is that the catalytic polymerization of esters and carbonates by main group metals inevitably involves multi-metallic mechanisms. Considering that metal-bridging coordination of an alkoxide chain end and bifunctional insertion of the monomer feedstock are essential features of chain growth during polymerization, Comito and his group are evaluating the orientation, distance, and substitution of adjacent catalytic metal sites to identify the controlling mechanistic features of main-group catalyzed polymerization that produce unique polymer structures. Applying these skills in mechanistic analysis toward teaching, Dr. Comito is generating drag-and-drop teaching materials that will improve the instruction of reaction mechanisms in a digital format. He is also generating pedagogical materials on control experiments, a class of experiments essential toward understanding mechanisms in science but which are rarely taught in the classroom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During their erosional decay, these diminishing mountains are subject to modification by changing conditions, including climate, basin dynamics, and renewed tectonics, resulting in complex signals. Another factor that controls the evolution of these landscapes is the material properties of the eroding bedrock, which change through time as rocks are exhumed. Correlations exist between topography and rock type in many ancient mountain ranges, including in the Appalachian Mountains, the type locality of this phenomenon. In sedimentary rocks of the Appalachians, the role of bedrock properties is at least qualitatively clear, but in metamorphic rocks the relationships are murkier. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the degree to which metamorphic rocks of the high Blue Ridge control the landscape and to quantify specifically what makes them durable. This will contribute to understanding of the origin of the Appalachian landscape, as well as to the processes that control erodibility along ancient passive margins. This project also supports a program for developing and adding a field experience as a required element for eighth grade Earth Science classes in a rural Appalachian middle school (~350 students/year), where currently no field trips are included in the curriculum. <br/> <br/>The specific goals of this project are to measure bedrock properties of complex metamorphic rock of the Virginia and North Carolina Blue Ridge, including rock strength (e.g., point-load testing), discontinuities (e.g., fracture scanlines), mineralogy, and sensitivity to chemical and physical surface processes via laboratory testing (freezing/thawing, heating/cooling, microwave acid digestion, and slake testing). A large data collection effort (~150 locations, >500 samples) will fill a major data gap for the material properties of complex Blue Ridge rock types. Samples will be acquired from both natural and anthropogenic exposures and will be compared to relative topographic position (i.e., ridges and peaks vs. valley bottoms) as well as a host of other geomorphic metrics. Data will be synthesized to test the degree to which bedrock controls topography and ultimately be integrated into a model of what controls long-term erodibility in this setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When researchers have considered veterans transitioning back into civilian life, the focus has tended to be on their health and how they fit back into society. However, one aspect that is often overlooked is the strong bonds they formed with their fellow service members. How do these relationships affect their memories of their time in the service, and how might they shape their lives after the military? The project trains a graduate student in anthropology, himself a Marine combat veteran with unique access and perspective into this transition. The project has significant Broader Impacts for veteran communities, particularly with respect to the transitioning processes of future Marine corps veterans. The findings from this study will not only be valuable to this particular group of veterans and researchers studying anthropology but will also be shared with the wider Marine Corps community, the National Museum of the Marine Corps, the Veterans Affairs (VA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).<br/><br/>In taking a broader and more detailed look at veterans' social milieu and post military life experiences, this project asks specifically whether the experiences that veterans report differ among those who participate in veteran group events and those that do not. Methods include both individual and collective methods of data collection: in-depth interviews with a representative sample of veterans, and participation in group events where shared military experiences are revisited. Through this, the research aims to understand how the different life paths and occupations of veterans affect how they remember and interpret their time in the military. The project analyzes data to ascertain how common certain health issues are in the group, how their experiences after leaving the military change their memories of service, and how ongoing connections with their military comrades influence their transition to civilian life. The project advances theories of affect, memory, and belonging in psychological anthropology, particularly with regard to the relationship between ritualized experience and subjectivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To prevent an impending collapse, we must recognize the early warning signs. This is particularly challenging in ecological systems due to their naturally complex behavior in both space and time, as well as noisy and/or poorly resolved data. In this project, the investigators will use a novel approach for early detection of impending population collapse, and apply the methodology to spatially distributed populations, for example, a grassland. They utilize a method called computational topology, which can quantify features of a population distribution pattern, such as the level of patchiness in the pattern. In previous work, the investigators used a spatial population model to quantify the changes in a population distribution pattern that occurred as the population went extinct and observed a ""topological route to extinction"". In this project, the investigators will develop and extend the methodology for use in stochastic population models and real-world data sets, which are expected to contain high levels of noise and/or missing/corrupted data. The developed methodology will serve as an additional tool for the prediction of impending population collapse. This tool can then be used by conservation biologists and natural resource managers in order to assist in preserving vulnerable species and ecosystems. The project also supports undergraduate research, and includes recruitment efforts directed at students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>In previous work on data generated by a deterministic population model, the investigators measured changes in topological features (via cubical homology) of population distribution patterns en route to extinction, and observed clear topological signatures of impending collapse. Results with the deterministic model serve as a proof of concept, but in this project, the investigators will study dynamical changes in stochastic population models and real ecological data sets. Transitioning from deterministic to stochastic systems will require substantial development of the methodology, and will require the use of more sophisticated tools, e.g., multiparameter persistent homology. The developed methodology must be able to detect signal in noisy data, corrupted data, missing data, and data that is sparse in space and/or time. Because the topological approach can distinguish fine-scale stochastic noise from large-scale deterministic spatial patterns, it is a promising tool for the analysis of noisy ecological data, and preliminary work using multiparameter persistence shows that it is capable of recovering ""true? dynamical signal (a population distribution pattern) from noise.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Population and Community Ecology Cluster (PEC) of the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of such surfaces is the small, flexible wings on flapping-wing robots that are beginning to approach the scale of natural insects. Removing liquid contaminants from these surfaces using vibration presents an opportunity for autonomous cleaning and drying. However, at these scales, the motion of the sloshing liquid contaminants and the flexible surfaces on which they rest are coupled?the deformation of one influences the other. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of how the motion of a surface impacts the motion and ejection of a liquid drop. This project will provide a foundation by which to adapt self-decontamination strategies to other surfaces vulnerable to droplets, such as those in food preparation and healthcare. This project also encompasses outreach activities to local high school students via science fair project mentoring and research opportunities in the PIs? labs. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to reveal the physics of sloshing liquid contaminates and ejection from surfaces in which the fluid and surface motions are highly coupled. This tightly integrated experimental, theoretical, and numerical study will answer questions in highly interdependent fluid-structure interaction. This project mates two elementary systems?a cantilever and a fluid drop ? to form a dynamically complex system.  Driving the cantilever base causes it to bend and the drop to slosh and/or slide, and the substrate dynamically responds in turn to drop motion. High-speed videography and precisely controlled vibratory input will enable the characterization of drop motion and ejection events in which the solid substrate can exhibit a range of curvatures and accelerations throughout the vibration cycle. Conventional cantilever and elastica dynamics will be augmented with inertia-related non-conservative fluid forces to quantify dissipation, drop coherence, and fluid removal in these non-stationary processes. Numerics will permit the synthesis of coupled fluid- and solid-governing equations to determine the most effective excitation strategy for substrate decontamination. The ability to self-decontaminate adds a new dimension to the multi-functionality provided by flexible wings and will be critical to the functionality of surfaces vulnerable to chemicals, moisture, and biofilms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology is a simple, yet more sustainable and multifunctional structure that can be applied to individual structures, community-based structures, and shoreline environments to minimize erosion, infiltration, and treatment of runoff water. The configuration and geometry of a biologically active pervious structure can be adapted to address individual and site-specific requirements for areas prone to runoff. Biochar can mitigate climate change by reducing soil emissions of greenhouse gases, where one ton of biochar can sequester three tons of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, introducing biochar in concrete block manufacturing can decrease carbon dioxide emissions as compared to producing concrete using 100% Portland type-I cement. The biologically active pervious structure has the potential to control erosion and improve runoff water quality through adsorption, biotransformation, and biodegradation which can prevent contamination of aquifers, waterways, and the environment.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a biologically active pervious structure.

Multifunctional biochar (derived from invasive plants and waste agriculture biomass impregnated on a biologically active pervious structure) captures a wide range of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, dyes, antibiotics, volatile organic compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The highly efficient and robust synergistic bacterial consortium immobilized on a biologically active pervious structure can bio-transform or biodegrade a wide range of parent and intermediate compounds sorbed on biochar, and bacterial exopolysaccharides. The biologically active pervious structure can be implemented for runoff treatment in individual buildings, urban communities, and coastal areas.

But do we really know how we make these decisions? This project proposes a new method for exploring decision makers? knowledge of how they make decisions ? which psychologists refer to as metacognitive knowledge. This method is specifically designed to assess decision makers? metacognitive knowledge when they are making subjective decisions in which they must make tradeoffs between different factors. The method is used to explore a range of questions about how people think about the decisions that they make. Developing and testing this method is important because it allows us to better understand how people make not only personal decisions, such as buying a car or house, but also policy-relevant decisions, such as which candidate to vote for or which policy to endorse. This knowledge can be useful in designing interventions and decision environments that help people make better decisions.<br/><br/>The project presents a novel paradigm for assessing metacognitive knowledge in subjective, multi-attribute choice decisions. In this paradigm, participants are asked to complete a Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) task, then self-report the influence (i.e., weight) they believe each attribute had on their decision-making process. These self-reported weights are compared to revealed weights estimated via Hierarchical Bayes Estimation from the CBC task, with higher correspondence indicating greater metacognitive knowledge. The proposed studies seek to validate the paradigm, implement the paradigm to isolate various metacognitive mechanisms (e.g., metacognitive control, metacognitive monitoring), and use the paradigm to explore the role that metacognitive knowledge may play in classic decision phenomena (e.g., framing effects). The primary contribution of this project is to expand the meta-reasoning (i.e., metacognition in reasoning) literature ? which has primarily focused on objective decisions ? into subjective decisions, which are highly important and often have significant impacts on individuals? well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microwave spectroscopy is a powerful method for determining the precise three-dimensional structure of a molecule or cluster of molecules, but spectra obtained from mixtures of unknown molecular species are extremely challenging to interpret because of their sheer complexity.  Dr. Park and his students will use automated microwave and infrared spectroscopy techniques to unravel the complicated patterns and learn about the structure and vibrational dynamics of the world?s tiniest drops of acid, consisting of a single acid molecule dissolved by a handful of water molecules. Their studies could provide crucial benchmarks for the theoretical description of aqueous clusters and could lead to significant advances in chemical structure determination from microwave spectra of mixtures. The Park group will develop a microwave spectrometer to provide hands-on instruction for undergraduate students and will perform community outreach with future-scientist middle school girls. <br/><br/>Technological advances in frequency-flexible broadband microwave spectroscopy enable entirely new approaches to microwave structure determination in complex mixtures. The current capabilities of automated assignment algorithms will be extended to more complex, non-rigid Hamiltonians. The primary target of this investigation will be hydrohalic acid-water clusters with a single HX molecule and 3-10 water molecules. To date, existing spectroscopic approaches have only enabled microwave structures and unambiguous, undisputed IR assignment of very small clusters with fewer than three water molecules. A key goal of this investigation will be to obtain high-resolution measurements of the structure and vibrational dynamics of the smallest clusters that lead to dissociation. The isotopic substitution of the clusters will be varied in a controlled way, facilitating the assignment of a complete set of substitution structures, which will allow the determination of the microwave structure. Isomer-resolved IR spectra of neutral clusters will be obtained by IR-microwave double resonance.

Nonlinear optical spectroscopy, which is widely used to explore light-matter interactions, requires high light intensities due to fundamental limitations in classical optical detection. Unfortunately, this often introduces significant ambiguity in the derived photophysical models. This research project seeks to overcome this limitation by harnessing the superior signal-to-noise ratio provided by quantum-optical methods. Dr. Srimath Kandada and his students will use this enhanced experimental capability to investigate the unique exciton physics of two-dimensional derivatives of metal halide perovskites. Improved comprehension of perovskite photophysics is expected to drive the optimization of their optoelectronic properties, with potential benefits for a variety of applications.

The first part of the project will focus on the nature of polaronic coupling of photo-excitations in two-dimensional metal halides and the role of dynamic lattice fluctuations. The experiment involves the measurement of noise in the amplitude and phase of the transient optical response in the presence of an impulsively generated population of coherent phonons.

To prevent an impending collapse, we must recognize the early warning signs. This is particularly challenging in ecological systems due to their naturally complex behavior in both space and time, as well as noisy and/or poorly resolved data. In this project, the investigators will use a novel approach for early detection of impending population collapse, and apply the methodology to spatially distributed populations, for example, a grassland. They utilize a method called computational topology, which can quantify features of a population distribution pattern, such as the level of patchiness in the pattern. In previous work, the investigators used a spatial population model to quantify the changes in a population distribution pattern that occurred as the population went extinct and observed a ""topological route to extinction"". In this project, the investigators will develop and extend the methodology for use in stochastic population models and real-world data sets, which are expected to contain high levels of noise and/or missing/corrupted data. The developed methodology will serve as an additional tool for the prediction of impending population collapse. This tool can then be used by conservation biologists and natural resource managers in order to assist in preserving vulnerable species and ecosystems. The project also supports undergraduate research, and includes recruitment efforts directed at students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>In previous work on data generated by a deterministic population model, the investigators measured changes in topological features (via cubical homology) of population distribution patterns en route to extinction, and observed clear topological signatures of impending collapse. Results with the deterministic model serve as a proof of concept, but in this project, the investigators will study dynamical changes in stochastic population models and real ecological data sets. Transitioning from deterministic to stochastic systems will require substantial development of the methodology, and will require the use of more sophisticated tools, e.g., multiparameter persistent homology. The developed methodology must be able to detect signal in noisy data, corrupted data, missing data, and data that is sparse in space and/or time. Because the topological approach can distinguish fine-scale stochastic noise from large-scale deterministic spatial patterns, it is a promising tool for the analysis of noisy ecological data, and preliminary work using multiparameter persistence shows that it is capable of recovering ""true? dynamical signal (a population distribution pattern) from noise.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Population and Community Ecology Cluster (PEC) of the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI tools like ChatGPT have been adapted to several industries, from real estate to journalism, and related AI technologies are predicted to have a profound impact on nearly every industry. This unprecedented adoption brings a myriad of concerns, including the impact of using AI tools to replace and thus devalue human interactions. This project will explore how AI text generation tools like ChatGPT portray stress and mental health in engineering. By examining how engineering is portrayed and comparing results to previously recorded interviews, the project will identify how these AI tools can be leveraged for qualitative research studies. Understanding engineering cultural norms and expectations, particularly around stress and mental health, is critical in addressing longstanding challenges in engineering related to chronic underrepresentation of groups and low student retention. The project is a fit with the EAGER program due to its exploratory nature, as AI text generation tools have not been used for data generation, despite their increasing use in data analysis. Further, the project is potentially transformational with its potential to introduce new research methodologies. Finally, the project will provide training and resources to the larger engineering education community to use AI tools.<br/><br/>This project will explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate qualitative datasets. The project is exploratory in its goal to use LLMs as a research tool to understand engineering cultural norms related to stress and mental health and will be informed by the Engineering Culture framework. Results generated from LLMs will be compared with themes derived from qualitative datasets generated from student interviews about engineering culture. With the rapidly increasing availability of open source LLMs, researchers have, and will increasingly continue, to use LLMs and other AI tools for research. This has created a critical and urgent need to determine best practices to yield high quality data and analyses. To address this, our project asks the overall research question: How can LLMs be used to generate data for qualitative engineering education research studying engineering culture? The study will develop guidelines for how LLMs can be leveraged to produce quality datasets for cultural studies that enrich existing qualitative methods and overcome limitations of these methods. The project will specifically examine cultural understandings of mental health in engineering culture and compare LLM-generated datasets to student interviews about stress and mental health in engineering culture. Research to understand the knowledge distilled by LLMs will contribute to research on understanding perceived norms and assumptions about stress and mental health in engineering education and careers. Leveraging LLMs in qualitative research has the potential to enable new and synergistic methods for qualitative research. The project will develop resources for the engineering education research community to use AI in qualitative research. Ultimately, the proposed work will lay the groundwork to understand how LLMs can be best used in qualitative EER and engage engineering education researchers in the AI Revolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zeolites are a class of nanoporous solid-acid catalysts that are particularly well suited to reactions of hydrocarbons derived from natural gas and petroleum resources.  The transition from fossil-based resources to bio-renewable feedstocks in recent years has triggered interest in modifying zeolites and other microporous catalysts to increase their effectiveness for reacting raw biomass molecules to higher-value fuels and chemicals.  The project investigates a novel approach for modifying acid catalysts that involves promoting reaction rates through confinement in tight spaces while facilitating diffusion of bulky product molecules away from the active sites.  The approach utilizes a molecular imprinting atomic layer deposition method to create microporous silica structures near the active sites to induce confinement effects without imposing transport constraints. These solid acids catalysts with tunable porous structures will be tested for their effectiveness and stability in aromatic alkylation and aldol condensation reactions, chosen because of their widespread application in industrial chemistry and in upgrading biomass-derived molecules. The project will involve strong coupling between research and education by integrating the research results into classroom materials, providing research opportunities for students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM, showcasing the investigator?s laboratories to local K-12 female students, and creating and broadcasting educational videos via social media channels for researchers who are new to heterogeneous catalysis research.<br/><br/>Over the last two decades, the field has made significant progress in understanding the effects of reaction network, kinetics, and transport on observed rates, selectivities, and stabilities, on chemistries occurring on confined spaces such as microporous acidic zeolites. Yet, the three-dimensional network of microporous structures in zeolitic materials often introduces unwanted transport effects that can lead to undesired side reactions and catalyst deactivation caused by pore blockage. This project aims to add another dimension in rationally designing porous materials by developing and implementing molecular imprinting atomic layer deposition methods to create microporous SiO2 architecture near active sites in mesoporous aluminosilicates to induce confinement effects without imposing transport constraints. These solid acids with tunable porous structures will be used to assess their detailed role on observed rates, selectivities, and stabilities by combining kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods. In doing so, this proposal aims to provide comprehensive catalyst design principles for active site manipulation that match the specific requirements of C-C coupling chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they are widely used in heat transfer applications such as plastic heat exchangers, electronic cooling, and electric vehicle thermal management due to their mechanical flexibility and low cost. However, the development of thermally conductive amorphous polymers has been exceptionally challenging due to the lack of physical guidance. This project aims to combine molecular simulations, machine learning (ML), and experiments to develop amorphous polymers with high TC (>1.5 W/mK) and understand the underlying molecular features dictating thermal transport. The methodology developed and the physics understood from this project will significantly speed up and increase the success rate of developing high TC polymers. These new materials will contribute to tackling the challenges in many heat transfer applications. This project will also provide multi-disciplinary education opportunities to students and researchers from diverse backgrounds and scientific fields. The topics of this project will cultivate future workforce for the U.S. industry. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to significantly speed up the development of thermally conductive polymer and understand the underlying structure-property relationships governing amorphous polymer TC. To reach this goal, the objectives of this project are: (1) establish a standardized polymer database using high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by data from existing database (e.g., PolyInfo) and open literature; (2) employ a unique ML training technique, semi-supervised framework for graph imbalanced regression (SGIR), to develop accurate surrogate models that map out structure-property relations for polymer chemistry, structure and TC, and use our Graph Rationalization with Environment-based Augmentations (GREA) technique to identify the influential molecular features impacting TC; (3) use the established model to predict ~100 polymers with varying TC and perform detailed MD simulations to calculate the TC to verify the prediction and understand the ML-identified structure-property relationship; (4) down-select 10 polymers with the expert opinion from collaborating polymer chemists on the synthesizability of the predicted polymers, synthesize them and measure their TC. The data-driven approach to be established in this project will provide an impactful example in the field concerning thermally conductive polymers.

After the fusion, the gametic nuclei from both parents migrate towards each other and blend the genetic materials to initiate the next generation. While most organisms rely on microtubules for gamete nuclear migration, flowering plants have evolved a distinctive system that instead utilizes actin filaments (F-actin). This collaborative research project between the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding the orchestration of F-actin dynamics and sperm nuclear migration in Arabidopsis thaliana. The Broader Impacts of the project span scientific and educational outcomes. Agriculturally, understanding the mechanisms governing early fertilization events may help address the predicted future loss of crop plant fertility due to an increasingly unstable climate. To nurture STEM education, undergraduate students will participate in collaborative research experiences spanning experimental and computational biology. An annual plant biology workshop, featuring both molecular and computational approaches, will engage university and community college students in hands-on learning. The team will promote appreciation for plant science by participating in county science fairs and elementary school science nights, and an interactive visualization tool will be developed to enable participants to explore cell features and comprehend their consequences.<br/><br/>Most animals and early diverging land plants, such as ferns, control gamete nuclear migration by microtubules. However, flowering plants have evolved a novel system where sperm nuclear migration is instead controlled by F-actin. Prior to fertilization, female gametes generate constant movement of an F-actin meshwork from the plasma membrane towards the center of the cell, where the nucleus is located. Upon sperm nucleus release into the female gamete, the sperm nucleus migrates along with the F-actin meshwork for karyogamy. However, the mechanisms controlling F-actin dynamics and sperm nuclear migration in flowering plants remain largely unknown. This project combines real-time live-cell imaging and computational modeling to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling the movement of F-actin meshwork in the female gamete for sperm nuclear migration in the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will address critical scientific questions, including understanding the role of the ARP2/3-independent WAVE/SCAR pathway and unraveling the functions of class XI myosin through real-time live-cell imaging, which has been established by the team. Additionally, it aims to explore the biophysical mechanisms underlying F-actin motion via computer simulations, identify factors governing sperm nuclear migration in the egg cell, and uncover new contributors to F-actin movement using reverse genetics approaches. The interdisciplinary approach, encompassing plant biology, real-time live-cell imaging, and computational modeling, will reveal detailed molecular insights into plant fertilization. The outcomes will not only advance understanding of fundamental biological processes but also contribute insights into the evolution of sperm nuclear migration mechanisms in land plants.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosociences along with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extensive studies have revealed that protrusions contain multiple actin networks with different structures.  However, understanding each network?s role in probing and forward movement has been limited.  The networks cannot be isolated without inducing compensatory effects, and they cannot probe or bind ECM without receptors. Yet, the networks are not thought to connect to receptors until the receptors bind to ECM. This proposal targets these significant gaps by considering actin networks and ECM receptors as complex systems, an assembly of parts that produces more functionality than its components.  However, as many of us learned as children who took something apart to figure out how it worked and ended up with a box of parts that could not be put back together, some hidden randomness, hierarchy, or collective dynamic essential for functionality disappears when pieces are removed.  This project will study ECM-guided cell migration as a complex system composed of non-separable, hierarchical, interactive, dynamic ECM receptor?actin network subsystems that regulate probing and forward migration.  Using nanofabricated ECM substrates will identify the subsystems and determine how they respond to substrate cues at the cellular, sub-cellular, and single-molecule levels.  Challenging the cells to engage multiple subsystems to navigate complex challenges using ECM mazes will define the subsystem hierarchy of action for each choice and enable the use of graph theory to model cells navigating these complex challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since spheres are the fundamental building blocks of topological spaces, the stable stems, which encode the possible relations between high-dimensional spheres up to continuous deformation, are a central object of study. Beyond topology, the stable stems have surprisingly broad applications throughout mathematics, ranging from geometric problems, such as classifying differentiable structures on spheres, to algebraic problems, such as classifying projective modules over rings. This project will explore further applications of stable homotopy theory in algebra, topology, and geometry. Broader impacts center on online community building. The PI will continue co-organizing the Electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Online Research Community, which aims to increase inclusion at the undergraduate, graduate, and senior levels by organizing undergraduate research opportunities, graduate courses, online seminars, mini-courses, and networking events. To address inequality at the K-12 level, the PI will develop and manage a program pairing undergraduates from his home institution with students from local after-school programs for online tutoring. This program would circumvent certain barriers to participation, such as lack of access to transportation and facilities, which are common in traditional outreach.<br/><br/>Specific research projects include the study of the stable stems and their applications in geometric topology, algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems and their connections to number theory, and equivariant analogues of algebraic K-theory and their applications in algebra and geometry. More specifically, building on previous work, the PI will study the stable stems using topological modular forms and the Mahowald invariant, aiming to deduce the existence of exotic spheres in new dimensions. In a related direction, the PI will use the kq-resolution introduced in previous work to study the motivic stable stems, an algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems. The main goal is to apply the kq-resolution to relate the motivic stable stems to arithmetic invariants like Hermitian K-theory. Real algebraic K-theory, which encodes classical invariants like algebraic K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, and L-theory, will also be studied using the trace methods developed in previous work. The overarching goal is extending results from algebraic K-theory to real algebraic K-theory, thereby obtaining results for Hermitian K-theory and L-theory that will have applications in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thanks to close interactions with collaborators in data science and information technology, the investigator will ensure the practicability of the proposed research, leading to a real impact. The investigator will also devote herself to various outreach activities in the field of data science.

The research focuses on signal/image recovery from a limited number of measurements, in which ""limited"" refers to the fact that the amount of data that can be taken or transmitted is limited by technical or economic constraints. When data is insufficient, one often requires additional information from the application domain to build a mathematical model, followed by numerical methods. Questions to be explored in this project include: (1) how difficult is the process of extracting insights from data? (2) how should reasonable assumptions be taken into account to build a mathematical model? (3) how should an efficient algorithm be designed to find a model solution? More importantly, a feedback loop from insights to data will be introduced, i.e., (4) how to improve upon data acquisition so that information becomes easier to retrieve? As these questions mimic the standard procedure in mathematical modeling, the proposed research provides a plethora of illustrative examples to enrich the education of mathematical modeling.

After the fusion, the gametic nuclei from both parents migrate towards each other and blend the genetic materials to initiate the next generation. While most organisms rely on microtubules for gamete nuclear migration, flowering plants have evolved a distinctive system that instead utilizes actin filaments (F-actin). This collaborative research project between the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding the orchestration of F-actin dynamics and sperm nuclear migration in Arabidopsis thaliana. The Broader Impacts of the project span scientific and educational outcomes. Agriculturally, understanding the mechanisms governing early fertilization events may help address the predicted future loss of crop plant fertility due to an increasingly unstable climate. To nurture STEM education, undergraduate students will participate in collaborative research experiences spanning experimental and computational biology. An annual plant biology workshop, featuring both molecular and computational approaches, will engage university and community college students in hands-on learning. The team will promote appreciation for plant science by participating in county science fairs and elementary school science nights, and an interactive visualization tool will be developed to enable participants to explore cell features and comprehend their consequences.<br/><br/>Most animals and early diverging land plants, such as ferns, control gamete nuclear migration by microtubules. However, flowering plants have evolved a novel system where sperm nuclear migration is instead controlled by F-actin. Prior to fertilization, female gametes generate constant movement of an F-actin meshwork from the plasma membrane towards the center of the cell, where the nucleus is located. Upon sperm nucleus release into the female gamete, the sperm nucleus migrates along with the F-actin meshwork for karyogamy. However, the mechanisms controlling F-actin dynamics and sperm nuclear migration in flowering plants remain largely unknown. This project combines real-time live-cell imaging and computational modeling to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling the movement of F-actin meshwork in the female gamete for sperm nuclear migration in the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will address critical scientific questions, including understanding the role of the ARP2/3-independent WAVE/SCAR pathway and unraveling the functions of class XI myosin through real-time live-cell imaging, which has been established by the team. Additionally, it aims to explore the biophysical mechanisms underlying F-actin motion via computer simulations, identify factors governing sperm nuclear migration in the egg cell, and uncover new contributors to F-actin movement using reverse genetics approaches. The interdisciplinary approach, encompassing plant biology, real-time live-cell imaging, and computational modeling, will reveal detailed molecular insights into plant fertilization. The outcomes will not only advance understanding of fundamental biological processes but also contribute insights into the evolution of sperm nuclear migration mechanisms in land plants.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosociences along with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In cancer research, for example, it is crucial to model whether a patient has cancer of subtype A, B, or C and high or low mortality risk given the expression of thousands of genes. However, existing statistical methods either cannot be applied, fail to capture the complex relationships between the response variables, or lead to models that are difficult to interpret and thus, yield little scientific insight. The PIs address this deficiency by developing multiple new statistical methods. For each new method, the PIs will provide theoretical justifications and fast computational algorithms. Along with graduate and undergraduate students, the PIs will also create publicly available software that will enable applications across both academia and industry.<br/><br/>This project aims to address a fundamental problem in multivariate categorical data analysis: how to parsimoniously model the joint probability mass function of many categorical random variables given a common set of high-dimensional predictors. The PIs will tackle this problem by using emerging technologies on tensor decompositions, dimension reduction, and both convex and non-convex optimization. The project focuses on three research directions: (1) a latent variable approach for the low-rank decomposition of a conditional probability tensor; (2) a new overlapping convex penalty for intrinsic dimension reduction in a multivariate generalized linear regression framework; and (3) a direct non-convex optimization-based approach for low-rank tensor regression utilizing explicit rank constraints on the Tucker tensor decomposition. Unlike the approach of regressing each (univariate) categorical response on the predictors separately, the new models and methods will allow practitioners to characterize the complex and often interesting dependencies between the responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, some structures on the fire path remained unscathed. Current models designed for wildfire spread in wildland-urban-interface (WUI) communities predominantly function at community or larger scales. They fall short in capturing the observations from the Lahaina wildfires, such as specific buildings remaining undamaged amidst extensively destroyed structures. Notably, there exists a group of tools that, in principle, have the capability to simulate fire spread on and between individual structures with high fidelity Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-based (CFD-based) fire models, e.g., the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) developed by NIST and FireFoam developed by FM Global. These tools can potentially be used to both analyze and predict fire spread inside WUI communities and provide deep insights into the resilience of particular structures. However, to date, their application to model fire spread on and between structures in a wildfire has been limited primarily due to the lack of data necessary to correctly set up and validate these high-fidelity models. This project aims to overcome these challenges, enabling more accurate modeling of structure burning and fire spread in WUI settings in the future. This project will also help in training a new generation of researchers in wildfire and WUI fire resilience. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enhance the WUI fire assessment through compiling a comprehensive dataset that accurately documents how the wildfire spread and impacted the community of Lahaina. It will also assess the feasibility of using high-fidelity CFD-based models to simulate the burning of individual structures in a WUI fire scenario. The comprehensive dataset, pulling from diverse data sources and formats, will be systematically organized, offering a wealth of detailed information in an easily understandable manner. This dataset is crucial for refining WUI fire spread models across all scales, from community-wide fire spread to individual structure response. After the dataset is compiled, high-fidelity CFD models will be set up for two Lahaina structures, one damaged by fire and one undamaged despite being in the path of fire. The aim is to determine if these models can accurately simulate the damage that was observed. By doing so, the project can identify areas where our current understanding and modeling approaches may be lacking or incomplete, guiding the future development of modeling techniques. The dataset and the model feasibility study ultimately will enhance WUI fire risk assessment, driving more informed decision-making in wildfire mitigation strategies. Additionally, both the dataset and the model feasibility study are valuable for broader WUI fire research and practice, including the performance-based design of structures against wildfires using high-fidelity CFD-based models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their tiny size and unique properties, nanoparticles have unique advantages as devices that can both sense and stimulate nerve cells (neurons). These unique properties can also be harnessed to develop new technologies that will help us in understanding how the brain works and in overcoming brain-related conditions such as Parkinson?s disease and epilepsy. Furthermore, nanomaterials are increasingly becoming common in everyday life. Although our body's defense system filters out many foreign substances, studies indicate that nanoparticles can still enter the central nervous system through various pathways.  How these tiny particles interact with nerve cells is not well understood; this is a big obstacle to using them widely for recording and stimulating neurons and assessing their impact on the central nervous system. This project has two main goals: (1) to understand how and why certain nanoparticles naturally bind to neurons as they grow and mature; and (2) to determine how this binding affects the electrical properties and activity of neurons. Understanding these interactions could lead to better-designed nanoparticles for studying the brain and new, less invasive technologies for treating nerve-related disorders. This project is an important step in filling in our knowledge gaps and could have a big impact on society by helping us deal with serious nerve-related conditions.  The PIs will continue their ongoing successful recruitment and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and will develop a Nano-Neuro Summer School program aimed at middle school students, targeting those from groups underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/><br/>Owing to their optimal dimensions and unique biophysicochemical properties, nanoparticles offer distinct advantages as neural sensors and stimulators. However, the lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of nano-neuro interactions remains a critical bottleneck in the widespread use of functional nanostructures for recording and stimulating neurons.

To achieve these goals, the PIs will: (1) investigate the effect of the magnitude of the nanoparticle charge on the maturation-dependent binding of nanoparticles to neurons; (2) explore the effect of the electrophysiological properties and electrical activity of neurons on nanoparticle binding; and (3) elucidate the effect of nanoparticle binding on the excitability of neurons. Successful completion of this project will advance scientific understanding of the nano-neuro interactions and can have a transformative impact on the design and synthesis of nanomaterials for neuroscience and minimally-invasive technologies for treating neuronal disorders.

A hallmark feature of these structures is their ability to support large loads despite their thin architecture. One such shell structure, responsible for guarding the genome inside our cells, is the nuclear envelope (i.e., the boundary of the nucleus). This structure has a unique geometry comprised of two concentric hollow spherical shells fused at thousands of sites with torus-shaped holes, and exhibits one order of magnitude amplification in flexural stiffness. Inspired by this finding, this study investigates a new class of optimal biomimetic shell structures, termed torenes, comprising concentric shell layers fused with torus-shaped holes. The torene architecture could enable new designs in aircrafts, submarines, and rockets to achieve high resilience in countering extreme natural forces. The discovered principles can guide the design of lightweight prosthetics, and protective gear for defense personnel and athletes to counter high impact loads. The research findings will be disseminated by hands-on pedagogical demonstrations, scientoons (science-based cartoons), virtual mechanics labs, journal publications and guest lectures for high school students.   <br/><br/>Poised at the interface of mechanics, geometry, and optimization, the research will investigate the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of plate and shell structures with ultra-high genus. The study will perform finite element analyses to investigate force-deformation response and stability of torene structures under in-plane and out-of-plane loadings. This information will be used to construct proper objective functions and constraints to perform topology optimization of multilayer plates and shells. In particular, numerical optimization will be used to identify topologies that maximize performance of torene structures under different external loads and functional requirements. The study will apply the discovered geometric principles to design and experimentally test 3D torene architectures derived from 2D materials for achieving ultra-flexural stiffness.

A hallmark feature of these structures is their ability to support large loads despite their thin architecture. One such shell structure, responsible for guarding the genome inside our cells, is the nuclear envelope (i.e., the boundary of the nucleus). This structure has a unique geometry comprised of two concentric hollow spherical shells fused at thousands of sites with torus-shaped holes, and exhibits one order of magnitude amplification in flexural stiffness. Inspired by this finding, this study investigates a new class of optimal biomimetic shell structures, termed torenes, comprising concentric shell layers fused with torus-shaped holes. The torene architecture could enable new designs in aircrafts, submarines, and rockets to achieve high resilience in countering extreme natural forces. The discovered principles can guide the design of lightweight prosthetics, and protective gear for defense personnel and athletes to counter high impact loads. The research findings will be disseminated by hands-on pedagogical demonstrations, scientoons (science-based cartoons), virtual mechanics labs, journal publications and guest lectures for high school students.  <br/><br/>Poised at the interface of mechanics, geometry, and optimization, the research will investigate the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of plate and shell structures with ultra-high genus. The study will perform finite element analyses to investigate force-deformation response and stability of torene structures under in-plane and out-of-plane loadings. This information will be used to construct proper objective functions and constraints to perform topology optimization of multilayer plates and shells. In particular, numerical optimization will be used to identify topologies that maximize performance of torene structures under different external loads and functional requirements. The study will apply the discovered geometric principles to design and experimentally test 3D torene architectures derived from 2D materials for achieving ultra-flexural stiffness.

The speed and success of this technology shift (?decarbonization?) depend in part upon whether it is perceived to be implemented equitably with benefits that accrue broadly across society. A major way that energy generation intersects with equity is through ambient air pollution. Ambient air pollution is one of the largest causes of death in the US and globally, with health burdens that are distributed inequitably on both regional and international scales. However, minimal research has thus far been conducted into the air quality and environmental justice implications of different decarbonization strategies. Furthermore, current integrated assessment models, which are used to develop decarbonization strategies, have minimal support for air quality assessment and are not well-suited to quantify environmental inequity. This project will develop a new modeling framework for integrated assessment of climate, air quality, and environmental equity impacts of policy scenarios, and apply the framework in the analysis and evaluation of climate policy. The research targets greatly improved understanding of the co-benefits and dis-benefits of decarbonization policy scenarios, especially as related to environmental equity, both within the US and internationally. It also targets improved understanding of effective methods for educating the general public on climate science and policy. The open-source computational tools to be created aim to facilitate the calculation of air quality co-benefits and related equity by policymakers, sustainability scientists, and others. This goal is to result in a stronger technical grounding for decarbonization policy. Furthermore, as the perception of equity is critical to successful decarbonization, the identification of strategies that mitigate environmental injustice, and the development of educational tools to broadly communicate the benefits of those policies, will contribute to the fight against climate change overall. <br/><br/>Project research will be organized in three Thrusts. Thrust 1 will couple the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) with the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP). GCAM represents linkages between energy, water, land, climate and economic systems. InMAP is a high-resolution, reduced-complexity model of the transport, transformation, and removal of air pollution developed by PI Tessum and widely used to estimate air pollution health and equity impacts of policy interventions. Both GCAM and InMAP have versions that are global- and US-focused and the research will couple the corresponding versions to allow analysis at sub-national US and international scales. Thrust 2 will expand the coupled models developed in Thrust 1 to allow high-resolution integrated assessment. To do this, the research will integrate high-resolution demographic population down-scaling into the resulting model to allow the assessment of how policy scenarios will differentially affect air pollution exposure across different demographic groups. Technology implementation decisions will also be enabled at high spatial resolution within the model, enabling the exploration of intra-urban location-based policy implementation. Thrust 3 will create a machine-learned single-pass GCAM solver that allows the model to run in seconds instead of hours for a subset of possible scenarios, as well as flexible software infrastructure (GCAM-EDU) for building interactive educational experiences.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is jointly supported by the NSF ENG/CBET Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Engineering program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing buildings are responsible for one-third of U.S. carbon emissions and reducing or eliminating these emissions is critical for meeting national climate goals. However, if not fully understood and carefully managed, the climate benefits of decarbonization could come at the expense of energy affordability, increasing the already high energy burden felt in many low-income communities. Predictive building energy modeling tools (i.e., models as scientific data) and game-based learning methods (i.e., models as play) offer opportunities for examining what-if scenarios at the intersection of building decarbonization and equity, but need to be transformed to this aim. To meet this need, the goal of this CAREER research is to investigate the environmental and equity impacts of building decarbonization retrofits using a novel predictive modeling framework. The education goal is to increase public energy literacy through game-based learning. The outcomes of this research will help accelerate building decarbonization while balancing its benefits and costs across the population. The education activities will improve energy and carbon literacy among a diverse population of youth and young adults.<br/><br/>This research has three specific objectives: (R1) Quantify the benefits and burdens of building decarbonization retrofits by climate and grid region using a novel equity-focused energy modeling approach; (R2) Analyze the interactions between decarbonization retrofits and underlying patterns of energy inequity at the urban scale using urban building energy modeling; and (R3) Determine the benefits and burdens of building decarbonization retrofits under future climate and grid scenarios. This research will advance fundamental understanding of building decarbonization and its impacts on underlying patterns of inequity in the built environment, as well as our capacity to model these impacts. The education activities will design, pilot, and evaluate two games for youth and young adults: (E1) Urban building decarbonization game for middle and high school students and teachers; and (E2) Energy burden simulation for undergraduate students.

Integrated management of C, N, and P to ensure climate-smart crop production while preserving clean waters is hindered by several knowledge and technology gaps. To approach a solution for this grand challenge, this project aims to significantly advance the holistic understanding and modeling of the interconnected C, N, P, and water cycles in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. This goal will be pursued by developing an AI-based framework of integrated nutrient, streamflow, and parcel simulation for resilient agroecosystems (INSPIRE) that can easily ingest multi-source observations and provide an accurate and speedy quantification from the field to basin scale. The outcomes from this project are expected to provide valuable insights for policymakers and farming communities, particularly in optimizing management practices for improved carbon sequestration, soil health, and water quality in the America's heartland. Additionally, this project intertwines its research objectives with an educational agenda, which is featured by developing a computational tool to foster broad participations in large-scale computing among undergraduates. The project will also introduce a cyber-physical watershed mesocosm as an innovative trial of using the digital twin technology to enhance STEM education related to agricultural and environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This project will develop under the overarching hypothesis that AI-assisted integrated simulation of C, N, P, and water fluxes, compared with existing process-based modeling approach, is better able to capture high resolution environmental variability and identify best practices for achieving climate-smart agriculture and water quality goals without sacrificing crop production. The scientific innovations will be achieved through four objectives. First, a Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML)-based INSPIRE-Field model will be developed to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of field-level C, N, P, and hydrological interactions. Second, INSPIRE-Field will be coupled with Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based hydrologic surrogate models that first aggregate field water and nutrient fluxes within small watersheds (i.e., INSPIRE-Watershed), and then routing watershed outputs throughout the Upper Mississippi River Basin (i.e., INSPIRE-Basin). To reduce the uncertainty of INSPIRE, a novel representation learning method to efficiently assimilate remote and in-situ sensing data via low-dimensional embeddings will be explored. Third, a user-friendly web interface will be developed that allows stakeholders to preview outcomes of different climate- smart management practices and identify field-specific preferred management strategies based on multiobjective optimizations for C, N, P, and hydrological goals. Finally, the education and practice of computing, sensing, and machine learning among the future workforce of agroecosystem engineers, educators, and decision-makers will be enhanced through project activities. The investigator aims to lead the frontier of data analytics for sustainable agriculture by integrating remote sensing, mechanistic modeling, and artificial intelligence, with the aspiration to enable monitoring and managing every cropland, track pollutants, forecast agricultural risks, provide farmers best solutions to minimize negative environmental impacts, and ultimately help the world to achieve a sustainable food future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Following a similar trend, the downscaling of photonic devices promises highly efficient photonic ICs. A crucial component in high-performance photonic ICs is an on-chip laser. Such a laser must simultaneously have high efficiency, low energy consumption, robust operation, and a small footprint to be compatible with the rest of the photonic circuitry and even electronic ICs. However, existing on-chip lasers, and photonic devices in general, are sensitive to structural imperfections, which become more prominent as the device becomes smaller. The proposed program will theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate compact on-chip III-V lasers that are robust, efficient, and whose single-mode operation range can be tailored. The superior performance of these lasers stems from the fact that the emission is protected by the bulk topology of the cavity. The devices developed in this program will lead to a family of topologically protected lasers that satisfies several requirements of the next-generation lasers for photonic ICs, which will advance electronic-photonic integration, as well as applications such as data communication, signal processing, sensing, and quantum photonics. The educational portion of the program aims to increase public awareness of photonics, pipeline qualified students to help advance the U.S. photonics industry and expand the American workforce in photonics.<br/><br/>Robust and efficient on-chip light generation and transport are at the heart of modern chip-scale optical communication and information processing technologies, leading to the search for the next generation of on-chip lasers. In this collaborative research, miniature on-chip lasers that overcome fundamental challenges in miniature lasers ? the simultaneous achievement of robust operation and a small footprint ? will be realized. These lasers feature 1) robust operation: the laser emission is protected by the topology of the bulk rather than the emitting site itself; 2) small footprint: the laser is realized in 1D rather than the typical 2D; 3) large and tailorable single-mode lasing range, and 4) compatibility with existing photonic IC technologies: a synthetic rather than an actual magnetic field is used to support the non-trivial bulk topology.<br/>The success of this research will determine a suitable light source candidate for densely packed photonic ICs, and lead to not only fully functional photonic ICs but also the connectivity between the photonic ?plane? and electronic ?plane? in multi-functional adaptive photonic/electronic integrated systems. From the fundamental perspective, the topologically protected lasers developed in this project not only can be used to probe the multi-dimensional topological phase diagram of non-Hermitian systems but will also allow the exploration of other exotic phases of topological photonic devices beyond photonic topological insulators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ability is critically important in order to learn and interact socially with others. In particular, visual attention to social stimuli (i.e., social attention) plays a vital role in guiding social behaviors. Impaired social attention underlies many psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as autism and ADHD. However, very little is known about human visual attention at the single-neuron level. The goal of this CAREER project is to understand the underlying neural processes involved in human social attention using technology that provides the highest degree of spatial resolution (location of brain activity) and temporal resolution (timing of brain activity) currently available. The investigators will collaborate with neurosurgeons and record directly from neurons in the human brain, as patients undergo treatment of epilepsy. These neurons reside in brain regions involved in attention, decision making, or processing of socially relevant images. The research will elucidate how single neurons, within specific brain regions, contribute to visual attention. Results will provide novel insight into how these processes differ in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This study will contribute to teaching materials and outreach to clinical communities. The data acquired and analysis tools developed will be made freely available to other researchers in order to advance science in the field of cognitive neuroscience research and human neural recordings.<br/><br/>The research team will investigate the neural circuits of social attention in humans for both goal-driven attention (Aim 1) and stimulus-driven attention (Aim 2).

Together, with the unique human single-neuron recordings, the research will address important fundamental neuroscience questions by providing comprehensive analysis of the neural circuits underlying social attention in humans. The outcomes of this research are important to understand the neural mechanisms of impaired visual attention in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders and will be informative for development of future targeted intervention strategies.

This project aims to deepen understanding of these mathematical structures. The first part of the research concentrates on the study of three-manifolds obtained from links via the so-called ""Dehn surgery"" operation and the family of links appearing in algebraic geometry.

Much work has been devoted to understanding how to express the efficiency of the process in terms of local turbulent parameters. Recent work though suggests that the physics of stratified mixing cannot be abstracted from the larger context in which it occurs. In this project, laboratory experiments will be conducted in a tank large enough, and suitably forced, that it may approximate more faithfully the conditions observed in the ocean, a Minimal Ocean Mixing System (MOMS). The laboratory measurements will provide a way to test theoretical and practical ways to represent mixing in computer models. Stratified turbulent mixing in a similar environment is also present in the atmosphere, and this research will therefore have a spill-over effect in atmospheric sciences. The present measurements and numerical simulations will also constitute a new dataset which can be used as a training set for Artificial Intelligence algorithms reduced order models and data-assimilation techniques which require a substantial knowledge of the flow for their validation. Finally, reducing uncertainties of irreversible mixing using the present research will improve the predictive power of general circulation models at climate scales. The PI will make every effort to advertise the postdoc position broadly so to reach candidates that traditionally have been marginalized. The PI will also work with the local chapter of SCIREN, an organization that connects STEM researchers with local teachers to improve the quality and scientific literacy of youths.<br/><br/><br/>It is clear that the recent work surveyed shows a shift in the focus from a purely local characterization of stratified mixing (e.g., the quest for parameterizations of mixing efficiency based on the buoyancy Reynolds number) to a view that sees mixing as the end product of a dynamic that starts at much larger scales and is (potentially) much more intertwined than previously recognized. Experimentally, this requires rethinking the problem of stratified mixing to include a more natural way to force the problem, and a domain sufficiently large to accommodate both the anisotropic and the isotropic part of the spectrum, a MOMS. The dataset collected in these experiments and numerical simulations will therefore, constitute a novel way to test and validate theoretical arguments to model the energy exchanges in stratified turbulent flows across the anisotropic / isotropic divide. In addition, this research aims to provide a link between vertically/horizontally towed instruments and planar / volume-resolved measurements. This project also intends to establish a link between near-ocean conditions combining theoretical with technical challenges at unprecedented scales for which the UNC Joint Fluids lab is designed. In addition, the Craya-Herring framework combined with the structure functions methods will provide the state-of-the-art theoretical foundations to analyze the role of the turbulence where intermittency remains a key open question to analyze and interpret field measurements, since mixing events are rarely observed nor statically converged in field measurements of strongly stratified turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this, the project team will develop novel methods of simulating users' behavior based on large-scale historical datasets.  These methods will be used to better understand vulnerabilities that underlying biases in training datasets pose to commonly-used machine learning-based methods for building and testing recommender systems, as well as characterize the effectiveness of common evaluation metrics such as recommendation accuracy and diversity given different models of how people interact with recommender systems in practice.  The team will publicly release its datasets, software, and novel metrics for the benefit of other researchers and developers of recommender systems.

The first will quantify and mitigate the popularity bias and misclassified decoy problems in offline recommender evaluation that tend to lead to popular, known recommendations.  To do this, the team will develop simulation-based evaluation models that encode a variety of assumptions about how users select relevant items to buy and rate and use them to quantify the statistical biases these assumptions induce in recommendation quality metrics. They will calibrate these simulations by comparing with existing data sets covering books, research papers, music, and movies.  These models and datasets will help drive the second main project around measuring the impact of feature distributions in training data on recommender algorithm accuracy and diversity, while developing bias-resistant algorithms.  The team will use data resampling techniques along with the simulation models, extended to model system behavior over time, to evaluate how different algorithms mitigate, propagate, or exacerbate underlying distributional biases through their recommendations, and how those biased recommendations in turn affect future user behavior and experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Negative evaluation is defined as a sense of dread associated with being unfavorably evaluated while participating in a social situation. Increasingly, college biology courses are transitioning from traditional lecture-based learning to active learning. In active learning classrooms, students engage in activities and discussions in class. However, students? fear of negative evaluation can negatively impact their learning in active learning courses. This project will develop a brief, self-guided online intervention designed to help undergraduate students productively cope with fear of negative evaluation within the context of active learning biology courses. Equipping students with skills to cope with fear of negative evaluation via this free online intervention has potential to change who is participating in active learning classrooms and whose voices are heard in science. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by studying its impact on student fear of negative evaluation, performance, and persistence in college biology. Project outcomes are intended to enhance students? experiences and performance in active learning biology courses.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a brief online Single-Session Intervention (SSI) to help undergraduates cope with fear of negative evaluation in the context of social evaluative situations encountered in active learning biology courses.  The self-guided SSI developed in this project will be a brief (< 30 minute) online activity comprised of evidence-based program components drawn from research in clinical, social, and educational psychology. The SSI will be designed for both scalability and accessibility. It will be easy to administer, independent of the instructor, freely available, and delivered to students at scale. To assess the impact of the SSI, the research team will conduct a large, randomized controlled trial across multiple introductory biology courses at one large diverse and non-selective institution.  The randomized controlled trail will assess the impact of the SSI on (1) student fear of negative evaluation and other affective outcomes, (2) student performance outcomes, and (3) student persistence outcomes.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

The handy properties of convexity and smoothness have become the norm of the field traditionally, and the most challenging features of the optimization models, nonconvexity and nondifferentiability, are abandoned and ignored.

The crux of the approach is a novel lifting technique that exposes an implicitly convex-concave structure of the complex value function.

Semiconductor technology increasingly faces fundamental physical limits. New approaches to hardware/software co-design are now achieving higher performance at extreme scales. This project will explore two new approaches: configurability and integration. Configurability enables hardware to map better to applications. Integration enables system components that have generally been single function to gain additional functionality. An example is a network for the transport of data. Such a network might also operate on that data as it is being transported. Integration enables compute everywhere in the architecture and network. Configurability and integration will lead to much more efficient use of computing resources. Such resources include high-performance computers. Another focus of this project will be in the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are a widely used type of integrated circuit. In FPGAs the hardware can be configured to match the application. FPGAs will allow the deployment of the research products into production systems. They will also allow evaluation of changes in system design. This work will advance extreme-scale computing applications. Such applications include medicine and new drug discovery. This project will also include training of graduate and undergraduate students. It will focus on students belonging to groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines<br/><br/>The central theme of this project is that emerging centrality of hardware configurability and integration means that at least two old systems abstractions must be broken. First, this project will demonstrate that computation and communication should no longer comprise separate silos. Second, it will demonstrate that applications should no longer be mapped to fixed hardware. In their place, new hardware-software abstractions must necessarily be built around the idea of the application-centric system. This project will identify new computing modes -- computation distribution/offload and configurable hardware -- that will be application aware with tight mapping of applications to computer systems. This improved mapping, in turn, will require deploying a number of mechanisms, starting with improved compilers and high-quality application libraries but extending to lighter-weight yet intelligent middleware (for instance, improved Message Passing Interface middleware), automated application modification, dynamic autotuning, and machine learning assisting in all of these components.   The project will consider all of these concerns in due course.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern compute clusters typically use specialized accelerator hardware to speed up computations. Operators of accelerator-rich clusters aim to have high resource utilization across all users of the cluster. However, these systems are often under-utilized due to performance variability across accelerators; that is, application performance varies across accelerators even when the same application is run on the same type of accelerator. This proposal will develop Fortuna, a set of tools that can be used by cluster operators and researchers to characterize and harness variability across accelerators. First, Fortuna will use new methodologies to characterize how much performance variability exists across a wide range of accelerator hardware.

These beetles are unique in that they also harbor fungi that act as their food source which grows on the tree tissues. Some of these fungi can then infect the tree and in several cases can result in the death of host trees within months of infection. These beetles and their pathogenic fungi occur worldwide and pose a significant threat to forestry and natural ecosystems. However, no genetic models for the study of any ambrosia beetle-fungal partner pairings are available. This proposal will use the Xyloborus beetle-laurel wilt pathogenic fungus (Harringtonia lauricola) as a model. Both the original beetle and the fungus are invasive to the United States and are rapidly spreading throughout the Southeastern part of the country. The beetle carries the fungus to trees, where the fungus is capable of killing otherwise healthy trees. There are over 500 different species of trees that the beetle uses as a host including swampbay, redbay, sassafras, and the agriculturally important crop of avocado, where the only treatment is to cut and burn the trees. In this project, we will study the dynamics and genetics of how the beetle harbors its fungal partner, including how the beetle chooses, promotes the growth of, and carries the fungus from host tree to host tree. These data can provide foundational information that can ultimately be used to help stop the spread of these tree pathogens. In addition, the project will provide opportunities for training and outreach to high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students on fungal biology, disease, symbioses and evolutionary processes. In partnership with programs at University of Florida, the investigator will develop educational material for the high school teachers and the general public on fungal-insect symbioses.  <br/><br/>Insect-fungal mutualisms are widespread in nature and ambrosia beetle-fungal interactions represent some of the oldest and most successful symbioses known. The fungus serves as the sole source of nutrition for the beetles that burrow into trees to form galleries where they grow and ?farm? the fungus for food. These beetles have evolved specialized structures (mycangia) that house, transport and disseminate the fungus. These fungi and beetles have co-adapted to symbiotic lifestyles throughout evolutionary history and include independent evolutions of different types of mycangia that house different fungal symbionts. The fungus, Harringtonia lauricola is a highly destructive tree pathogen affecting avocado and other members of the Lauraceae family and has killed >300 million trees in the US alone. H. lauricola is the mutualistic partner to its original invasive (to the US) beetle carrier (Xyleborus glabratus) and may have now spread to indigenous beetle species. We will investigate the developmental and genetic mechanisms which underlie the relationship between H. lauricola and Xyleborus beetles. The project will use cellular and genetic approaches to test specific hypotheses concerning symbiotic association. We will: (1) probe the cellular dynamics of mycangial colonization, including investigating selection, persistence/maintenance, turnover, and competition in the mycangia using microbiological and cellular (e.g., microscopic) methods, (2) identify genetic mechanisms that mediate fungal symbioses, e.g., what fungal genes/network are important for colonization and fitness within the mycangia, and (3) construct gene expression profiles (i.e., transcriptomics) of the fungus during mycangial colonization to help define the evolutionary processes that has led to fungal-mycangial symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Importantly and in contrast to other 2D materials, these properties can be systematically varied and studied within the same family, without changing elemental composition and type of interatomic bonds in the material. These unique features make MXenes equally interesting for fundamental science and application development, where they can be used in new planar and flexible devices, leading to new technologies and significant economic impacts. Some of these applications that are researched now include health monitoring sensors, high performance energy harvesting and storage systems, and chemo-photothermal cancer therapy. However, the adhesion of MXenes, which is critical in many of these applications, has yet to be systematically investigated. To date, there have only been a few theoretical studies of the adhesive behavior of MXenes, with little to no experimental data. In a broader sense, experimental determination of adhesive properties of MXenes will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental relationships between adhesion and atomic structures for low dimensional materials. This could revolutionize the modern materials and manufacturing industries in harnessing the adhesion for coatings and planar devices made of low dimensional materials.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to: (i) systematically investigate the adhesive interactions of MXenes at the atomistic, nano- and micrometer scales, (ii) using the unique advantages provided by MXenes, systematically and separately examine the effects of surface functional groups and monolayer thickness of 2D materials on their adhesive interactions, and (iii) explore the environmental effects on the adhesion of MXenes including surface water and oxidation process. To achieve the goals, we intend to: (1) utilize the atomistic scale contact-based experiments to investigate the effect of atomic structures and surface terminations on the adhesion, (2) employ nanoindentation to understand the interfacial traction-separation relations of MXenes with themselves and other materials, (3) explore the potential use of in-situ nano-shear-lag experiments to investigate the shear interactions of MXenes, (4) combine the multiscale modeling and the experimental results to understand the coupled adhesive mechanisms involving the surface defects, terminations, monolayer thickness, and (5) explore the possible evaluation of the effects of surface water and oxidation process on the adhesion of MXenes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optical Engineering is the field of study that focuses on the development and application of optics and photonics, including instrumentation. In this project, five educational activities are focused on transferring the knowledge of Optical Engineering. These educational activities include the following: (1) an online Optical Engineering Certificate; (2) a Summer Workshop in Advanced Optical Microscopic Techniques; (3) the creation of a STEM club in Lausanne Collegiate School so high-school students can develop science projects that are generally not possible in science classrooms; (4) a partnership with the Pink Palace Museum to expose the public to optics and microscopy; and (5) summer internships to undergraduate students, exposing them to research activities and new career paths. This project has several broader impacts. The most important broader impact is the enhancement of the imaging infrastructure for biological research and expanding our knowledge of cell behavior. Another significant broader impact is the increase in career opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. During this project, the PI will create research, education, and scientific outreach videos using the YouTube platform. These videos will provide hands-on demonstrations of building imaging systems and the use of optical tools to align them.

As demand for automation grows, enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, control, and smart charging systems become beneficial. However, while other technologies have been considerably revolutionized, the effort to develop a smart and efficient charging system for automation has not. Power electronics is a critical technology in the charging system to convert electric energy into a different level or type to deliver it to an electric load, such as batteries. Therefore, it must tackle the key challenges that prevent us from obtaining a smart, compact, and efficient charging system. As an effort to overcome the challenges, wireless power transfer technology has been explored to reduce the charging error and remove manual intervention to charge their batteries. It can eliminate heavy wire cables, connectors, and power plug failure resulting from dust, dirt, and other environmental factors. Moreover, the autonomous driving technology makes this technology beneficial because they can go to the charging station when their batteries run out. However, current power converters for wireless power transfer are limited in maximizing performance because of the available technologies and designs. This proposed research aims to develop a high-frequency power converter to miniaturize a wireless power transfer system efficiently and investigate pioneering charging methodologies for battery-powered vehicles. This research will accelerate advances in various applications such as transportation electrification and renewable energy technologies by improving the battery charging methodology. Broader transformative impacts are also anticipated from the proposed research into undergraduate and graduate curricula and the involvement of undergraduate and underrepresented students in research. Also, outreach to K-12 students and local industries will be pursued to introduce wireless power transfer and power-electronic circuits and ensure the broad transformative impact of the research activities.<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate new design techniques to improve power density and performance of power electronics while studying innovative approaches that enhance the charging ability in the WPT system. The research will be performed through the intertwined thrusts that involve: i) designing and implementing a high-frequency resonant converter with magnetic resonant coupling coils to increase power density efficiently, ii) investigating a bidirectional wireless power transfer system using self-synchronous rectification and control system to provide Vehicle-to-Grid capability, and iii) exploring advanced wireless power transfer charging approaches such as vehicle-to-vehicle and dynamic charging to reduce the charging time by diversifying the charging methods. The dependence of the circuit performance on the switching devices, magnetic designs, gate drive circuitry, and compensation network topology will be explored in detail. The PI will simulate the proposed system in the multiphysics software to evaluate human exposure to electromagnetic fields due to high-power operation at high frequencies.

Data will be used from arrays of ground-based magnetometers from high-to-equatorial latitudes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The wave guiding properties of such materials depend on an underlying spatial pattern of individual oscillator elements. While the behavior associated with simple patterns that tessellate the plane using regular polygons is well understood, there is a gap in our knowledge of the ability of other classes of patterns to steer, guide, and localize waves. This project will fill this gap by discovering radically new wave-guiding physics associated with such new classes of patterns, including fractals with self-similar features at multiple scales. The experimental part of this work will uncover solutions to the problems of fabricating acoustic crystals with a desired pattern, as well as characterizing the pattern of a given crystal, opening up new research directions in materials science, acoustics, and mechanics. The project?s collaborative research ecosystem, where pure mathematics meets computational modeling and physical validation, will provide unique training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for postdoctoral researchers. Outreach programs will expose middle- and high-school students and teachers to advanced topics in geometry, topology, and dynamics through dedicated and hands-on activities.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of wave-guiding metamaterials that can be characterized as hyperbolic or fractal lattices, as well as to the ability to physically realize such structures for experimental validation or design. It will achieve this outcome by formulating a theoretical framework for the classification of topological dynamics and of the possible manifestations of the bulk-boundary principle in hyperbolic and fractal lattices. The research will further demonstrate how intrinsic degrees of freedom of such lattices may be controlled to achieve new forms of wave steering, phase control, edge and bulk mode localization, and topological pumping. The experimental effort will demonstrate bioinspired packing and design solutions for large-scale fabrication of aperiodic lattices. The project will expand our knowledge about the collective dynamics of lattices, and will deliver analysis tools, mathematical models, and experimental platforms that will help chart the complex landscape of novel lattice geometries and their possible application for future material and structural designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
