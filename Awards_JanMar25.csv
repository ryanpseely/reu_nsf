Unlike explicit labels, preference feedback is often easier to collect and can be particularly valuable in subjective tasks where defining ideal outcomes is difficult. However, real-world preference data are often noisy, sparse, and heterogeneous, posing significant challenges to existing statistical methods. For example, recommendation systems may encounter incomplete feedback from users who abandon tasks due to fatigue or provide inconsistent inputs due to individual biases. This project aims to address the challenges of learning from preference feedback by developing robust statistical methods and advancing the theoretical foundations of preference-based learning. Additionally, it seeks to prepare students to tackle these challenges by integrating the research findings into innovative teaching platforms and educational curricula.<br/><br/>The project will focus on three key areas of learning from preference feedback: ranking from pairwise comparisons, user-item rating systems, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. To advance the field, the project will (1) develop robust algorithms for ranking that account for ill-conditioned sampling mechanisms and relax parametric modeling assumptions; (2) propose new estimation and uncertainty quantification methods for user-item ratings that work effectively in sparse and heterogeneous settings; and (3) introduce novel frameworks for reinforcement learning that incorporate ?out-of-list? preference feedback while addressing the issue of distribution shifts. Through these contributions, the project will bridge the gap between statistical theory and practical applications, creating tools to enhance decision-making systems across diverse domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Substance use diagnosis represents a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally, but access to effective substance use treatment remains a challenge. Mobile technologies such as smartphones promise broad treatment access, but it is unclear how treatment effectiveness may vary across populations, neighborhoods, and environments. This research shows how different types of neighborhood and environmental characteristics can impact mobile technology-delivered substance use treatment, advancing individualized treatment customization, improving treatment effectiveness, and reducing the public health burden of substance use.  <br/><br/>This research leverages the results of a large randomized clinical trial of a mobile health substance use treatment to advance understanding of environmental impacts on substance use behavior change. Geospatial analysis of environmental and behavioral data provides empirical evidence to indicate how exposures to geographic factors in both the residential neighborhood and during daily travel impact the attitudinal and behavioral mechanisms and outcomes of treatment.

At the centers of many galaxies are SMBHs, which are billions of times heavier than our Sun and can influence their surrounding galaxies. This research team will develop computer simulations that will lead to a better understanding of galaxies, SMBHs, and the Universe itself. This research will help answer fundamental questions, like how dark matter and dark energy influence the evolution of the Universe. This research will inspire students and the public while creating new opportunities for learning. This project will also support research mentorship programs, computer programming workshops, and a public planetarium show. Through integrated educational and outreach components, this project will also significantly enhance STEM education, ensuring its benefits extend beyond the research program.<br/><br/>The investigator will overcome the limitations of current cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation by focusing on two key areas: (1) advancing physically predictive models of galaxies at sub-parsec resolution and (2) developing computationally efficient, large-scale simulations that incorporate baryonic physics while satisfying observational constraints. In the first research area, the investigator will integrate detailed interstellar medium physics from the FIRE-3 model with new Lagrangian hyper-refinement techniques to explicitly resolve sub-parsec scale accretion onto SMBHs and multi-channel AGN feedback. This will allow the project to address major questions about the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies, create synthetic observations to interpret astrophysical data across cosmic time, and develop initial conditions for super-zoom simulations that explore accretion disk properties under varying host galaxy conditions. In the second research area, the investigator will develop a hybrid simulation framework that for the first time leverages empirical galaxy-halo models to enhance the computational efficiency and flexibility of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. This approach will produce thousands of large-volume simulations at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods and varying sub-grid feedback assumptions while satisfying by construction a variety of observational constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alkynes are a class of compounds containing a carbon-carbon triple bond. They have inherently high potential energy, which means they can undergo chemical reactions that are more energetically (thermodynamically) favorable than for the functional groups present in many other types of organic chemicals. This reactivity is perhaps most familiar in the form of an acetylene (ethyne, the simplest alkyne) torch, which gives off considerably more heat than, say, methane (natural gas) when combusted with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water. This energetic driving force can be used to design reactions using more complex alkynes to fuel the formation of reactive organic intermediates that undergo further reactions to give structurally interesting new molecules. These scientific advances have the possibility of opening new avenues for synthesis of compounds of value to other researchers engaged in the discovery of new compounds that have beneficial societal impact (e.g., pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or electronic/photonic device components). The student researchers who will engage in these studies will gain valuable skills from which they will launch their own careers. <br/><br/>Dr. Hoye and his research group at University of Minnesota will capitalize on the potential energy housed by the alkyne functional group in designed organic reactants to serve as the thermodynamic driver to allow access to transient reactive intermediates. In addition to several ongoing investigations of aspects of triyne to benzyne conversion (the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder or HDDA reaction), they will exploit a recently discovered, two-alkyne-to-carbene reaction. Furthermore, unknown transformations of alkynes to produce, for example, nitrenes, highly strained ring systems, and cyclic 1,2-dienes or 1,2,3-trienes will be explored. The discovery of new reactions will continue to be the most important 'products' to emerge from this program.

This CAREER project is driven by three fundamental research questions: (1) How to balance interpretability and accuracy in high-dimensional time series modeling and inference? (2) How to adaptively select time series models in real time for nonstationary data, while managing uncertainty? and (3) How to efficiently combine information from time series data with varying quality? This project aims to advance the field of time series analysis by developing novel statistical models, theories, and inference methods to address these issues. The results of this research will enhance dynamic network inference, facilitate real-time decision-making, and promote the integration of diverse time series data sources. This project will achieve educational impacts by integrating our research with mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, developing courses, and high-school outreach. Additionally, an interdisciplinary time series seminar series will be organized to promote cross-disciplinary interactions and provide students and junior researchers with exposure to diverse research in time series analysis.<br/><br/>This project will advance time series analysis on three main fronts: (1) develop Granger causality interpretable, recurrent neural network-based high-dimensional time series models to balance interpretability and accuracy; (2) develop an online, distribution-free procedure for adaptive time series model selection in nonstationary settings, addressing uncertainty via conformal miscoverage rate calibration; and (3) introduce new methods to efficiently combine time series data with different granularities and to impute data under general missing patterns. Underlying this research agenda is our overarching goal to tackle challenges due to the high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, nonstationarity, different granularity, and mixed quality and completeness of modern time series data. With an emphasis on statistical inference, we seek novel solutions by integrating existing statistical frameworks (Granger causality, model confidence sets, and factor models) with contemporary ML approaches (RNNs, model predictive control, and transfer learning). The results developed through our project will advance innovation in time series analysis, bridge the gaps between interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and black-box algorithms, and promote the use of time series data collected from diverse sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hosts thus experience strong selection to avoid contracting an infection. This research will advance our understanding of the evolution of host strategies to avoid contact with parasites. Researchers for this project propose that hosts avoid their parasites through dispersal, the permanent movement between sites. This idea is important because it asserts that dispersal, a widespread behavior, drives rates of contact with parasites and evolves as part of hosts? defense against infection. The proposed work will use experiments and field surveys to test parasites as drivers of dispersal evolution. The project will also create educational programs that engage community college transfer students in scientific research. <br/><br/>The main idea of this work is that dispersal strategies evolve to be sensitive to infection risk. The researchers predict that hosts evolve to disperse early in an epidemic, when infection risk is low. The work will conduct experiments with a free-living nematode and its natural parasites. The researchers will track the evolution of dispersal strategies under parasite selection and identify the genetics and mechanisms of adaptation. They will also test if dispersal limits selection for other defenses. Finally, they will assess whether dispersal reduces infection risk in the wild, by observing the natural distribution of parasites. Community college students will contribute to this work through a research course at the local community college and a summer research experience for incoming transfer students. A bridge course will connect transfer students with research and provide academic support. Community college transfer students are more likely to identify as low-income and first-generation, and this work will promote their success in STEM while advancing fundamental knowledge of parasites as selective agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address three fundamental questions aimed at advancing understanding of extreme precipitation: 1) how does the precipitation distribution depend on spatial and temporal scales? 2) what are the comparative roles of aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing in determining the precipitation distribution? and 3) how do stratospheric aerosol injections impact extreme precipitation changes? These questions are specifically motivated by the need to better understand the value of high-resolution modeling for understanding precipitation extremes, to understand if aerosol forcing can explain the discrepancy between observed and modeled changes to extreme precipitation events over the past few decades, and to understand why extreme precipitation decreases despite holding temperatures fixed in model projections of stratospheric aerosol injection. The scientific goals of this project are in line with the principal investigator?s goal to build a career around understanding precipitation extremes as they unfold over the next decades. An educational component is also integrated into this project providing research experiences for undergraduates related to the science objectives; training students on the use of data for real world problems co-identified in workshops with highway engineers; and integrating the science results into graduate and undergraduate level courses. <br/><br/>The principal investigator has previously developed a novel approach to the analysis of the precipitation distribution by defining shift and intensity modes of the distribution. The shift mode is defined as a uniform shift in the amount distribution to higher or lower intensity by a set amount, while the intensity mode is defined as an increase in the amount distribution by the same factor across intensity bins. In the context of these two modes of the precipitation distribution, this project will test the hypotheses that 1) increasing the resolution of the precipitation dataset shifts the precipitation distribution to higher intensities without changing its shape; 2) aerosol forcing over the past several decades has had a larger impact on the intensity mode of the precipitation distribution relative to the shift mode, and that this impact differs from that of greenhouse gases; and 3) stratospheric aerosol injection masks the temperature effects on the precipitation distribution, leaving only the direct response to determine the distribution change, which differs from that of the temperature response in terms of its impact on the shift and increase modes. Results of this work will be used to produce information co-designed during workshops with Northeast US highway engineers, with an integrated educational component to allow students to gain experience in addressing stakeholder needs related to precipitation extremes. In addition to supporting the principal investigator, the project requests funds for a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and one undergraduate student researcher each summer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups may be understood as collections of symmetries, whose study was motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role. Group theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences. In recent years, research in group theory has had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents by providing a way to view an abstract group as a group of matrices, whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems which seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure and representations of certain so-called local subgroups, which reflect numerical information encoded by the group. The award will also support educational activities centering graduate student mentorship and undergraduate research. These activities include local workshops for Colorado-area graduate students and postdocs and a Directed Reading Program. The latter provides a ""research-like"" experience for undergraduates, in which undergraduate mentees and graduate mentors work under the guidance of the PI to study a topic outside of the students? normal coursework. The activities in the grant also include supervising undergraduate researchers, Ph.D. students, and postdocs, who will work with the PI on problems within the scope of the project.<br/><br/>The problems of primary interest in this project are related to variations and consequences of the McKay?Navarro (MN) and Brauer?s Height Zero (BHZ) Conjectures. The PI and collaborators have recently proved the case of the prime 2 of the MN Conjecture, and many of the goals in this proposal are also aimed at establishing strategies for attacking the case of odd primes. In the case of BHZ, which was one of the longest-standing local-global conjectures, the PI and coauthors completed the proof of the conjecture in its entirety, and have been working toward stronger forms of the conjecture. The problems will involve the study of blocks of groups of Lie type, the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type, and the interaction between the two. Since the effect of various group actions on parameterizations of characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This leads to interesting and unique transport properties and potential to unlocking a new generation of efficient solid-state energy conversion devices. Results of this project will help gain fundamental understanding of the properties of topological materials, allowing their synthesis with most useful properties and usable forms while preserving their unique attributes. This approach is likely to ultimately enable a new class of efficient energy conversion devices based on strategically designed topological materials. This project also humanizes the fundamental concepts of charge carrier transport through extensive set of outreach and education activities. The research team uses a physical embodiment of charge carrier motion to explain it to a broad general audience and uses creative ways of conveying these concepts and inspiring interest in science.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>While transport properties of topological materials have strong potential for use in efficient solid-state devices, little progress has been made moving towards their use due to challenges in designing and synthesizing topological material in useful forms. Crucial to this progress is understanding the critical length scales over which topological transport dominates, eliminating stray magnetic fields and reducing externally applied magnetic fields, and understanding transport across magnetic phase transitions. This project addresses these gaps using magneto-thermoelectric transport as a probe to gain deep insight into the motion of charge carriers. Magneto-thermoelectric transport measurements uniquely interrogate the interplay between heat, charge, and spin with the electronic structure of the material. The principal investigator uses magneto-thermoelectric transport to tease apart the intertwined transport signatures due to the topological band structure itself from the transport signatures stemming from physical length scales of samples, parabolic bands, and magnetic textures. Results of this work determine the fundamental mechanisms underlying and controlling charge carrier transport in topological materials, informing targeted materials design for enhanced device applications using topological materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This program focuses on two of the most important astrophysical effects, determining where galaxies form and what shapes they have. Prof. Blazek?s team will pursue several linked themes leading to robust, sophisticated cosmological analyses of LSST data.

Intrinsic alignment (IA) and galaxy bias represent two of the most critical challenges to these measurements. This program combines Blazek?s leading expertise in IA with novel simulation and artificial intelligence / machine learning techniques. Applying a semi-analytic approach to IA and bias on gravity-only simulations will enable production of mock galaxy catalogs in large cosmological volumes with a wide range of IA properties. By developing sophisticated emulation with neural networks, the research will accelerate the process of creating and analyzing simulated galaxy data, providing direct simulation-based modeling. These innovations will enable Rubin-LSST data analyses not possible with existing methods and will broaden the discovery potential of future data through measurements of IA as a cosmic probe.

Traditional microelectronics face increasing energy demands and shrinking size limits. Spin-based devices, on the other hand, can potentially run with lower power and higher performance. However, managing the direction of electron spins becomes essential at very small scales. To address this, the research team will design oxide crystals with carefully tuned symmetries, enabling spin currents to be generated in the exact orientation needed for switching tiny magnetic bits. By enlarging the pool of materials that can perform this function, the project aims to spark development of more compact, faster, and energy-conscious computing technologies.

The principal investigator will fabricate epitaxial bilayer heterostructures in which a crystalline oxide with strong spin-orbit coupling is interfaced with a magnetic layer capable of detecting and switching in response to spin signals. By controlling substrate orientation and strain conditions, the team will establish precise crystal symmetries that break conventional spin-current constraints, allowing a charge flow to produce a spin polarization component oriented perpendicular to the film plane. The research team will quantify spin-torque efficiency by combining spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements under varied temperatures, film thicknesses, and anisotropic strain states. These data will clarify the role of crystal symmetry in determining the magnitude and direction of spin polarization. In addition, the research will integrate correlated electron states, such as polar or superconducting phases, to uncover new functionalities that arise when out-of-plane spin currents coexist with these effects.

Unlike traditional materials, living tissues are made of responsive and adaptive cells. They can change their structure or coordinate their movements in response to mechanical or chemical signals. These abilities make living tissues dynamic and flexible. They also lead to complex mechanical transitions in processes like wound healing, embryonic development, and cancer invasion. This project will investigate how cellular adaptive responses to the environment influence the larger-scale behavior of tissues. It will create a link between cellular biology and material properties, providing insights into treating related diseases. Moreover, this connection can advance the understanding of living materials and inspire the design of new materials to replace damaged tissues. The PI?s educational and outreach activities aim to foster interdisciplinary studies between fields like physics, biology, and materials science, and broaden the views of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This research project investigates the mechanics of living tissues as adaptive materials by incorporating cellular adaptability into shape-based tissue models. Cellular adaptability, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and coordinated cell movements, is a key factor distinguishing living tissues from traditional soft materials. The research will explore how these adaptive behaviors influence phenomena like jamming and glass transitions, rheological responses, and emergent instabilities on the tissue level. The findings are expected to advance understanding of biological processes involving these phenomena, such as wound healing and cancer invasion. They will also provide insights into the interplay between cellular sensing and responding mechanisms and emergent tissue-level behaviors. This project will develop a new adaptive tissue model to integrate biological and soft matter physics perspectives. Using this model, computational and theoretical studies will produce experimentally testable and clinically relevant predictions for tuning tissue-level mechanical properties as needed. These predictions will support future collaborations between theoretical and experimental researchers, while the open-source computational tools developed through this work will facilitate further studies in tissue mechanics and adaptive materials.

The PI will continue to push these directions, as well as new ones stemming from the attendant technological developments. Furthermore, the project will integrate these pursuits with significant outreach, training, and mentorship efforts encompassing students across all tiers of education from primary to undergraduate to graduate.

The PI will further develop his new approach with Le Hung to the Breuil?Mezard Conjecture, which is based on an analogy with mirror symmetry, in order to cover general groups and fields. The PI will also extend the higher Siegel?Weil formula, proved for non-singular terms in joint work with Yun?Zhang, to more general terms, with the eventual goal of completing a higher version of the Kudla program over function fields. In another direction, the PI will geometrize the classical theory of the Weil representation, and the local theta correspondence, for p-adic groups. These have applications to the categorical Local Langlands correspondence, especially towards Langlands functoriality and the explicit construction of eigensheaves.

I-CPS is characterized by multiple CPS services functioning concurrently within the same environment, high involvement of domain experts and everyday users in decision-making processes, real-time interactions with other systems, and operation within uncertain and constantly changing physical environments. Examples of such systems include smart cities, smart agriculture, and intelligent transportation, among others. However, stakeholders often hesitate to trust these systems due to a lack of explainability, which raises concerns about reliability, especially in safety-critical areas. Additionally, while advancements in deep learning have enabled powerful CPS capabilities, understanding of these systems is declining. Despite the significance and urgency of enabling explainability for i-CPS, research in explainable CPS with AI-driven components is still in its infancy. This research aims to develop explainable and trustworthy i-CPS capable of justifying their decisions and incorporating field operators? queries and domain knowledge to adapt to evolving environments.<br/><br/>The technical contributions to CPS research and education encompass four thrusts. Thrust I develops a new explainable architecture with formal explainers that interpret individual components of i-CPS and their interactions. Innovations include the first explainable CPS architecture, novel formal methods-based approaches addressing five layers of i-CPS, and explainable online decision support for ?what if? scenarios. Thrust II formalizes and incorporates user domain knowledge, specifications, and feedback to enhance the learning-enabled components of CPS. Key advances include developing new formal knowledge distillation and unlearning approaches with uncertainty quantification that quickly adapt the system to shifting distributions in a lifelong evolving deployment. Thrust III evaluates the proposed methods through a real-world emergency response deployment in Nashville, TN, involving multiple CPS-based city services and stakeholders from different departments. Innovations include a logic-based LLM-enabled system that connects our proposed explainers to field operators, real-world deployment principles, and qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess explainability and impact. Thrust IV develops an interdisciplinary education plan. The key innovation is to bring rigorousness and explainability to CPS classes in Computer Science and create a new course, CPS in the field, for multi-disciplinary students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current manufacturing systems lack the flexibility to produce existing and new biopharmaceuticals on demand. This is mainly because biomanufacturing processes are highly complex and variable, with hundreds of biological, physical, and chemical factors dynamically interacting at molecular, cellular, and macroscopic scales.  Further, bioprocessing mechanisms are not systematically understood, and data are often very limited, sparse, and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to optimize biomanufacturing processes via a bioprocess-specific AI that integrates uncertainty, intelligence, and science (i.e., systems and synthetic biology). Leveraging emerging sensing technologies that can monitor bioprocesses at molecular and cellular scales, this AI can also efficiently decode fundamental mechanisms. Moreover, by transferring this AI to industry practice, it is hoped this research will help make life-saving biopharmaceuticals rapidly available by accelerating biomanufacturing systems integration and automation with dramatically improved capabilities. The project will in parallel create a world-leading workforce pipeline from training the current workforce to educating (under)graduate and K-12 students. <br/><br/>This project will create a mechanism-informed AI platform on Biological Systems-of-Systems to enable the quick assembly of flexible and robust biomanufacturing systems. To support biomanufacturing systems integration and accelerate the development of flexible optimal robust manufacturing systems, this research will answer two fundamental questions: (1) how to create a unified knowledge representation that enables integration of heterogeneous data collected at molecular, cellular, and macroscopic scales in different production processes; and (2) how to enable sample-efficient and interpretable learning for fundamental mechanisms and optimal control strategies within and across different scales. These questions will be addressed through three integrated research efforts: (i) creating a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG) hybrid (mechanistic + statistical) model with a modular design capable of representing spatial-temporal causal interdependencies from molecular- to cellular- to macroscopic scales for different biomanufacturing processes; (ii) developing interpretable federated learning to quickly fuse sparse and heterogeneous data collected from different production processes to advance scientific understanding and track critical latent states through sequential Bayesian inference on the pKG; and (iii) constructing new provably efficient model-based reinforcement learning schemes on Bayesian pKG, accounting for model uncertainty, informing design of experiments for digital twin calibration, and streamlining the policy search on optimal robust biomanufacturing systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures, however, leads these alloys to develop a serious problem known as sensitization that can eventually result in catastrophic failures. This project investigates the fundamental mechanisms controlling the sensitization process in Al-Mg, which are governed by complex atomic interactions with defects in the material?s internal structure created during manufacturing. These findings will ultimately guide the development of new material processing strategies that mitigate the sensitization process and extend the lifetime of these materials by several times their current limit. As Al-Mg alloys are already used extensively in critical transportation and energy infrastructure, this research presents immediate potential for large economic and sustainability improvements. The education and outreach efforts included in this project introduce materials science education in venues and contexts classically associated with the humanities. In an ongoing collaboration with the Cincinnati Art Museum, educational Science of Art programming is being introduced via QR-code links located alongside select objects within the museum, and a new interdisciplinary undergraduate course is being offered that uses the unique and publicly intriguing lens of sword-making to introduce fundamental concepts in physical metallurgy and materials science to undergraduates outside science and engineering majors.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project tests three major hypotheses regarding the fundamental mechanisms by which microstructural features control the nucleation and growth of grain boundary precipitates in 5xxx series Al-Mg alloys, a defect-controlled precipitation process governed by complex diffusion pathways. Precipitation of the anodic Mg-rich beta-phase along grain boundaries in these super-saturated Al-Mg alloys leads to increased susceptibility to intergranular corrosion in a process known as sensitization, which can compound over time at environmental temperatures and result in catastrophic failures. Carefully designed experiments are employed that take advantage of novel characterization techniques to make statistically relevant direct observations of the nanoscale precipitates along the grain boundaries, addressing uncertainties regarding the underlying mechanisms and diffusion modes dictating the nucleation and growth, along with the precipitate distribution?s consequent impact on the sensitization response. Establishing the contributions that specific microstructural features play in the progression of this type of precipitation, notably as a function of temperature and configuration, enables the development of new processing strategies that lower long-term sensitization response in these alloys and increase service life. This research answers pertinent questions inherent to many systems possessing detrimental nanoscale precipitates that nucleate preferentially upon defect structures, and provides critical new experimental studies exploring the interplay between microstructural elements and multi-stage diffusion pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the research team will create a climatology of QLCS events over the past 10+ years, including advanced weather radar information about drop sizes and shapes, that will be used alongside idealized numerical modeling to answer questions about the structure and impacts of QLCSs.  The primary societal impact from the research will be improved understanding, and potentially forecasting, of a significant weather hazard that affects lives and property.

In natural soils, the breakdown of bedrock controls the amount of phosphorus available. Similar processes are also important for accumulating soil organic matter, which is a major reservoir of nutrients, supporting soil health and capturing atmospheric carbon. As humans expand efforts to accumulate more soil organic matter, they also capture phosphorus, but how phosphorus is involved in soil organic matter stabilization remains a significant knowledge gap. The goal of this project is to understand the role of phosphorus in the stabilization and persistence of soil organic matter. This project will use laboratory and field experiments, spectroscopic, and microscopic tools, to assess the ability of phosphorus on mineral surfaces to bind soil organic matter. The outcomes of this research will provide benefits that support agricultural productivity by providing the basis for future strategies such as targeted plant breeding and soil microbe manipulation that can access the phosphorus within soil organic matter. This research integrates the education goals of improving public understanding of soils and improving soil science education. These education activities will provide continuing adult education through citizen science projects as well as open pathways to careers in science and natural resources for undergraduate students by infusing statistics and data literacy into soil science curricula.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses this central question: what role does phosphorus play in stabilizing soil carbon? To address this question, the specific aims are: 1) Describe the mechanisms by which organic and inorganic phosphorus control mineral associated organic matter adsorption and stabilization by loading common soil minerals with various phosphorus molecules and comparing adsorption of organic matter under laboratory conditions, 2) Determine the phosphorus forms that exist in and relate to soil organic matter in phosphorus-rich and phosphorus-limited ecosystems by performing a series of physical and chemical phosphorus and soil organic matter fractionations in natural soils, and 3) Quantify organic and inorganic phosphorus control of mineral associated organic matter dynamics within phosphorus-rich and phosphorus-limited ecosystems by deploying minerals loaded with common phosphorus molecules in the field. This project will demonstrate how phosphorus acts as an anchor for soil organic matter to stabilize on mineral surfaces, fundamentally controlling soil organic matter persistence, and linking the carbon and phosphorus cycles.<br/><br/>This proposal is supported by the Life & Environments through Time (LET) program, the Ecosystem Science (ES) program and The Water, Landscape, and Critical Zone Processes (WaLCZ) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the advent of high-resolution imaging technologies and biochemistry techniques over the last 30 years has shown this is not the case. In fact, paleontologists have recently made numerous remarkable discoveries of fossilized cells and soft tissues in fossil bones of dinosaurs and many other extinct animals. These discoveries are forcing paleontologists to revise models of fossilization to account for the preservation of biologic molecules in the fossil record. However, it remains unclear how such remarkable preservation occurs, which materials are most resilient to decay, and why. This project will identify which portions of bone material are most resilient to decay both before and after burial. These answers will help paleontologists and archeologists revise models of fossilization and discover new instances of molecular preservation in fossils, and they could also see future applications more broadly in the fields of forensics, historical art conservation, and tissue engineering (such as for wound healing and bone regeneration). In addition, this CAREER award will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of North Dakota in the application of new and cutting-edge analytical techniques. The researchers will also create and run a novel hands-on activity about fossilization with regional K-8 classes and youth STEM camps, and develop a high school biology curriculum module for regional schools which explores the structure of protein molecules. Integration of this research with education activities during this CAREER award will annually serve ~500 K-12 students from rural communities of eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. Altogether, these efforts will bring scientific attention to rural communities of this region, create exciting new research infrastructure and opportunities for undergraduates at the state?s namesake university, and foster broad participation and public engagement with exceptional fossils recovered from the state, such as the mummified dinosaur ?Dakota.? <br/><br/>Through integrating modern trace element geochemistry and proteomics approaches, this research will illuminate how several environmental variables influence initial decay of collagen I, a bone structural protein, after death. Two complementary forms of high-resolution mass spectrometry will be completed on naturally-weathered bones from Texas and Alaska to determine the influences of ambient temperature on the sequence-level decay of collagen. To further explore the importance of entombing sediments on protein decay, the same analyses will also be performed on bones subjected to decay after simulated ?burial? and exposure to flowing, simulated ?groundwaters? in a year-long laboratory experiment. Results from these three complementary projects will clarify relationships between chemical alteration and the sequence-level decay of collagen, which will in turn be used to elucidate preservation mechanisms which can promote the long-term stability of proteins over geologic timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different traits enable plants to thrive in these contrasting habitats. Knowledge of these characteristics and how they came to be is essential for understanding plant diversification. However, measuring relevant traits for many different plants using traditional methods is slow and expensive. This research will develop new methods to measure plant traits on museum specimens using leaf spectra, which characterize the way different colors of light reflect off leaves. These methods will significantly speed up trait measurements at a global scale and revolutionize our ability to understand how traits and their combinations enable plants to live in different environments. The project will train the next generation of researchers in the cutting-edge and rapidly growing area of spectroscopy. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain research experience, new course materials will be developed, and workshops on spectral biology and herbaria will provide training to scientists.

The methods and software developed will build capacity for study of natural history collections.<br/><br/>This research will explicitly assess the evolution of function associated with independent biome shifts in two widely distributed tropical plant lineages, the Brongniartieae (Fabaceae) and Bombacoideae (Malvaceae). The project will use multivariate phylogenetic comparative method approaches to test 1) if plants in different biomes occupy different functional hypervolumes, 2) if biome shifts lead to differences in evolutionary trait dynamics, such as shifts in rates of evolution, and 3) whether plant traits and combinations of traits evolve convergently in different biomes or if certain traits enable biome shifting in the first place. New, highly sampled time-calibrated phylogenies will be generated using phylogenomic data and Bayesian analyses.

More precisely, the shapes are complex projective manifolds and the linear invariants are Hodge structures. The famous ?Hodge conjecture?, first presented in 1950 at the International Congress of Mathematicians, states that the essential geometry of a complex projective manifold is recovered by its Hodge structure. As one of the Millennium Prize Problems, this conjecture has attached to it a one million dollar prize for a solution. While complex projective manifolds involve a bit of abstraction to define, they are fundamental objects in mathematics and physics; for example, the ?Calabi-Yau varieties? are a certain class of complex projective manifolds which can appear as the small dimensions of the universe in string theory. The main research goal of this project is to study the Hodge structures of Calabi-Yau varieties?to both gain insight into Hodge theory more generally for all complex projective manifolds, and to increase the depth of our understanding of Calabi-Yau varieties.

Additionally, the project aims to study and prove general results concerning variations of Hodge structure (VHS). Joint work of the PI with S. Tayou is advancing our understanding of finiteness properties of Z-polarized VHS, and it now seems within reach that conjectures of Deligne and Simpson on the algebraicity of the non-abelian Hodge locus can be resolved. The approach is novel, incorporating ideas from hyperbolic geometry. The PI will also pursue results about period mappings for Calabi-Yau variations of Hodge structure, such as questions of boundedness of moduli of Calabi-Yau varieties of various classes, and under what circumstances Torelli theorems hold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Controlling the crystalline and amorphous structures that make up all semicrystalline polymers remains a fundamental issue for developing and optimizing their properties and applications. It is therefore important to understand the crystalline and amorphous structures of semicrystalline polymers. Most previous work focused on analysis of the crystalline structures. In this project, the PI aims at understanding the amorphous structure and the crystalline-amorphous interface of semicrystalline polymers. Using advanced spectroscopic techniques to understand interfacial and amorphous structures together with their crystalline counterparts, and studying dynamical processes, the project is focused on elucidating the crystallization and molecular re-organization pathways of semicrystalline polymers. A successful project will contribute to controlling the structures and properties of semicrystalline polymers and developing novel energy-efficient processing approaches.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The crystallization pathways of semicrystalline polymers have been debated for many decades, partly as a result of lack of understanding of the  amorphous structure in the initial state as well as during the crystallization process. In this project, the PI and his team aim at elucidating the amorphous structure of semicrystalline polymers, making use of structural information obtainable through advanced techniques. 13CH3-labeled poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and 13CH-labeled poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) racemate, which form stereocomplex crystals, are chosen as a model system. The PI will analyze intermolecular distances between PLLA and PDLA and fractions of closely paired racemate in both amorphous and crystalline regions by applying state-of-the-art solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Direct comparisons of the amorphous and crystalline structures will be used to elucidate the crystallization pathway of PLA racemate. In a second thrust, molecular-level information about the reorganization process upon heating of solution- and melt-grown PLLA crystals will be obtained by quantitative analysis for chain-folded structures at the crystal-amorphous interface in addition to crystalline chain dynamics. In both topics, molecular weight effects will be investigated. Ultimately, fundamental understanding of amorphous and interfacial structures will contribute to revealing the crystallization and re-organization pathways of semicrystalline polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Capsules are used in a broad range of technologies including those for medicine, food science, energy discovery, textiles and the like. The fundamental issue that the proposed research will address is how to localize precursors to the polymer shell (monomers and initiators) such that the shell is grown around the liquid droplet, essentially shrink wrapping it. To this end, emulsions will be used as a platform for capsule formation, with droplets of one liquid in a continuous phase of the other (the droplet will become the core liquid). The ability to produce such capsules is important for creating new materials that meet societal needs; for example, capsules with a protective polymer shell and core of a salt hydrate solid-liquid phase change material can be used to passively manage heat, so that air conditioning does not have to be used as often. An important component to consider is that for these capsules to be used multiple times, the shell must be strong enough to prevent leakage but also impermeable so that the composition does not change. Notably, this research can be applied to different core liquids and polymer shells relevant to other applications, such as for carbon capture, pesticide delivery, or additive manufacturing, to name a few. Through this research, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in how to design and implement research; how to collect, organize, and report data; and how to collaborate across disciplines. <br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the critical need to understand how confinement of initiators and monomers in emulsions impacts the production of capsules and their properties. Limitations to an interfacial polymerization approach are that the liquid core is contaminated and that only a few polymer chemistries can be used, thus restricting composition and performance-related properties such as permeability. To overcome this, the proposed research will (i) use modified particles as both surfactant and initiator for radical polymerization of monomers located in the emulsion continuous phase; and (ii) leverage double emulsions in which the interphase contains monomers to polymerize around the inner droplet. For this purpose, the interface is defined as the zone where two domains touch and the interphase as a self-contained region between two domains (thus flanked by two interfaces).These two distinct approaches are supported by initial results from the PI?s lab and will provide unprecedented control of capsule composition (both shell and core) such that structure-property-application relationships can be defined.  The PI has access to all resources and infrastructure required to complete this work, and the research component is complemented by the training and professional development of undergraduate and graduate student researchers, as well as development of a hands-on module to be incorporated into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research indicates that innovative activity in science is slowing. The causes behind this decline are unknown. Addressing this issue is hindered by our limited ability to empirically test how individual scientists make breakthrough discoveries. The researchers draw on the interdisciplinary expertise of a team with deep knowledge in sociology, agent-based modeling, and philosophy of science. By combining both theoretical and empirical studies, this award helps science to further understand the causes of, and solutions to, our declining rate of innovation. By providing a deeper understanding of the factors that drive or hinder innovation, the award informs policies aimed at fostering a more conducive environment for scientific breakthroughs. <br/><br/>The supported research uses a novel mixed-method approach, where empirically informed agent-based simulation models are combined with empirical analysis of the scientific record. This allows for a comparison of both internal factors---those related to the structure and dynamics of scientific content---and external factors that operate outside and influence the body of scientific knowledge. Internal factors involve the proliferation of scientific knowledge, while external factors encompass funding incentives, pressure to publish, and the challenges of remote collaboration. To increase innovation, it is essential to implement actionable policies that mitigate these factors and guide scientists in their contributions to scientific knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematical terms, a ?group? is a collection of elements combined with an operation that links any two elements to form a third, adhering to closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility principles. A ?group action? involves applying elements of a group to another set?s elements, transforming them in structured ways, such as through rotations or reflections. These transformations are crucial in many data processing applications, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), image registration, and multi-reference alignment. Each observation in these problems involves a common, unknown signal and an unknown group element, with the primary goal being to infer both the signal and the group elements accurately. This project aims to significantly advance statistical understanding and develop effective methodologies for handling data influenced by group actions. The wide existence of such data ensures that the progress we make towards our objectives will have a great impact not only on the statistics and machine learning community but also on a much broader scientific community, including fields such as structural biology, computer vision, and signal processing. This project will have educational outcomes that result in curriculum development, teaching, and outreach activities, including activities to K-12 students through the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Academy. The project will advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.<br/><br/>This project is structured around three main aims, each designed to tackle distinct aspects of group actions. First, the PI will improve the accuracy of orbit recovery in scenarios where the prior distributions of group elements are non-uniform, developing computationally efficient procedures that are effective under realistic conditions. Second, the PI will develop theories and methods for group synchronization problems, particularly under high noise levels and in situations with incomplete data, aiming to reduce the error of group recovery and provide entrywise inference. Third, the PI will address theoretical and computational challenges in the multi-reference alignment problem, developing procedures specifically designed for the cyclic structural nature of data, thereby enabling more precise uncertainty quantification. Together, these aims will not only enhance the theoretical understanding of and the ability to analyze group actions but also lead to the development of accurate and computationally efficient algorithms designed to tackle real-world challenges in data analysis where group actions are integral.  This research project will have impacts more broadly, in that it will result in software development and in the education of technical experts. These experts will use this software to advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.  These activities will then advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has six stable isotopes whose ratios allow it to track oxygen content and biochemical reactions in seawater. So far, Selenium isotopes have proven difficult to measure accurately due to their low concentration. This project will develop new methods to measure Selenium isotopes. Water samples taken along a profile across the Eastern Pacific Ocean and from sediments in the Black Sea will be used. These samples have very low oxygen seawater. This low oxygen seawater provides ideal conditions to calibrate the isotopes of Selenium to oxygenation. The project includes education and training in stable isotope techniques in geosciences. Two graduate-level workshops on state-of-the art elemental isotope analysis will be held. Workshops will introduce advanced hands-on techniques and theory for trace element analysis. Also, middle- and high-school students will visit the research laboratory and learn about Selenium contamination in the local environment.<br/><br/>Selenium is a trace element that is both an essential micronutrient and a toxin at relatively low concentrations. It inhabits four oxidation states in surface environments and is comprised of six stable isotopes, the relative abundances of which are fractionated during biogeochemical reactions. Selenium isotope systematics therefore hold great promise for tracking its cycling in nature, including in reconstructions of paleo-environmental conditions using ancient sediments. However, the understanding of Selenium isotope mass balance in the modern ocean remains poor due to a lack of data. This project seeks to develop and refine methods for measuring Selenium isotopes in seawater and marine sediments. The research team will make the first phase-specific Se isotopes along transect through the East Pacific and through recent marine sediment cores with the goal of calibrating modern Selenium isotope mass balance in the oceans for use in reconstructions of paleo-oceanographic oxidation and nutrient dynamics. As part of the project, the team will host workshops for graduate students focused on state-of-the-art mass spectrometry for trace element isotope analysis.

Market failures prevent resources, such as labor and capital, from being used in the places where they are most valuable. While it is known that market failures are a feature of all economies and contribute to income differences across countries, the question of which types of households are affected most by these market failures is much less researched. This project makes progress on this gap by developing tools to connect and analyze multiple datasets that provide an extensive set of links in the economy between households and firms, between both households and firms and the government, and between the firms themselves. Understanding which groups benefit and which groups lose out from policies that address such market failures is vital to the design of approaches that maximize the welfare of any nation. The research outcomes could be essential for researchers and decisionmakers in shaping optimal U.S. policies and potentially enhancing the wellbeing of households and businesses.  <br/><br/>This award funds a research project that develops tools to estimate distortions?markups, markdowns, and taxes that prevents resources being allocated to their best uses?at a highly disaggregated level and trace them to individuals through arbitrary trade, employment, and financial networks. This methodology is applied to administrative data, where the research team can map out the flow of goods and money for the entire economy by linking firm-to-firm networks with firm-to-consumer, firm-to-lender, and firm-to-employee networks alongside ownership registries. These methods reveal how the burden of distortions is shared among households belonging to different regions, demographic groups, skill groups, and income levels. In addition, they enable answers to various questions, such as which distortions do the most to compress and expand the distribution of living standards; what trade-offs are observed in approaches designed to improve the impacts of distortions; and to what degree overlapping distortions necessitate our wide-ranging analysis as opposed to focusing on one specific distortion or sector at a time. The theory and methods are developed in a way that they can be applied to any country with similar data. This project advances knowledge in several ways. First, it operationalizes recent theoretical work on general equilibrium models of heterogeneous agents in distorted economic environments. Second, by assembling a complete empirical mapping of economic relationships between agents in an economy, it measures the distributional impact of the main distortions that are present in an economy (those on labor, capital, output, and intermediate inputs) throughout all sectors. This is relevant because studying the impact of reducing distortions in one specific market is influenced by distortions in other markets. Thus, to fully assess the trade-offs of reducing distortions, one needs to go beyond specific distortions and specific sectors. The results have the potential to significantly reshape how economists perceive the implications of market distortions and the policies responding to them. By addressing who bears the costs and who benefits from market distortions, a key theme for decisionmakers, the findings of this research could lead to optimal policies related to market failures and enhance the welfare of the U.S. population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ability to make sense of our acoustic surroundings relies on the brain being able to recognize patterns and predict what might come next. However, in real-world environments, sounds are rarely perfectly predictable, raising the question: how does the brain track information when patterns are uncertain or incomplete? This research seeks to understand how the brain extracts and organizes auditory information from complex, dynamic soundscapes. The work has broad implications for real-world applications, from improved audio technologies and assistive listening devices to shedding light on auditory processing challenges in specific clinical populations. <br/><br/>The project explores how the brain infers statistical structure from sound sequences, focusing on the way it builds an internal model of the world to interpret and predict auditory experiences. While past research has shown that the brain can recognize predictable patterns in sound, real-world listening often involves incomplete or stochastic sounds, making it unclear how this predictive process functions in natural environments. The investigator uses a combination of computational modeling, behavioral testing, and neurophysiological (EEG) experiments to study how the brain tracks complex statistical relationships and deeper temporal and multi-feature dependencies in sound sequences to guide perception. Individual differences, such as working memory capacity and perceptual sensitivity, are also evaluated for their effect on statistical tracking abilities. The project is structured around two key aims: (1) developing a theoretical framework for statistical inference in auditory processing, supported by behavioral and EEG experiments on structured sound sequences, and (2) examining how the brain integrates statistical information across multiple perceptual features. By building a comprehensive model of predictive coding in the auditory system, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how the brain processes real-world acoustic scenes and inform studies on auditory object perception, sensory integration, and cognitive differences in auditory inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People think of evolution occurring in geological time, with eras like the Dinosaur Age populated with different organisms from what we have on Earth today. Most studies of evolution, however, look at changes that occur in days or years in organisms that are all around us today. Scientists are realizing that rapid evolution is common and affects all organisms. For example, many agricultural pests in the USA are controlled by predators that attack and kill them, making insecticides unnecessary. Pea aphids represent a great example of this, because they are kept in check by predators. However, pea aphids can evolve resistance to predators. This rapid evolution raises the risk of greater crop damage. Despite their ability to evolve resistance, all the pea aphids do not become resistance to predators. There are also some that remain susceptible, creating a balance between resistance and susceptibility. This project aims to uncover how this balance is maintained, and how agricultural management practices can reduce the risks of agricultural pests becoming resistant. Understanding this balance will help to develop strategies to make US agriculture more resilient and increase the security and sustainability of our bioeconomy. The project will also provide hands-on research experiences to students with no prior experience. Public outreach events will engage farmers to share the results of the research broadly.<br/><br/>The research investigates the ecological-evolutionary dynamics of pea aphids and their parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. Aphidius ervi was deliberately introduced to North America as a biocontrol agent of pea aphids, particularly to control pea aphids as pests of alfalfa crops. Pea aphids are a leading model for investigating the evolutionary and ecological consequences of symbiosis because all populations harbor heritable symbionts that provide well-documented benefits. The most common and best studied facultative symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, confers resistance against A. ervi. Although evolutionary theory predicts that resistance traits will often be bimodal (either susceptible or highly resistant), pea aphids exhibit a full spectrum of resistance through different symbiont variants. Although the prevalences of different symbiont variants fluctuate (reflecting the intensity of parasitism and selection), the collective of symbionts across the spectrum of resistance appears to be stable. Furthermore, the ecological interactions between pea aphids and A. ervi are stable, in the sense that A. ervi is always present but abundances never get high enough to extirpate pea aphids. This ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions may itself be the product of the evolutionary stability of the symbionts that confer pea aphid resistance to A. ervi. The research will use field experiments, lab experiments and mathematical modeling to examine both the evolutionary and ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions, and whether this stability is generated by the interconnections between evolutionary and ecological dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on topological phases of matter, a novel class of materials that conduct electricity along their edges in a way that remains unaffected by defects or noise. This makes them ideal to improve quantum computations - which are notoriously sensitive to noise. This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrdinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrdinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. By studying resolvent expansions for adiabatic modulations of these crystals, the PI plans to show that interfaces support topologically protected surface states: three-dimensional analogues of the robust edge states emerging between two-dimensional topological phases. These projects require tools from spectral theory, multiscale analysis and topology that will serve the mathematical community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the last few hundred years many flows emitted from either the summit or rift zones have reached the ocean. If that were to occur today, lava would cut the main highway around the island and cross the densely inhabited coastal strip. Lava flows erupted from the SW rift zone in the last 200 years reached the coast in as little as 3 hours. Future eruptions could potentially travel even faster. Lava flow hazard assessment requires accurate data on the viscosity of lava, which controls how fast it flows. These data must include the temperature range, crystallinity, and bubble content during eruptions. The UTSA HAMsTER lab recently developed a technique to measure the viscosity of erupting lava, including bubbles and crystals. However, the range of bubble and crystal contents that can be measured with this technique needs to be investigated. Lava will be collected from 4 different eruptions of Mauna Loa, and then used as starting materials for the experiments. The data will lead to better modeling of volcanic processes and lava flow hazards. These improvements will also apply to other volcanoes in the US and elsewhere. The project will support an Air Force veteran for the first two years of his PhD. Lab members will explain and demonstrate volcanoes to K-12 schools in San Antonio.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to explore the capabilities of a new technique for measuring the rheology of three-phase basaltic lava (liquid + crystals + bubbles). This technique uses a high-temperature rotational concentric cylinder rheometer, with short heating and measurement times that enable retention of original crystal textures including olivine phenocrysts, and pyroxene and plagioclase microlites. The mineralogy and CSD's of previous rheology techniques applied to basaltic lava have never adequately reproduced those found in field samples. Preliminary experiments using the new technique on lava from K?lauea have crystal size and shape distributions that are indistinguishable from samples collected in the field. These samples had much lower viscosities (by up to an order of magnitude!) than would be predicted using current rheology models that are used in lava flow modeling. Starting materials for new experiments will be lavas from Mauna Loa, including very high high crystal and bubble contents.

Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies the geometric shape of objects defined by polynomial equations. Often, the shape of these objects, called algebraic varieties, reflects the complexity of the defining equations and vice-versa. For instance, from the defining equations, we can understand if the algebraic variety has singularities, i.e., whether the geometric object has sharp points at which the curvature changes abruptly. These points are known as algebraic singularities. This project aims to develop new tools to understand algebraic singularities and apply these techniques to understand algebraic varieties of positive curvature.  As part of the broader impacts of this project, the PI will run online research seminars for graduate students related to the proposed research. The PI will initiate a summer reading program in algebraic geometry for undergraduates. The educational component of this project includes training in algebraic geometry for graduate students. Two summer research schools will be hosted at UCLA by the PI and experts in the field to train the new generation of mathematicians in birational geometry.<br/><br/>Fano varieties are considered one of the three building blocks of projective varieties. There has been a lot of progress towards understanding the geometry of Fano varieties in the last few decades. Nevertheless, the understanding of log terminal singularities (the local analog of Fano varieties) is far from being satisfactory. Complexity is an invariant that allows us to understand how far a Fano variety or a log terminal singularity is from being toric, i.e., defined by binomial equations. In this project, the PI will develop techniques to understand Fano varieties and log terminal singularities of small complexity, for instance, complexity zero, one, and two. There are two guiding principles: understanding the connection between the complexity and minimal log discrepancies (in the local setting) and understanding the connection between the complexity and anti-pluricanonical systems of Fano varieties (in the global setting).

These materials are distinguished in having properties that remain unchanged when the material is reshaped or disturbed. Topological materials have robust, i.e. impervious to material imperfections or shape, metallic conduction on their surfaces and interfaces that hold promise for device applications. Recent theoretical work has revealed that topological materials are ubiquitous in nature. However, the analytic tools for efficiently identifying and classifying topological materials are applicable to only about half of the crystal arrangements of constituent atoms that occur in nature, and only in materials where electrons do not interact strongly. A unifying framework for understanding how these analytical tools relate to measurable properties of materials is also lacking.<br/><br/>This project will focus on addressing this issue by exploiting mathematical connections between topology and symmetry as they apply in materials.

The discovery of topological materials has revolutionized condensed matter physics, and has promised transformative breakthroughs due to their robust transport properties, edge states, and exotic quasiparticle excitations. Developments over the past several years have shown that topological materials are ubiquitous in nature. The theory of topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators has given researchers new tools to quickly screen for nontrivial topology in weakly-correlated materials, based on the symmetry properties of electronic wavefunctions in momentum space. In spite of this tremendous progress, there are two major outstanding hurdles before the promise of harnessing topological effects can be realized: Symmetry indicators are not applicable to approximately half of the known crystal symmetry types, and a unifying framework connecting symmetry indicator invariants to experimental observables is not known. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will address these issues by: 1) Studying the hydrodynamics of topological crystalline insulators and their response to defects to identify observable consequences of nontrivial topology beyond the bulk boundary correspondence. Both hydrodynamic response and the response of the bulk and boundary to defects will be investigated; 2) Developing group-theoretic techniques to define extended symmetry indicators for topological insulators and superconductors applicable to chiral materials. Attention will be paid to incorporating internal symmetries such as sublattice and particle hole symmetries with spatial symmetries in a consistent framework. Additionally, the action of spatial symmetries on electron spin will be explored as an indicator of topology.<br/><br/>In addition to the research, this project supports the training and mentorship of graduate students and their preparation to join the nation's quantum workforce, as well as improved access to physics education and research. This project is expected to result in the development of software tools and databases to aid in the discovery of new topological materials, which will be made available to the wider physics and materials science communities.

People think of evolution occurring in geological time, with eras like the Dinosaur Age populated with different organisms from what we have on Earth today. Most studies of evolution, however, look at changes that occur in days or years in organisms that are all around us today. Scientists are realizing that rapid evolution is common and affects all organisms. For example, many agricultural pests in the USA are controlled by predators that attack and kill them, making insecticides unnecessary. Pea aphids represent a great example of this, because they are kept in check by predators. However, pea aphids can evolve resistance to predators. This rapid evolution raises the risk of greater crop damage. Despite their ability to evolve resistance, all the pea aphids do not become resistance to predators. There are also some that remain susceptible, creating a balance between resistance and susceptibility. This project aims to uncover how this balance is maintained, and how agricultural management practices can reduce the risks of agricultural pests becoming resistant. Understanding this balance will help to develop strategies to make US agriculture more resilient and increase the security and sustainability of our bioeconomy. The project will also provide hands-on research experiences to students with no prior experience. Public outreach events will engage farmers to share the results of the research broadly.<br/><br/>The research investigates the ecological-evolutionary dynamics of pea aphids and their parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. Aphidius ervi was deliberately introduced to North America as a biocontrol agent of pea aphids, particularly to control pea aphids as pests of alfalfa crops. Pea aphids are a leading model for investigating the evolutionary and ecological consequences of symbiosis because all populations harbor heritable symbionts that provide well-documented benefits. The most common and best studied facultative symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, confers resistance against A. ervi. Although evolutionary theory predicts that resistance traits will often be bimodal (either susceptible or highly resistant), pea aphids exhibit a full spectrum of resistance through different symbiont variants. Although the prevalences of different symbiont variants fluctuate (reflecting the intensity of parasitism and selection), the collective of symbionts across the spectrum of resistance appears to be stable. Furthermore, the ecological interactions between pea aphids and A. ervi are stable, in the sense that A. ervi is always present but abundances never get high enough to extirpate pea aphids. This ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions may itself be the product of the evolutionary stability of the symbionts that confer pea aphid resistance to A. ervi. The research will use field experiments, lab experiments and mathematical modeling to examine both the evolutionary and ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions, and whether this stability is generated by the interconnections between evolutionary and ecological dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Market failures prevent resources, such as labor and capital, from being used in the places where they are most valuable. While it is known that market failures are a feature of all economies and contribute to income differences across countries, the question of which types of households are affected most by these market failures is much less researched. This project makes progress on this gap by developing tools to connect and analyze multiple datasets that provide an extensive set of links in the economy between households and firms, between both households and firms and the government, and between the firms themselves. Understanding which groups benefit and which groups lose out from policies that address such market failures is vital to the design of approaches that maximize the welfare of any nation. The research outcomes could be essential for researchers and decisionmakers in shaping optimal U.S. policies and potentially enhancing the wellbeing of households and businesses.  <br/><br/>This award funds a research project that develops tools to estimate distortions?markups, markdowns, and taxes that prevents resources being allocated to their best uses?at a highly disaggregated level and trace them to individuals through arbitrary trade, employment, and financial networks. This methodology is applied to administrative data, where the research team can map out the flow of goods and money for the entire economy by linking firm-to-firm networks with firm-to-consumer, firm-to-lender, and firm-to-employee networks alongside ownership registries. These methods reveal how the burden of distortions is shared among households belonging to different regions, demographic groups, skill groups, and income levels. In addition, they enable answers to various questions, such as which distortions do the most to compress and expand the distribution of living standards; what trade-offs are observed in approaches designed to improve the impacts of distortions; and to what degree overlapping distortions necessitate our wide-ranging analysis as opposed to focusing on one specific distortion or sector at a time. The theory and methods are developed in a way that they can be applied to any country with similar data. This project advances knowledge in several ways. First, it operationalizes recent theoretical work on general equilibrium models of heterogeneous agents in distorted economic environments. Second, by assembling a complete empirical mapping of economic relationships between agents in an economy, it measures the distributional impact of the main distortions that are present in an economy (those on labor, capital, output, and intermediate inputs) throughout all sectors. This is relevant because studying the impact of reducing distortions in one specific market is influenced by distortions in other markets. Thus, to fully assess the trade-offs of reducing distortions, one needs to go beyond specific distortions and specific sectors. The results have the potential to significantly reshape how economists perceive the implications of market distortions and the policies responding to them. By addressing who bears the costs and who benefits from market distortions, a key theme for decisionmakers, the findings of this research could lead to optimal policies related to market failures and enhance the welfare of the U.S. population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Post-mortem execution analysis involves inspecting an execution's artifacts, a collection of states gathered during the execution (e.g., a software log, memory core dump, etc.). The work's key innovation lies in exploiting relationships across different types of execution artifacts to treat them as complements rather than alternatives. The work will pursue three synergistic thrusts: First, it will develop a technique that increases the efficiency of post-mortem execution analyses over ""high-fidelity"" artifacts (i.e., those containing all of an execution's states) by embedding them as ""low-fidelity"" artifacts (i.e., those containing a sparse subset of an execution's states). Second, the work will improve the effectiveness of analyses over low-fidelity artifacts by extrapolating a low-fidelity artifact into a set of high-fidelity artifacts that could have produced it. The work will support probabilistic analyses over the resulting set. Finally, the work will develop a technique for balancing efficiency and effectiveness by automatically navigating the space of execution artifacts that a given application could produce.<br/><br/>The project will enable developers to resolve challenging software issues more quickly, which is increasingly important as society relies upon software in our modern lives. For example, society embeds software into transportation, medicine, finance, and basic human interactions (e.g., dating). In turn, resolving software issues more quickly can save money, limit disruptions, help people find love, and, in some cases, save lives. In addition, the proposed systems and techniques will serve as useful pedagogical tools for teaching students about complex systems and the process of debugging them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research indicates that innovative activity in science is slowing. The causes behind this decline are unknown. Addressing this issue is hindered by our limited ability to empirically test how individual scientists make breakthrough discoveries. The researchers draw on the interdisciplinary expertise of a team with deep knowledge in sociology, agent-based modeling, and philosophy of science. By combining both theoretical and empirical studies, this award helps science to further understand the causes of, and solutions to, our declining rate of innovation. By providing a deeper understanding of the factors that drive or hinder innovation, the award informs policies aimed at fostering a more conducive environment for scientific breakthroughs. <br/><br/>The supported research uses a novel mixed-method approach, where empirically informed agent-based simulation models are combined with empirical analysis of the scientific record. This allows for a comparison of both internal factors---those related to the structure and dynamics of scientific content---and external factors that operate outside and influence the body of scientific knowledge. Internal factors involve the proliferation of scientific knowledge, while external factors encompass funding incentives, pressure to publish, and the challenges of remote collaboration. To increase innovation, it is essential to implement actionable policies that mitigate these factors and guide scientists in their contributions to scientific knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential for snowmelt is dependent on the availability of snow and the occurrence of specific weather patterns that trigger melting. By assessing the weather patterns suitable for snowmelt, further insights can be gained into how and why rapid snowmelt occurs and what impacts can follow. Particularly in the eastern and central United States, the snowpack typically completely melts and re-accumulates multiple times per season, where the variable release of water from the snowpack can pose challenges to predicting and preparing for large and rapid events. Using historical archives of snow and meteorological data, this research aims to evaluate the physical characteristics of weather patterns that result in rapid snowmelt and assess how variations in weather conditions have contributed to variability in snowmelt in the recent past. The investigator will then assess future projections of snowmelt conditions and associated weather patterns using a suite of numerical models under multiple future scenarios. Through this project?s research and educational objectives, over 20 students per year will be actively involved in research efforts.<br/><br/>An improved understanding of the processes leading to snowmelt, the role of atmospheric circulation on regional energy balances, and the projected variability of future snowmelt conditions will better inform water resource and risk managers of potential outcomes. Such information allows for appropriate infrastructure and hazard mitigation plans to be determined for impactful snowmelt events. Synergies between research and educational objectives will further allow for the creation and dissemination of a variety of Open Educational Resources for university students that will advance STEM education beyond the investigator?s institution and facilitate the testing of additional underexplored hypotheses by students. The investigator will transform existing coursework in hydroclimatology into a service-learning pedagogical framework, where students, the investigator, and external partners collaborate to engage in developing novel, community-responsive research.

They play a major role in decomposing up to 60% of plant litter and fallen wood in these areas. During this process, termites rely on a partnership with microorganisms in their guts to help break down organic matter. In the process, some termites can also produce substantial amounts of methane that can be released into the atmosphere. There is still much uncertainty about how much methane termites release worldwide due to a lack of understanding of the processes that determine termite methane production and emission. The goals of this project are to understand the differences in methane production rate across termite species and how that relates to the microorganisms in their guts, and to estimate total methane emissions from termites across large areas using field measurements and remote sensing data. The fieldwork focuses on termites in the tropical savannas and forests of Odzala-Kokoua National Park, home to an exceptionally wide variety of termite species. The results from this project could greatly improve understanding of how much methane termites produce and how it happens, from individual species to whole colonies and larger areas, helping to fill important gaps in knowledge of termites' role in contributing to atmospheric methane. The project will train early-career scientists and engage K-12 students and the public through field, education, and museum programs in the United States and beyond, enhancing public understanding of insect ecology and their impact on the environment.<br/><br/>Researchers will conduct field surveys to assess termite populations across tropical savannas and forests in Odzala-Kokoua National Park. An incubation method will measure methane production rates across termite species, considering variations in castes, nesting behaviors, and feeding groups, followed by DNA isolation and sequencing to characterize the methanogen community in termite symbiotic systems. A mass balance approach will determine the oxidation rates of termite-produced methane across different colonies, while laboratory incubations and metagenomic analyses will assess methanotrophic activities and communities within the colonies. Field measurements of colony-level methane emissions will be integrated with high-resolution, drone-based, LiDAR remote sensing to develop algorithms for upscaling termite methane emissions to landscape scales. The data collected will be used to address: 1) How do methane production rates vary across termite species, and what are the underlying mechanisms for these variations? 2) What are the oxidation rates of termite-produced methane within colonies and surrounding soils, and what are the mechanisms driving these processes? 3) How much methane is emitted by termites across tropical savanna and forest landscapes? This project has the potential to transform knowledge of the rates and underlying processes of termite methane production and emissions, from individual species to colonies to landscapes, filling crucial knowledge gaps and advancing understanding of this overlooked yet important contribution of termites to global atmospheric methane cycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This difficulty may come from not having enough detailed information about daily relationship experiences. With modern technology, like smartphones, people now track many parts of their daily lives, such as diet, exercise, and mood. This project uses similar technology to better understand romantic relationships by observing how they change day by day. It applies techniques like those used to forecast the weather or stock market trends to identify relationship patterns. These patterns help scientists learn about the different ways that relationships ebb and flow in daily life and predict which relationships are likely to last and which may not. <br/><br/>This project seeks to transform the basic scientific understanding of romantic relationship quality. It uses innovative intensive longitudinal methods with large, heterogeneous samples of individuals and couples in romantic relationship to (1) examine dynamic patterns of change in relationship quality over time and (2) identify whether some relationship patterns are more adaptive than others. For instance, patterns involving quick recovery from negative experiences might be more adaptive than those involving slow recovery. Tracking day-to-day relationship changes over long periods allows for discovery of common patterns that emerge before a relationship ends, improving predictions of relationship outcomes. In addition, examining how partners change with, view, and affect each other adds an important dyadic component to prediction models, filling a key gap in our scientific knowledge. The development and sharing of innovative statistical methods for analyzing dynamic social processes provides valuable resources for the scientific community. Broad dissemination of study findings, including through an interactive website, ensures that the findings are shared broadly. Ultimately, this project expands our knowledge of relationship science by encouraging us to view relationships in a novel way - as potentially meaningful dynamic patterns of change which informs future research and interventions aimed at promoting healthy, lasting relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimization algorithms empower most of the data science and machine learning technologies currently used for decision-making in several sectors, such as healthcare, energy, transportation, manufacturing, and finance. Despite its widespread adoption, there are still significant gaps between theory and practice in optimization. In some sectors, simple heuristics, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, yield incredibly effective results while lacking basic theoretical guarantees. Meanwhile, other sectors rely on traditional algorithms, e.g., interior point methods, that have strong guarantees but struggle to scale to contemporary problem sizes. The goal of this project is to advance the state of the art of optimization theory and algorithms to tackle the unique challenges posed by modern data science problems. This award integrates research efforts with activities that broaden STEM participation and expand educational opportunities; these include mentoring high school students through the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Outreach, advising diverse group of graduate students, developing novel courses on the practice and theory of data science, and disseminating methods via open-source software to encourage broad adoption.<br/><br/>To achieve its research goal, this CAREER award will develop novel tools to analyze the computational and statistical complexity of off-the-shelf heuristics that perform well even in nonconvex, nonsmooth settings. Capitalizing on these insights, the project will design new algorithmic solutions that circumvent the computational pitfalls of traditional methods. The guiding principle to tackle these challenges will be structure. On the one hand, although nonconvex, nonsmooth problems appearing in applications are known to be NP-hard, this notion only captures worst-case complexity. In practice, many problems enjoy additional benign geometric structure, enabling simple heuristics to succeed. On the other hand, this project will leverage the inherent structure of problems to design faster, parallelizable algorithms that can fully utilize modern machine learning infrastructure. These algorithms will be evaluated on optimization formulations from various applications spanning X-ray crystallography, phase space tomography, and recommendation systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical reactions of accessible sites on a protein with specific labels followed by the use of MS to identify the areas that were labeled helps illuminate protein conformation. Dr. Lindert will perform molecular dynamics simulations to understand how labeling reagents interact with proteins and whether they might induce unwanted conformational changes. Additionally, a web server will be developed to identify the optimal covalent labeling reagents for a given protein sequence. These studies are designed to improve MS covalent labeling measurements, and in this way lead to a better understanding of protein conformation, with potentially broad long term scientific impact in protein conformational/folding studies. If successful, these studies will support work with minimally invasive covalent labeling reagents and support the design of new labeling reagents that do not distort the probed structure.  <br/><br/>The performance and utility of MS covalent labeling measurements would be greatly improved by a better understanding of how covalent labeling reagents interact with proteins and through a systematic understanding of which labels are most suited for a particular protein under investigation. To address these needs, continued computational work that advances covalent labeling measurement science is required. Dr. Lindert?s research is expected to further improve covalent labeling measurements by addressing these current limitations. MD simulations will be used to develop better models of how different covalent labels interact with proteins. The interaction of several commonly used covalent labels with proteins in solution will be simulated before and after covalent attachment, and the Lindert group will explore if and potentially how certain labels distort protein structure or dynamics. Knowledge gained from these simulations has the potential to elevate understanding of covalent labeling measurements. The protein sequence defines possible structural conformations, illuminating which residues may be optimal for labeling in structure determination studies. Subsequently, a web server will be developed to identify the optimal covalent labeling reagents for a given protein sequence. The projected development of this web server stands to benefit the entire protein covalent-labeling community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Southwestern U.S., for example, weedy grasses can fill gaps between native cacti, significantly increasing fire fuel availability, leading to bigger fires. To reduce impacts of this weed-fire connection scientists have traditionally focused on the planting of native plant species. Focusing on plants alone, however, might be misplaced. Important processes that affect fire behavior might occur below ground, in the soil, and may play a crucial role in post-fire habitat recovery. This project will study the bacteria and viruses (microbes) and the different types of organic matter in soil to better understand the relationship between weedy plants and wildfire. Once the researchers understand these soil processes, they will design inocula that contain soil and plant seeds that promote recovery in damaged areas. Combining the right belowground (soil) and aboveground (seeds) ingredients, the researchers hope to create an environment where soil microoganisms promote growth of native plants, which in turn provide nutrients back to the soil that promote growth of beneficial microbes. The project will publicize its results to land managers via workshops, extension publications, and the EcoRestore digital portal. In addition, high school students participating in a free outdoor science program will collect data, identify plants and maintain experimental plots.<br/><br/>With increasing temperature, drought severity and fire frequency, western US forests have the potential to transform from net sinks to net sources of CO2.

Plastics are ubiquitous in all aspects of modern life, including food packaging, clothing, health care, and household products.  Plastics production has increased substantially over past decades, and serious attention is now paid to managing plastic wastes, especially recycling and reuse. It has not been feasible, either technically or economically, to achieve a fully circular system. Plastic materials that are not processed for reuse end up in landfills or in other waste processing systems (e.g., incineration) or advanced recycling facilities (e.g., pyrolysis) or are directly disposed of in the environment. In the environment, Micro-Nano-Plastics (MNP) may be generated through incomplete decomposition of the materials. These MNP enter the air, soil, and water environments where plants, animals, and humans may be exposed. The widespread, global use of plastics, including in ocean environments, concerns the public and the research community. There have been reports of MNP being found in drinking water supplies of major cities, as well as in human blood and tissue, raising concerns over potential public health risks. This award will help support scientists and engineers to participate in a conference on ""Micro-Nano Plastics in Water: Characterization, Cure and Prevention,"" which will be held in Davos, Switzerland on July 5-11, 2025. The conference will engage in a multi-faceted exploration of the MNP issue, with an emphasis on finding reasonable solutions.<br/><br/>Conference topics will include history and evolution of the MNP problem, governmental and legislative initiatives, characterization of environmental and human health related MNP, analytical methods of MNP detection, scientific and technological advancements to cure the problem (e.g. source reduction, water/wastewater treatment, recycle), prevention (e.g., packaging changes, material substitutions), circular economy, life cycle analysis of MNP, and global modeling. The full scope of the MNP issue will be addressed, that is: characterization of MNP, cures to mitigate human health and environmental impacts, and preventive strategies going forward. Achieving a circular economy for plastics is being analyzed and debated on the global stage, but it is evident that MNP are widespread in the environment and mitigation of potential risks is a public health priority. The conference will bring together attendees from academia, government research institutes, startups, multinationals, regulatory agencies, financial institutions, and representatives from the plastics industry, highlighting the extensive and interdisciplinary nature of the topic. Collaborations between researchers in academia and relevant partners will be facilitated, as well as how the outcomes can be shared with the broader public. Funding from NSF will be used to support conference attendance of up to 25 U.S.-based graduate students, post-docs, and early career faculty members to ensure that the newest entrants in the field are welcomed into the community. NSF funds will be used only for U.S.-based participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soft particles suspended in fluids are abundant in the food industry, pharmaceuticals, blood flow, and microbial ecosystems in the natural environment. The investigators will use microscopy to quantify the flow, transport, and clogging of soft particles of prescribed sizes within porous environments fabricated using a microfluidic 3D printer. These studies will reveal how particle elasticity and deformability, in conjunction with the structure of the porous medium, influence the transition from a flowing suspension of particles to a clogged state. The project will enhance student participation in career-building activities by integrating experimental skills and teamwork into freshman physics courses. Additionally, it will provide opportunities for community building and improve the retention of students through collaborative projects and teamwork.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This research will establish a fundamental understanding of the cooperative dynamics of deformable granular particles in porous media. It will investigate how microscale particle interactions, elasticity, and pore network connectivity influence macro-scale transport by integrating microscopic measurements and bulk permeability analysis. Two fundamental questions will be addressed: (1) How does the network of pores in a medium determine the formation of particle clusters within individual pores and enhance the long-range spatial order within clusters? (2) What is the microscopic origin of the increased apparent viscosity of a suspension of particles flowing through a porous medium at small shear stress? By connecting particle elasticity, cluster formation, and porous medium properties, this study will identify the regimes in which either single-particle properties or collective transport dominate, leading to new insights into clogging and material transport in biological and industrial applications. Results from this project will advance the physics of phase transition in a porous structure by quantifying the spatial correlation of particles within the medium. More broadly, this research will provide a foundation for developing models for anomalous shear thickening and jamming transitions based on the local dynamics of particles, applicable to various nonequilibrium systems confined to a rigid matrix.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current VR systems often rely on sight and sound, leaving out how hot or cold a surface or object feels, limiting the ability to simulate real-world settings. This research takes a new approach called ?thermal masking? to create a feeling of hot or cold at precise places on the body without having large, high-power devices. This research will make VR systems easier to use, lower power, and more practical for application areas such as education, training, and entertainment. This project will advance science and technology by making VR more realistic and user-friendly. It will enhance national prosperity and welfare by making new and better tools for learning, training, and interactive experiences.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the project will address critical challenges in the design of VR systems by developing innovative thermal user interfaces that integrate thermal and tactile feedback. The research focuses on three objectives. The first objective is to understand the interplay of temperature and touch sensations to create realistic thermal illusions through thermal masking. The second objective is to advance rendering techniques to generate dynamic and continuous temperature changes in two-dimensional space.  The third objective is to optimize actuator placement and system design to balance energy efficiency, performance, and usability. These activities will leverage thermal-tactile integration to achieve precise temperature feedback while minimizing bulk and power requirements. The project will employ experiments to map the spatial and temporal dynamics of thermal masking, develop algorithms for rendering thermal patterns, and validate the interfaces in VR applications. The outcomes are expected to improve a user?s sense of immersion, simplify the engineering of multisensory VR systems, and enable a broader range of applications and interactions in virtual environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, the project addresses the national interest by improving public understanding of climate risks, fostering more informed decision-making, and promoting inclusive, effective adaptation strategies. The project also advances broader societal goals by training undergraduate researchers, partnering with nonprofit organizations to develop practical outreach methods, and creating software tools that can be used to study belief systems in various contexts.<br/><br/>This project develops a new conceptual framework, new methodological tools, and survey-based measurement approach for ?belief networks,? capturing how an individual?s attitudes about topics such as climate, people migration, and social fairness simultaneously influence one another.

The researchers will then design and implement scientific communication experiments to examine how information targeting specific attitudes?and the links among them?affects people?s adaptive capacity and motivation. Alongside these empirical studies, the project supports new network science methods to analyze individual-level belief systems at scale, providing computational and statistical tools for extracting, modeling, and comparing complex attitude linkages.

Computational models are highly influential across the behavioral sciences. Many complex models, however, are beyond the reach of traditional statistical methods or demand unreasonably high computational costs. This project provides researchers with a widely applicable framework for efficient Bayesian inference. The framework enables researchers across the social and behavioral sciences to quickly develop, fit, criticize, and adapt complex mechanistic models, overcoming the constraints imposed by traditional statistical methods. Furthermore, the project makes important contributions to open science and reproducibility by providing a freely accessible and transparent interface for researchers to benchmark Bayesian methods systematically and communicate results. Finally, the project supports and trains junior researchers who will drive key methodological developments.<br/><br/>This research upscales Bayesian methods by building on recent progress in amortized Bayesian inference (ABI). ABI repays users with instant inference of latent parameters following a lengthier training phase that relies on model simulations as training data.

Typically, engineers rely on their knowledge to make assumptions under which the system can guarantee a certain level of performance and safety. However, with black-box learning and increasingly large high-dimensional data, human engineers struggle to understand and formalize these assumptions, which severely limits the effectiveness of validation and monitoring. As a result, CPS systems end up susceptible to rare events, distribution shifts, and other unexpected circumstances ? and are not equipped to respond to these intelligently and safely. This project aims to transform the management of assumptions in learning-enabled CPS by making novel fundamental connections between formal methods, machine learning, and decision-making.

To make these assumptions explicit and actionable, this project will build the mathematical and algorithmic foundation for assumption awareness via specifying, validating, and responding to assumptions behind the closed-loop CPS guarantees. To this end, this project will create an engineering methodology in three sequential thrusts: (1) discovering and representing relevant assumptions of learning-enabled CPS, (2) performing end-to-end validation of these assumptions across offline and online settings, and (3) enhancing decision-making and control to recover from online violations of these assumptions.

Empirical Bayes offers a method to enhance individual question inference by sharing information, potentially improving statistical accuracy. However, it relies on strong modeling assumptions, limiting its applicability. This research aims to make empirical Bayes more powerful and accessible by integrating it with modern machine learning and causal inference, demonstrating its effectiveness under fewer assumptions, and developing methods to assess uncertainty more effectively.

As a result, these microbes are important for their host?s growth and survival. However, these microbes do not provide a free lunch: the host pays for microbial nutrients by providing resources like sugar back to the microbes. This project will test whether this cost also affects the host?s ability to defend itself. The researchers will address this question in legume plants. Legumes rely on a beneficial microbe for an essential nutrient (nitrogen), which they pay for with sugar. The researchers will test how this beneficial microbe affects the evolution of leaf defensive hairs, an important plant defense. These hairs prevent insects from eating the plant. If beneficial microbes affect leaf defensive hairs, then it means that they can influence whether their host will be able to evolve resistance to natural enemies like insects. This project will also train undergraduates in the fundamentals of field biology. The training will include teaching the next generation of field biologists to develop hypotheses, design experiments to test them, and analyze data. The overarching goal is to lower the barrier of entry to field biology for young scientists. <br/><br/>This project will test the hypotheses that microbial symbionts affect defense trait evolution in their hosts, and that this effect is mediated by the resources that they provide and consume. The proposed work will close the existing gap between the hypothesized and realized contributions of microbial symbionts to host trait evolution by (1) determining how heritable variation in host traits arises from genetic variation in symbiont populations; (2) linking symbiont effects on host defense traits to the host resources they provide and consume; and (3) directly testing whether microbial symbionts contribute to host trait evolution in the wild. The resource-exchange mutualism between the legume Medicago lupulina and nitrogen-fixing Ensifer bacteria will be used to test these hypotheses. This proposal represents a novel integration of microbial symbioses into the evolutionary ecology of defense via the overlapping resource physiologies of symbiosis and defense.

A key problem in this area is understanding how environmental change affects the way that species obtain food. Rising ocean temperatures may increase the food requirements of predatory animals which can cause prey populations to decline. Alternatively, warming can cause multiple predators to compete and interfere with each other, reducing effects on prey. This CAREER project addresses this problem by focusing on abundant native and invasive predatory crabs and their consumption of prey blue mussels in the Gulf of Maine, which is among the fastest warming habitats on the planet. This project measures how temperature affects the physiology of the focal species and how they interact with each other using a series of laboratory experiments, then uses mathematical models to calculate the impacts of temperature on the relative abundance of predators and prey. The educational components of this project include the formation of two working groups that pair early career scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) with middle and late career mentors to train on team-based approaches to science. The investigator is developing data science workshops and laboratory modules to enhance undergraduate education. Results of this research inform the management of marine resources such as shellfish and broadly contribute to our understanding of how marine life will respond to changing ocean conditions. <br/><br/>Predicting the ecological consequences of changing environmental conditions will require an understanding of how temperature affects species interactions such as predation and competition. Further complicating this endeavor is the fact that communities in nature are often composed of multiple interacting predators that can produce non-linear and complex effects on prey species and overall community composition. This project 1) uses an integrated approach, combining single species physiological assays to compare the relative thermal performance of multiple predatory marine invertebrates (native and invasive) and prey blue mussels from the Gulf of Maine; 2) measures species interactions within the community using mesocosm experiments, quantifying temperature dependent predation, intraguild predation, and competition; and then 3) uses this information to construct numerical models to predict the effects of temperature on the biomass dynamics of both predators and prey.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These waves can accelerate electrons to high energies, generating the Van Allen radiation belts, which pose a hazard to spacecraft and humans in space.  Waves can also drive particle precipitation into the atmosphere, modifying ozone and atmospheric chemistry and generating dazzling auroral displays.

With the growth of the Heliophysics System Observatory and multi-spacecraft missions, we can now piece together a more complete picture of the three-dimensional dynamics of the complex magnetospheric system.  The proposal will utilize multipoint measurements to study the drivers, structure, and effects of waves in Earth's magnetosphere.  The team will analyze multi-mission wave data from the Heliophysics System Observatory to characterize the fine and larger scale properties of various wave modes, looking at overall spatial extents and spatial scales of modulation and wave property evolution.  As evidenced by upcoming Heliophysics missions and mission concepts, constellation missions have become the future of magnetospheric science, and with the continuing development of small spacecraft and CubeSats, these multipoint measurements are now more easily obtainable.

A long literature evaluates their effectiveness, and the U.S. Congress requires periodic review for reauthorization, yet critical elements of program design have been left out of quantitative evaluations and recipients acknowledge several potential design flaws. One overlooked element is the role of timing between SBIR/STTR grant rounds and specifically the impact of long waits between SBIR/STTR funding tranches. Advancing understanding around the role of timing could significantly improve program success and technology outcomes, furthering national technology and SBA priorities.<br/><br/>This research evaluates the impact of accelerated government R&D funding for small technology business. The research uses data on federal R&D funding awards, data on commercialization, finance, and procurement outcomes, empirical modeling, and interviews. The project identifies policy levers for enhancing public programs that finance innovation, and explores the comparative advantage of such programs for some scientists and firms versus others, with particular attention to those innovators who have been overlooked and under-funded. The researchers examine 1) impacts of gaps in waiting time between government R&D funding tranches 2) the impacts on key firms that have been identified as priorities for support.

Today, there are an estimated 60 million horses under human management globally, and in the United States, the horse industry provides jobs for more than 4 million people. Each year, an estimated 27 million Americans ride horses, and 2 million own horses. Although primarily valued for transportation, leisure, and sport today, the earliest domesticated horses played a critical role in the prehistoric development and spread of pastoralism. Horses increased food availability both by enabling the management of larger livestock herds and by directly contributing to human nutrition through milk production. The origins of horse milking are poorly understood, but horse dairy products like koumiss have been a core food tradition in grasslands for thousands of years. The goal of this collaborative and multidisciplinary project is to answer fundamental questions about the origins of horse husbandry and the early economic role of horse dairying in ancient pastoralist societies. Archaeological investigations of early horse management and milking clarify the development of Bronze and Iron Age horse husbandry, which laid the foundation for the rise of historic horse-focused empires and the growth of today?s global livestock economies. By bringing together an international team of archaeologists, chemists, cultural heritage managers, and commercial dairy producers, this project creates new collaborations and business opportunities between academic institutions and the food industry, builds stronger training networks for graduate students in food science and analytical chemistry, and contributes to greater public understanding of the history and science of dairying through cultural events, STEM-based outreach programs, and a museum exhibition.<br/><br/>The investigators apply cutting-edge analysis of proteins in ancient human dental calculus (tooth tartar) using mass spectrometry to understand the emergence of horse milk consumption and its rise as a vibrant food tradition.

As a result, continental interiors contain many dormant fault zones that represent locations where crustal blocks came together. These ancient fault zones are sites of weakness that can become reactivated to generate mountain ranges in the middle of the continents if the tectonic plate motions are appropriate and the ancient fault is sufficiently weak. However, it remains unclear which plate tectonic scenarios favor fault reactivation, leading to the unsatisfying observation that some ancient fault systems get reactivated by later tectonic events and others do not. This project will study uplift of the Black Hills, South Dakota, because it is an isolated mountain range near the middle of the North American continent that is focused on an ancient fault zone related to growth of the North American continent. To develop an understanding of ancient fault reactivation, this project will study the ancient faults exposed in the Black Hills to determine how those faults formed and evolved throughout the tectonic evolution of North America. The project will target specific sites in the Black Hills and use the chemistry of the rocks to determine their ages. This history of fault motion and rock ages from the Black Hills will be used together to determine: 1) when uplift of the Black Hills began and what tectonics processes were responsible; and 2) whether the faults that uplifted the Black Hills formed at the time of uplift, are older faults inherited from assembly of the North American continent, or both. The project will involve a high school from the Rapid City, SD region, and undergraduate and graduate students from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, who will receive training on how to perform geologic field work and help collect the data related to the project goals. The project PI will also generate and contribute field trip curriculum to high schools in the Black Hills region. Collectively, the project will contribute a better understanding of how plate tectonics works within continents, which will provide an explanation of why some continents have isolated mountain ranges hundreds of kilometers from the coastlines where active plate boundaries typically reside.<br/><br/>The general view of ?strong? cratons characterized by stable Precambrian basement is challenged by observations of Precambrian basement exhumed in the cores of geologically recent orogenic belts. Rather, intracontinental deformation that exposes Precambrian rocks provides a record of the evolving strength of continental interiors relative to the forces acting on continental margins and allows for an evaluation of how inherited deformation features in the Precambrian basement may influence, or not, the rejuvenated orogen. The Laramide orogeny of western North America is an example of a geologically recent orogenic belt that exhumed Precambrian basement but has an unclear relationship to the Precambrian structures that it spatially overlaps. This project will use the Black Hills of western South Dakota to test the hypothesis that the geologic evolution of inherited structures within a Precambrian suture zone facilitated strain partitioning of pure shear and simple shear components of Laramide deformation. Determining the relationship between Precambrian and Laramide structures in the Black Hills will require modern structural analysis of both Laramide and Precambrian structures, and low-temperature thermochronometry and U-Pb geochronology on exhumed Precambrian metamorphic rocks to place better time brackets on deformation phases. Outcomes from this research will reveal the prominent sites and style of structural reactivation in the Black Hills, leading to a mechanistic understanding of intracontinental deformation as recorded by the Black Hills. Outcomes of the project will contribute to modern research objectives of the Tectonics community, including constraining the factors that influence the mechanical behavior of the lithosphere, understanding the evolution of lithospheric scale fault systems, and developing a skilled geoscience workforce. The education plan associated with the research project will involve high school and university students in field work/education and develop field trip curriculum and training for dissemination to high school faculty. These activities will strengthen the relationship between local high schools and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (the host university), leading to increased student interest (and expectantly enrollment) in geoscience at the university level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as a stigmatized, resource-lacking population, IRRIs are at risk of experiencing unique and highly challenging stressors in their job search and employment, as well as to respond to the resulting strain in maladaptive ways (e.g., substance use), thus potentially increasing the odds of recidivism. To address these risks and enhance the odds of reentry success, there is a need to better understand the challenges experienced by IRRIs as they seek gainful employment. Accordingly, the project team is conducting interviews with IRRIs at various stages of their reentry, as well as with those working with them (e.g., halfway house directors and counselors), to explore the unique aspects of IRRI job search and employment. Informed by these interviews, the project team also aims to test how a combination of different job search tactics, individual background factors, and situational factors may combine to explain job search and employment outcomes.

However, in practice, the large number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, far exceeds even the best computing resources. To answer questions of interest, one needs a simpler effective description that is a good approximation. Following the prescriptions of statistical mechanics, much effort over the years has been devoted to achieving a reduction in complexity through a point of view focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. A first approximation, known as the mean-field limit, effectively captures the ?typical behavior? of a particle in the system through a solution of a single equation, which is much simpler than the equations governing the exact motion of all the individual particles. However, our understanding of the mean-field limit over the timescales relevant for the system?s relaxation to equilibrium is quite poor. Additionally, the mean-field description ignores correlations between particles, created by their interactions and the thermal effects of the particles? environment, which capture the disorder of the system. Little is known about this disorder, which is encoded in the probability of deviations from the mean-field limit. The distribution of these deviations is the next-order approximation beyond the mean-field. The project will advance our understanding of how the system disorder grows with the number of particles and changes over time. The results are of direct application for the modeling of states of matter, such as plasmas, as well as problems with particle-like behavior, such as vortices in fluids or superconductors and the training of neural networks. The methods developed to tackle these problems, based on measuring how the energy or entropy of a system varies in space and time, will establish new connections between different areas of mathematics of independent interest. A key feature of the project is the integration of research and educational activities, promoting the goals of the Federal 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan. Through summer courses for advanced high-school students, new undergraduate curricula focused on mathematical communication, working groups, and supervising undergraduate and graduate student projects, the research program will provide opportunities for the mentorship and training of a new generation of researchers in the U.S. at this intersection of mathematics, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>Building on the investigator?s extensive work, the project addresses fundamental, open questions for the large time, beyond leading order description of Coulomb/Riesz gases. The two main lines of investigation are (1) central limit theorems for fluctuations around the mean-field limit and cumulant expansions that capture the system disorder and corrections to the mean-field limit; (2) the interplay between generation of chaos in these systems (the phenomenon of the particles becoming independent and identically distributed in the joint large time and system size limit), log Sobolev inequalities (LSIs), and relaxation estimates for gradient flows. The project develops both the physical and mathematical understanding of Coulomb/Riesz gases. (1) advances several new conjectures for the scaling of fluctuations and cumulants, their limiting dynamics, and the optimal rate of convergence to Gaussianity, quantifying the disorder as a function of the system size, length scale of observation, temperature, and singularity of interaction. These questions are all open except in limited cases, and the project stands to shape the future direction of the field. (2) develops the new connection between generation of chaos and LSIs for Gibbs measures, which has wide application beyond Coulomb/Riesz gases, with emphasis on LSIs for nonconvex energies, which is a major challenge in the field. The project develops new mathematical tools, such as commutator and gradient flow relaxation estimates, which have potential applications across analysis/PDE and probability. Lastly, Coulomb/Riesz gases are an important testing ground for the longer-term goal of answering fundamental questions of statistical mechanics for more general systems arising in machine learning, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research addresses both fundamental and applied physics, with potential to bring innovations for quantum technologies. The analytical methods developed in this work will be applicable to a wide range of problems in the quantum physics of low-dimensional systems.<br/><br/>Modern technology relies on electronic devices that perform a variety of functions, such as transistors, diodes, and other key components. The central theme of this project is to investigate nonreciprocal transport phenomena. Nonreciprocity in quantum materials refers to the phenomenon where a system?s response to an external stimulus (such as electric current, magnetic field, or light) depends on the direction of the applied stimulus. In other words, the system?s transport or optical properties are asymmetric when the direction of the current or field is reversed, violating conventional reciprocity relations. One of the main goals of this project is to study the superconducting diode effect in materials and junctions, which could lead to new functionalities, since superconductors can support dissipationless currents. Another focus of the research is exploring nonreciprocal thermoelectric effects, where heat can be converted into electricity and vice versa. <br/><br/>The research program is closely integrated with education and outreach efforts. These initiatives include training undergraduate and graduate students and mentoring postdoctoral scholars in advanced topics in quantum physics. To inspire the next generation of physicists, the project will also engage students through science Olympiads and summer schools, providing valuable experience and exposure to modern developments in the field.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>This project focuses on theoretical research in electron quantum transport and nonreciprocity in correlated systems and devices. The research agenda addresses both the fundamental physics of electronic correlations in complex materials and the practical physics of mesoscopic devices, particularly in the context of quantum science and superconducting nanostructures. The proposed scientific program is partly motivated by recent and ongoing experiments and will be conducted in close collaboration with several research groups. These collaborations are a key pillar of the project?s success. The work is structured around three main thrusts, each comprising interconnected sub-projects:<br/><br/>[1] Transport Phenomena in Correlated Electron Systems. This thrust aims to develop a new kinetic theory that accurately accounts for correlations between electron scattering and long-range disorder potentials. These potentials may manifest as scalar or pseudo-vector fields, particularly relevant to multi-valley conductors with spatially varying strain. Applications include transport in topological moir systems and nonlinear phenomena such as magnetochiral anisotropy and second harmonic generation.<br/><br/>[2] Noncentrosymmetric Superconducting Systems. This line of research investigates the microscopic mechanisms underlying the superconducting diode effect, explores spin-galvanic effects, and studies interferometry in multiterminal Josephson junctions. It also aims to uncover transport anomalies at the interface between quantum Hall systems and superconductors.<br/><br/>[3] Correlated Electronic Multilayers. This thrust explores electronic crystal phases in two-dimensional materials and investigates anomalous and nonreciprocal Coulomb drag phenomena in 1D and 2D devices, as well as the behavior of odd electron liquids.<br/><br/>The project strongly emphasizes training graduate and undergraduate students by integrating them into research within a highly collaborative environment alongside postdoctoral scholars and colleagues from other groups. Additionally, the outreach and engagement component of the program targets a broad audience, including the general public, middle and high school students, and professional physics majors. Key components of this program include: Science Olympiad (preparing and mentoring students for science competitions); Podium Speaker Series (hosting talks to inspire and engage students in STEM fields); Quantum Summer Schools (organizing local summer schools to support students from Midwestern states and coordinating the advanced Boulder Summer School); Scientific Coordination of Events (organizing conferences and workshops to foster scientific collaboration).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-experimentation has been gaining traction due to the $54 billion health tracking industry. However, there is a mismatch between what technology currently provides (for example, step counts and sleep scores) and what people expect from it, which is personalized health insights and recommendations. This project seeks to understand and enhance the agency of individuals to make decisions about their health and wellbeing by supporting explorations such as, ?Is coffee or milk the trigger for my irritable bowel syndrome symptoms? Does taking aspirin affect my menstrual flow? Will exercising in the evening improve my sleep quality??  This project?s designs will lead to more personalized feedback for health concerns such as physical activity, diet, and sleep. The research will thus support current efforts to manage chronic diseases in the United States, for example, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In addition to engaging with different types of communities, this project will advance education by improving how students are taught to use the scientific approach to answer questions about their own health through self-experimentation. <br/><br/>This project will transform how we approach technology to support personal health management. It will expand our understanding of self-experimentation and significantly impact technology design to support and empower individuals in managing their health and wellbeing. Specifically, the research will contribute a new theory in the form of the life-cycle model of self-experimentation, its stages along with their associated properties and barriers. The project will also provide empirical evidence of design patterns addressing known challenges, such as improving experiment selection through novel interface design patterns to support goal elicitation and personalized data representations. Other known challenges include improving robustness of experimentation data through tailored experiment designs and learning-based experimentation support, and personalizing communication of findings through tailored visualizations and post-experiment paths of action. By systematically understanding and addressing the barriers and needs for effective self-experimentation this research will reshape self-experimentation from a challenging and unreliable tool available only to people with advanced knowledge and significant resources to a well-understood practice accessible to individuals throughout their health tracking journey.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is sculpted by a rich array of physical processes, and so observations of the ISM can be used to decipher the poorly understood physics that governs the formation of stars and the evolution of gas in galaxies. Astronomers observe the ISM in many wavelengths of light. This proposal will develop novel tools to unlock the physical information encoded in those observations. This work will generate a new understanding of the gas, dust, and magnetic fields in our Milky Way galaxy.

Thus, understanding how plants grow and develop is critical for the success of the human population. As in all multicellular organisms, plant cells must communicate with each other to form boundaries between tissues and ultimately establish a body plan. Unlike animal cells, plant cells are surrounded by walls permanently locking cells to their sisters. The cell wall not only establishes boundaries between single cells but also dictates that organ development results from cell expansion that must be coordinated with neighboring cells in the organ. This proposal will investigate how small molecules made by the plant orchestrate organ formation. This project will also contribute to the public?s understanding of plant biology and inspire the next generation of scientists. A teaching program will be launched in rural high schools centered around active learning activities that will enhance student?s knowledge of agriculture and plant science.

These peptides are recognized by plasma membrane-bound receptor-like kinases that contain an extracellular leucine-rich repeat. While many of the peptides and receptors are conserved, it has been challenging to narrow down peptide-receptor pairs and their functions due to the large number of peptides and receptors encoded in seed plant genomes. With a more reduced set of peptides and receptors, the non-seed model plant species Physcomitrium patens provides a unique opportunity to take a genome-wide approach to investigate receptor function. Furthermore the P. patens genome is readily and rapidly edited using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, making it possible to perform genome-wide screens of peptide and receptor function. Coupling CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing with forward genetics approaches and proximity labeling the project will map out signaling modules from novel peptides to downstream effectors.

When combined with tiny machine learning technologies, these devices are further enabled with in-situ data processing and real-time decision-making capabilities. However, integrating tiny machine learning algorithms into battery-less IoT devices presents significant challenges involving data acquisition, model training, and model deployment, all under stringent constraints of power, cost, memory, and computation. Operational intermittence due to frequent power failures, further complicates functionality. Once deployed, tiny machine learning models typically operate under fixed sensor sampling rates and are only able to make timely decisions when there is sufficient power. Moreover, the extended operational life of these systems introduces a novel challenge: the obsolescence of AI algorithms or programs as sensory inputs and/or environmental conditions evolve. There is a need for a holistic framework that offers energy efficient solutions capable of responding to sensory input, adapting to environmental changes, and maintaining code currency to ensure continued accuracy and responsiveness. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing innovative methods for adaptive tiny machine learning integration in battery-less IoT systems, ensuring long-term, reliable operation in dynamic, energy-variable environments.<br/><br/>This research will advance battery-less systems through three coherent advancements: 1) fundamental redesign and optimization of tiny machine learning models for self-powered IoT devices to enable timely data analysis and decision-making; 2) development of a holistic framework that supports adaptive data collection, decision-making, and communication strategies attuned to the dynamics of varying ambient environments; and 3) design of reliable and efficient code update mechanism to maintain program currency under frequent power interruptions.

One alternative to traditional microbial control processes is to specifically tune the bacterial community of water systems using mixtures of bacteriophages to kill the bacteria. Currently, the design of these mixtures (bacteriophage cocktails) is slow and laborious, relying on trial and error to identify the most effective combinations of bacteriophages. This CAREER project will develop a platform for the rational design of bacteriophage cocktails, based on the hypothesis that safe and effective bacteriophage cocktails will have specific gene and transcript (mRNA) profiles that are distinct from those that have antagonistic or off-target effects. The research will address the following objectives: (1) identify genetic and transcriptomic markers of synergistic versus antagonistic bacteriophage cocktail interactions and (2) assess off-target infection risks using experimental and computational approaches. The education objectives will (1) ensure that students have the skills for further developing bacteriophage biocontrol technologies by creating educational materials and hands-on bacteriophage discovery experiences for high school and college students and (2) encourage knowledge exchange between researchers and practitioners by convening a practitioner advisory board. This project will contribute to the development of a systematic understanding of the features of safe and effective bacteriophage cocktails. Together, the tightly coupled research and educational objectives of this CAREER project will accelerate the development of improved microbial control technologies, reducing the costs of unwanted microbial growth and better protecting human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because both beneficial and harmful bacteria use microcompartments, understanding their assembly and mechanisms of action could allow us to engineer bacterial strains to combat chemical pollution and carbon dioxide surpluses, or conversely to design antibiotics less likely to promote widespread resistance.  The project combines cryo-electron tomography, mathematical modeling and simulation, and biochemical assays to develop a model of how these large protein assemblies are built, mature, and function. This research is part of an increasing trend toward interdisciplinary science, yet many students struggle to cross traditional scientific divisions. Therefore, the project also includes an education plan focused on developing the necessary skills to analyze and interpret the various types of research data in the molecular life sciences. Group-based projects with raw data will be developed for a large enrollment Bioanalytical Chemistry class. ?Best practices? methods will be published for use by other educators.<br/><br/>The best-studied and simplest microcompartment known is the alpha-carboxysome, which allows ocean bacteria to utilize CO2 to build sugars for metabolism. The carboxysome has a protein shell and contains just two enzymes: carbonic anhydrase that converts ocean bicarbonate to CO2, and Rubisco that removes the carbon from CO2 for downstream metabolism. Carboxysomes are so stable that they are passed from cell to cell, living far longer than the cell that originally made them. In addition, they are so efficient that cells without them die even if they still have the enzymes in the cytoplasm. How the microcompartment is assembled and the enzyme components organize to become a stable, efficient carbon-fixing machine will be studied.  The lessons learned from this detailed study will then be applied to the characterization of a more complex system, the propanediol-utilization compartment that allows Salmonella to thrive in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Taken together, these studies of beneficial and pathogenic microcompartments will both provide new insights into prokaryotic metabolism and create blueprints of powerful machines whose redesign could lead to new technologies or whose disruption could treat mammalian illness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many real-world data sets, such as genetic information or molecular images, contain hidden structures that can be uncovered using geometric methods. Leveraging these hidden structures can decrease the computational resources needed to analyze large data sets and can also provide scientific insight regarding various biological and physical processes. The goal of this project is to harness the full power of geometric methods for modern machine learning by the design of innovative solutions to the critical challenges facing the field. The project will focus on developing methods that can handle noisy data and tools for data visualization that preserve important geometric details. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will have a broad impact by offering new educational programs to support student mental health, increase diversity in data science, and encourage underrepresented groups to engage in this field. By addressing both technical and social challenges, the project aims to create more reliable, scalable tools for data analysis while promoting inclusion and innovation in science and education.  <br/><br/>In many applications, real data often concentrates around low-dimensional structures or manifolds, and manifold learning algorithms are a powerful tool for uncovering this low-dimensional structure. The project is on manifold learning algorithms, tackling the key challenges facing the field, including how noise affects algorithm performance, how to preserve both local and global geometric details, and how to effectively handle complex collections of manifolds. This research will investigate best practices for denoising, analyze how noise impacts spectral manifold learning algorithms, and clarify the regime in which algorithms can reliably recover manifold structure. The project will develop novel algorithms that utilize diffusion to faithfully encode geometric information at various scales and also hybrid methods for geometric regularization of manifold learning algorithms. Since real data often fails to concentrate around a single manifold, this work will contribute a robust and scalable solution for clustering collections of manifolds via a novel angle-based path metric on simplices, so that manifold learning algorithms can be applied under less restrictive assumptions. In addition, since data often contains numerous irrelevant features and features measured on very different scales, the project aims to develop a probabilistic framework for learning and adjusting features according to their actual relevance. Overall, the goal is to design a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that is noise-robust and capable of balancing local and global geometric information to represent data in just a few dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such structures occur naturally, and for example give butterfly wings their brilliant color. In the lab, synthetic fabrication of optical microstructures has had deep technological impact in fields such as information storage and display, and is based on exposing a photosensitive film to laser light or an electron beam.  While this technique is well-established, it is not suited for rapid prototyping.  Another limitation is that the fabricated structures are immobile on the film surface once the film processing is complete.  However, an emerging material class of organic molecule coupled with a flexible polymer have been found to be sensitive to the direction of illumination and not its brightness.  This sensitivity to light polarization can be exploited to make dynamic surface microstructures, enabling not only permanent optical microstructures, but also structures which can be reconfigured in response to light.  This mechanical response to light can be coupled with new technologies in programmable light modulators to create a new platform for the on-demand fabrication of both static and dynamic optical microstructures. Such a system will make rapid prototyping of light-diffracting surfaces accessible to a wide range of optical manufacturers, while also enabling new techniques in color engineering that rely on the use of microscale surfaces.  <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>Surface microstructures enable photonics applications in miniaturized planar optics and are likewise used in bioengineering and materials science applications where surfaces with tunable anisotropy are required. They are typically fabricated using laser light to expose a photosensitive film through a photomask.  The proposed research exploits a new fabrication process that combines the photomechanical response of azopolymer films with programmable spatial light modulators to enable one-step, maskless, and reversible writing of surface microstructures. The proposed research will advance this methodology towards the one-step laser printing of planar diffractive optics and the printing of light-reconfigurable microarchitectures using pre-patterned template films.  To accomplish these, the proof-of-concept system developed by the principal investigator will be significantly advanced towards not only optimal spatial resolution but also enabled with a new intensity-masking spatial light modulator component that will facilitate the programmable spatial addressing of optical intensity and polarization at the film surface.  These new capabilities will transform the proof-of-concept system developed previously towards one capable of printing planar diffractive optics, which in many applications can replace bulky refractive optics, an essential step towards novel optical integrated circuits.  Such flat optics are in high demand and the principal investigator will collaborate with a local photonics company on designs most appropriate for emerging applications. This next-generation laser printing system will also enable a new form of hybrid lithography in which high-spatial resolution nanostructures fabricated with specialized techniques such as electron beam lithography are first replicated in equivalent azopolymer film structures and subsequently optically reconfigured towards the final design structure.  This concept of using prepatterned template films will open up new optically-driven microarchitectures, not previously accessible using conventional lithography or laser-based lithography working independently<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines how communities vulnerable to flooding respond to compounding disasters of inundation and other ecological stressors. Specifically, the project explores whether the social, technical, and ecological drivers of land-use dynamics in contexts of inland riverine flooding are influenced by localized mutual aid networks. It is well documented that first responders and other officials encounter communication difficulties in the context of flooding events. The researchers ask whether mutual aid and other networks establish obligations and responsibilities that enable recovery and mitigation efforts. The research produces a community-based floodplain mapping tool to improve communication and collaboration across scales in disaster response, recovery, and mitigation. The tool is shared with local communities. The project expands participation in STEM learning for community science youth fellows, undergraduate, and graduate students. Dissemination plans improve engagement with community science and improve the public?s understanding of science and the scientific method. This project is jointly funded by Cultural Anthropology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>This project studies how rural communities respond to overlapping disasters of flood water inundation, and a range of other ecological stressors. In preliminary research, investigators have seen that community members, local responders, disaster response agents, and others do not have easy ways to communicate before, during, and after flooding. This is in part due to lack of shared language, and lack of adequate tools for collaboration across these different groups. This project studies processes of response, recovery, and mitigation work in these river valleys. The team conducts on-the-ground in these rural areas on land-use regulation and practice during and after floods; and how social forces, economic realities, and technical infrastructure shape the impacts of land use. This project focuses on how communication, responsibility, and collective community assistance works after disaster. The researcher will conduct behavioral observation at community meetings; interviews with river corridor and floodplain managers, other rural extension and food security stakeholders, and regional planning commission officers; a survey (n=500) on perceptions of optimal land and river use and risks with residents in three floodplain communities; and archival analyses to gather longitudinal data on flood risk and resilience. The project advances scientific debates about land use practices in rural floodplain contexts, asking whether municipal-level policies of zoning in upstream and downstream contexts influence community responses to flooding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These infections, broadly termed healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), impose a significant health and economic burden, with an estimated 4.5 HAIs per 100 hospital admissions and annual costs ranging from $28 to $45 billion dollars. The health and economic burden of HAIs can be mitigated by deploying timely and effective interventions. This project aims to develop novel computational approaches to identify effective intervention strategies by leveraging electronic medical records data. The proposed intervention strategies will also incorporate predictions about potential future infections and the previously unobserved missing/asymptomatic infections inferred by machine learning algorithms. The algorithms developed will lead to practical resource recommendations before and during an HAI outbreak and help mitigate a wide range of secondary effects (e.g., the development of antimicrobial resistance organisms). <br/><br/>A significant outcome of the project will be the formulation of a novel class of online optimization problems and the resulting suite of online resource algorithms with worst-case approximation and hardness guarantees.

It also tackles the problem of inferring unobserved infection events (e.g., asymptomatic cases and surface contamination) and incorporates them into the online intervention algorithms. Advances will be made in the evaluation of data-driven algorithms in HAI intervention, inference, and forecasting tasks by setting standardized benchmarks. The real-time recommendations made by the online algorithms developed as part of this project will lead to near-optimal resource strategies to reduce the risk of HAI and secondary outbreaks.

The PI plans to mentor two post-baccalaureate students, who will perform case studies of individual star-forming regions in the new 3D model. The PI also plans to be the scientific lead of the newly-launched STARS (Scientists Taking Astronomy to Rural Schools) program at the Center for Astrophysics, which will provide telescopes and training to rural high schools across the United States. Within the STARS program, the PI will develop and launch a new learning module linking the ?2D? sky observable with these telescopes to the new 3D motion picture of our local Milky Way. <br/><br/>Leveraging advances in 3D dust mapping and young stellar cluster modeling enabled by Gaia, this team will produce three novel observational data products describing the solar neighborhood. First, they will leverage techniques from the field of topological data analysis to produce new 3D spatial models of gaseous features (e.g. clouds and voids) detected in recent 3D dust maps. Linking 3D dust maps with the dynamics of the gas obtainable from spectral-line maps, the team will produce new models of gas flows around these features. And finally, the team will generate a new pipeline for analyzing the ages and masses of nearby young stellar clusters to place new constraints on the relationship between these gaseous features and the star formation and supernova feedback activity of their associated young stellar populations. When combined, these data products will lead to new understanding of how molecular clouds form out of the diffuse interstellar medium, how star formation varies as a function of environment, and how supernova feedback shapes molecular cloud growth and regulates star formation. The data and software will be publicly released and incorporated into a new 3D interactive visualization of the solar neighborhood viewable by anyone with an internet connection. This interactive 3D visualization dashboard will allow both astronomers and the public to explore these never-before-seen 3D views of gas and young stars in the solar neighborhood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since their discovery in 1969, they have shown great promise for use in important technologies, including sensors, transducers, actuators, and energy harvesters. However, their adoption has been limited by their low performance when compared to piezoelectric ceramics, which are predominantly used today. This project addresses a key scientific question: how do piezoelectric polymers work at the molecular level? Specifically, which part of these semicrystalline polymers contributes primarily to the observed piezoelectricity - the crystalline regions, the amorphous regions, or the interphase between the two? To tackle this challenge, the project will employ computer simulation, advanced polymer processing, structural analysis, and property characterization to uncover the mechanisms behind polymer piezoelectricity. With the resolution of this fundamental question, researchers would be able to develop advanced piezoelectric polymers that can rival, or even exceed, the performance of piezoelectric ceramics. The products of this research could have far-reaching impacts. High-performance piezoelectric polymers could enable more efficient and lightweight medical devices for ultrasound imaging and therapy, enhance wearable electronics, and drive innovations in robotics. Beyond the scientific benefits, this project prioritizes education and outreach to inspire and train the next generation of scientists and engineers. It also includes hands-on research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Since the discovery of chain-folding in single lamellar crystals, a two-phase model (i.e., crystalline and amorphous phases) has been used to describe semicrystalline polymers. However, for melt- and solid state-processed semicrystalline polymers, studies using temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry have revealed a third component: the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF). It is suggested that chain-folding may not be the predominant packing scheme for these materials. Instead, a substantial portion of the polymer chains extends directly from the crystalline basal planes, forming an oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) that gradually transitions into the isotropic amorphous fraction (IAF). The tethering of OAF to rigid crystals results in reduced mobility, making it an RAF. By integrating computer simulation and experimental studies, this project aims to elucidate the OAF structure in semicrystalline ferroelectric polymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). It is hypothesized that the electrostrictive OAF is the major contributor to the piezoelectric property. Initially, computer simulation will be used to calculate the structural factor of OAF in PVDF and compare it with the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns to gain insights into the OAF structure. Subsequently, a revised nanocomposite model, consisting of crystals, OAF and IAF will be utilized to simulate the piezoelectric response. Additionally, nanocrystalline PVDF will be explored to increase the OAF content and enhance the piezoelectricity. Finally, multiblock copolymers, composed of ferroelectric copolymers and electrostrictive terpolymers of PVDF, will be synthesized to investigate new opportunities. The goal of this research is an improved fundamental understanding of the structure-piezoelectric property relationship in semicrystalline ferroelectric polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can be very costly, especially when materials have random or disordered features. While machine learning (ML) can speed up some parts of the design process, it does not always provide clear physical insights, such as why the connectivity of one material phase strongly affects overall conductivity or how certain patterns might enhance stiffness. This project addresses the challenge of making material design both efficient and explainable by focusing on the concept of N-point correlation functions (NPCFs). An NPCF is a statistical measure describing how different regions of a material relate to one another. By systematically learning which NPCFs matter most for a given property, the research will provide both accurate predictions and clear insights about the structure-property relationship. In addition to improving the design of smart composites for soft robotics, the methods developed will lay the foundation for broader applications in biological systems, climate modeling, and other areas where disordered structures play a critical role. The educational activities developed through this project will help K-12 students understand material structure-property relationships through hands-on experiments and contribute to training the next generation of researchers at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and computational science. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project investigates how to identify concise and complete microstructure representations for two-phase, disordered heterogeneous materials. Since these microstructures can be treated as random fields, the research focuses on N-point correlation functions (NPCFs) as the core representation. Although machine learning models can approximate structure-property mappings, they often do not reveal the underlying physical causes. To address this, the project leverages a strong contrast expansion formalism, which links material properties to microstructure morphology through physics-based governing equations, such as partial differential equations (PDEs). By interpreting linear and nonlinear effective properties as expansions in terms of Green?s functions and NPCFs, the research team will develop new computational algorithms to learn both the necessary Green?s functions and the relevant NPCFs directly from data. These algorithms will provide a physics-driven mechanism for down-selecting which NPCFs are most critical, leading to an explainable and more efficient representation for microstructure reconstruction and property prediction.<br/><br/>To demonstrate practical value, the project will apply these methods to the design of a bi-phase composite with specific mechanical and thermal transport properties relevant to soft robotics. By uncovering how different morphological features affect performance, the research aims to streamline the design process for materials that must satisfy coupled mechanical and thermal requirements. Beyond this specific application, the methods and principles developed will be broadly applicable to other random fields where PDE-driven properties dominate, such as multi-phase materials, biological systems, climate science, and cosmology.<br/><br/>In addition to advancing knowledge in materials science, the project has a broader impact on data science by prompting new ideas for efficiently representing and modeling random fields. Just as insights into sequence modeling led to transformational language models, and insights into graph structures enabled advanced drug discovery methods, this research explores whether NPCFs can serve as essential building blocks for future architectures that handle large-scale or high-dimensional random fields. The developed educational activities will also contribute to training the next generation of researchers at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and computational science. <br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers are essential to daily life, from technologies such as plastics to biopolymers such as DNA. A diblock copolymer is created by bonding two chemically different polymers at their ends. In most cases, different polymers do not want to mix, so they phase separate similar to the way that oil and water separate in salad dressing. In contrast, block polymers cannot phase separate because the two blocks are bonded at their ends. Rather, block polymers spontaneously undergo a process known as ?self-assembly? to create an ordered structure with nanometer-sized domains that minimizes the frustration created by their inability to phase separate. These domains can have different physical properties, e.g., regularly spaced, rubbery spherical inclusions in an otherwise glassy material, creating multifunctional materials. Self-assembly occurs in a wide range of soft materials, from soaps to biomaterials, and block polymers serve as an important model system to understand the physics that drives self-assembly.<br/><br/>A long-standing goal in this area is predicting the ordered structure that will result from self-assembly based on the chemistry of the different blocks, the number of monomers in each block, and the temperature. Such a predictive ability would remove the need for tedious trial-and-error experimentation. The theory of block polymer self-assembly is remarkably powerful but suffers from a ?chicken or the egg? conundrum: To perform the required calculations, one needs to know the structure that will be formed in advance. While this need poses no problems for understanding what has already been observed in experiments, it makes it extremely difficult to discover new block polymer materials via theory. This project will overcome this challenge, using generative artificial intelligence methods, similar to those that create new pictures from a library of images, to generate new possible block polymer structures by learning from a library of known structures. Machine learning will then be used to identify block polymers with appropriate chemistries and processing temperatures that will spontaneously form these new structures. <br/><br/>This project will turn the theory of block polymer self-assembly from a tool primarily used for explanation to one that can be used for exploration and, ultimately, to design new materials with novel properties. The development of these computational techniques will provide graduate and undergraduate researchers with advanced training in polymer physics and high-performance computing, contributing to the US workforce, and the computer codes developed for this work will be released to the public so that others can use them for their research. High school students will be involved in the generative artificial intelligence part of the project, developing projects for the Minnesota Science Fair and sparking their interest in pursuing materials science as a future career path.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Block polymers are amphiphilic materials created by bonding two or more different polymers at their ends. Below the order-disorder temperature, a block polymer melt selects an ordered state that balances chain stretching and interfacial tension, subject to the constraint of filling space at constant density. Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has proven to be a remarkably successful approach for understanding the block polymer thermodynamics governing order state selection. However, the non-linear governing equations in SCFT require high quality initial guesses for convergence. These computational challenges pose an obstacle when using SCFT to discover new block polymer phases. To overcome this obstacle, this project will use a generative adversarial network that learns from existing SCFT solutions to propose starting points for subsequent SCFT calculations, which are expected to converge to novel solutions. Those solutions are anticipated to be metastable states. As a result, a hierarchical computational method will be developed to efficiently solve the inverse problem of identifying block polymer formulations that stabilize those new phases. This computational workflow will be used to identify novel phases in triblock terpolymers. In addition to exhibiting a wide variety of ordered states, triblock terpolymers are synthetically tractable with fast ordering kinetics, making experimental tests of the predictions from this project realistic.<br/><br/>Block polymers are the model system for understanding self-assembly in amphiphilic soft matter owing to their relatively simple thermodynamics, and SCFT?s ability to capture those thermodynamics is a major success in soft matter theory. However, SCFT has largely been relegated to an explanatory role in block polymer self-assembly; discovery typically results from serendipitous experimentation and then theory provides a physical rationale. This project turns the paradigm on its head by developing a powerful computational approach to discover new candidate phases and then identify block polymer formulations to produce those materials. The tools developed through this research will be made available to the community as open-source software. This project will provide both graduate and undergraduate students with advanced training in polymer physics, materials science, computer science, and numerical methods. K-12 education will be enhanced through an outreach effort with the Breck School to develop projects for the Minnesota Science Fair. <br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interaction is essential for pollination and food production. Surprisingly, recent studies show that plants can ""listen"" to the sound of pollinators, such as the buzzing of bees, and respond by producing sweeter nectar. How plants achieve this remains a mystery. This award aims to uncover the physical and molecular mechanisms that allow plants to detect and respond to sound. The principal investigator (PI) proposes that the plant cell wall acts like a filter, vibrating at specific frequencies, while structures called Hechtian strands help transmit these vibrations to the cell's interior. This process could trigger changes inside the cell, leading to the production of sugars and other responses critical for pollination. By studying these processes in detail using cutting-edge tools and techniques, this award will provide new insights into how plants interact with their environment.<br/><br/>Beyond advancing scientific knowledge, this project has practical applications in agriculture.

Interactions between the charge carriers and near-infrared light, which triggers dynamics sensitive to their molecular environment, could be exploited as a sensor of ion and charge transport behavior. Using this concept, Professor Grieco and his students will perform ultrafast near-infrared laser spectroscopy experiments on conducting polymers under applied voltage to learn how ion and charge carrier transport is affected by the polymer's macromolecular structure. Their discoveries could lead to better conducting materials required for advancing electrochemical technologies from biosensors to flexible and lightweight electronics.

First, a transient Stark effect creates an electroabsorption signal that is sensitive to the electronic structure of surrounding polymer chains. Second, the picosecond re-equilibration kinetics of the ion-polaron pair report on trapping. In this project, experiments will be carried out to further develop this spectroscopy approach for probing polarons in working conducting polymer electrodes, and to elucidate how charge carrier dynamics can be controlled. Results could lead to chemical and structural design principles for enhancing mixed ionic-electronic conductivity in polymers to advance emerging technologies from flexible bioelectronics to electrochemical energy storage.

U.S. law requires that upon taking a criminal suspect into custody, police must issue Miranda warnings about the suspect?s rights to silence and counsel. During questioning, police are prohibited from using coercion that ?overbears the suspect?s will? to extract a confession. Understanding perceptions of custody and coercion is essential because violations of these laws and principles can lead to inaccurate outcomes, such as false confessions and wrongful convictions. Moreover, when a confession is false, an innocent person is punished while the true perpetrator remains at large, which poses a significant threat to public safety. Judges and juries are tasked with evaluating custody and coercion in legal proceedings, and these decisions have serious and enduring consequences. Psychological science can deepen understanding of perceptions of custody and coercion and thereby help legal decision makers to assess custody and coercion in a transparent and consistent manner. <br/><br/>Police interviews of subjects in custody are difficult to study in a way that is simultaneously scientifically rigorous, ethically conscious, and ecologically valid. This research harnesses Virtual Reality (VR), an innovative technological tool, to study perceptions of custody and coercion. The study introduces late adolescents and emerging adults to police interrogation in an immersive 3D environment. Study participants virtually ?experience? an interrogation, scripted from a real case. Four VR conditions are designed to assess whether and how the type of interrogation strategy, which is a key factor that judges consider when evaluating the voluntariness of the interaction, affects perceptions of custody and coercion, as well as decision-making with respect to confessions. The investigators also compare outcomes across two non-VR conditions (standard 2D video and a transcript), which mimic real-world materials that judges evaluate in disputed confession cases.

Historical observations have shown that oxygen concentrations are declining in many parts of the oceans, termed ?ocean deoxygenation?. The causes of the decline are linked to changes in surface water temperature and its impact on oxygen solubility, along with variations in the strength of the biological pump, ocean circulation, vertical mixing, ventilation, and biochemical processes. It is difficult to calculate exactly how much ocean oxygen has been lost to the atmosphere and how much has been redistributed within the ocean interior. This project will compare observation-based gridded oxygen datasets with the purpose of generating comparable four-dimensional (space and time) estimates of global oxygen distribution, assessing their similarities and differences and promoting scientific understanding of the drivers of ocean deoxygenation. The project will promote workforce development through support of an early career investigator, a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate interns.<br/><br/>The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the causes of disagreements between different gridded oxygen datasets by conducting an intercomparison of oxygen datasets from common in situ observational and model-based profiles. Many factors can affect estimates of a deoxygenation trend: existing observational studies use different sets of raw data, measurement platforms, data quality control metrics, land-ocean masks, vertical and horizontal grids and interpolation methods. Because variations in any of these factors can lead to different estimates, it is difficult to make direct comparisons and determine the causes of disagreements among datasets. Standardized protocols will be applied to isolate the interpolation method as the only source of discrepancy and to assess uncertainties in global oxygen inventory trends. The second goal is to test hypotheses for the underlying causes of ocean deoxygenation. The suite of new datasets will be used to evaluate the roles of oxygen solubility, the biological pump, and physical and biogeochemical processes driving global ocean deoxygenation. Further, the mechanisms driving the expansion of the tropical ocean oxygen minimum zones will be explored. The use of novel datasets with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution in these analyses will enable new insights into global and regional oxygen content changes. The suite of gridded oxygen datasets will be made available via public data repositories, and the results of the product intercomparisons and deoxygenation analyses will be disseminated via open-access papers.

DNA sequencing will identify the important microbes. Greenhouse experiments will expand this across the range of pion pine by comparing seedling growth in soils from sites with different severities of drought. This project will develop new methods to restore pion trees in areas devastated by drought. The seedlings of most tree species rely on beneficial microbes to survive and grow.

Properties that will be studied include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters and natural optical activity, with potential applications in catalysis and in the design of new light-emitting materials. The accurate prediction of these properties, and discerning their exact role in targeted applications remain a key challenge in computational chemistry. Professor Autschbach and his students will investigate the optical activity of novel helicene-based systems, open-shell states of organic molecules with unpaired electrons, including helicenes with radical substituents, and how dynamics in solutions influences NMR spin relaxation. The project provides training for graduate and undergraduate students and create opportunities for summer internships of high-school students in scientific computer programming. Professor Autschbach will also create free-to-use educational scientific visualizations and open-source computational research tools. <br/><br/>The project focuses on molecular properties that are of high practical value in informing about the structures and functions of molecules, and the dynamics of chemical systems. The theory developments and simulations will be crucial to establish and refine the sought-after structure-property relationships. The project will focus specifically on NMR relaxation phenomena driven by the underlying dynamics of molecules, and on the structural and electronic origins of optical activity. In addition, the behavior of  organic radicals with an unusual inversion of the highest occupied level of molecular orbitals and the energy of the singly occupied orbital will be studied by calculations, complemented by experiments that are being carried out in the laboratories of Professor Autschbach?s scientific collaborators. NMR relaxation contains a wealth of information about the dynamics and the characteristic dynamic time scales of a chemical system. Relaxation will be predicted by ab-initio and force-field molecular dynamics simulations. The optical activity-related part of the project focuses on circularly polarized luminescence, and on the properties of metal complexes with ligands that combine N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and helicene moieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether negotiating a business deal, teaching a child, or simply having fun with friends, people need certain skills to interact successfully with others. One of the most important of these skills is the ability to understand other people?s mental states: their thoughts, feelings, beliefs, desires, and intentions. Understanding others? mental states is useful because it helps people to more effectively plan their own actions during interactions (e.g., knowing when to call someone?s bluff, or when a loved one needs cheering up). This project studies how, precisely, people understand each other?s mental states, and how their brains make this understanding possible. <br/><br/>This project investigates three key parts of mental state understanding: 1) how people detect which mental state(s) another person is currently experiencing, 2) how people predict what mental states others are likely to experience in the future, and 3) how people intervene to change or regulate other people?s mental states. Using tightly controlled experiments designed to capture real-world mental state dynamics, the project measures how people learn to detect, predict, and regulate mental states. In parallel, deep neural network models learn to complete the same tasks. By testing how well different models explain human behavior and corresponding brain activity, this research provides insight into the mechanisms that support mental state understanding. By characterizing the computational and neural mechanisms of mental state understanding, this research lays the foundation for developing ways to improve a wide variety of human social interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As adolescents engage in new behaviors, they may experience good or bad outcomes, learn from the experience, and use what is learned when faced with a new situation. The goal of this project is to understand the cognitive and brain mechanisms related to learning from experience, and how these change from childhood to adolescence and then to young adulthood.  The project tests a relatively novel characterization of adolescence as a time when learning from experience is heavily weighted both at behavioral and brain level. In addition to the scientific work, the project includes STEM outreach in K-12 schools and internships for high school students.<br/><br/>In more detail, learning from experience has been broadly described as motivated learning. Motivated learning is critical for behaving adaptively, but little is known about the neurocognitive development of motivated learning. The project uses behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging approaches to investigate age-related changes in learning and integration of different types of learning.  In particular, the project focuses on striatal and medial-temporal learning systems in the brain, and how these change across development.  Notably, the project also uses a novel brain imaging technique to make inferences about dopamine to better understand its role in learning over the course of development.  The results of the proposed work have the potential to better understand critical changes in the adolescent brain, focusing not just on vulnerabilities but also on adaptive opportunities and strengths related to learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the drivers of exchange rates is a central objective of international macroeconomics and finance. Exchange rates are key prices affecting the relative cost of imports and exports, as well as the returns to investing in assets abroad. Yet exchange rates have long puzzled economists: they are inconsistent with benchmark models in economics and are very difficult to predict. This project makes progress on these puzzles by exploring the relationship between exchange rates and other international asset prices, such as bonds and stocks in different countries, as well as macroeconomic quantities, such as capital flows across borders. This research helps market participants use exchange rates to better understand macroeconomic conditions in the global economy. It also helps decision-makers better understand how monetary and fiscal policies affect exchange rates and thus the broader economy. The research findings could inspire innovative international policy frameworks, improve the well-being of households, businesses, and investors, and reinforce global market activity.<br/><br/>This award project explores exchange rates through the lens of general equilibrium models with international capital market frictions. These capital market frictions are reflected in a central role for global arbitrageurs to intermediate capital flows across borders. Such models thus allow the researchers to accommodate classic forces that have been thought to drive exchange rates, such as the supply or demand for goods, as well as drivers that have been proposed in more recent research, such as changes in the intermediation capacity of global arbitrageurs. The project includes research to decompose the drivers of the dollar exchange rate versus other advanced economies through the lens of such a model. The co-movements of exchange rates with bond yields, spreads in financial markets, and capital flows suggest a nuanced variance decomposition of exchange rates: at high frequencies, shocks to intermediation capacity play an important role in driving exchange rates, but at low frequencies and overall, demand shocks play the most important role. The project includes further research to understand the sources of demand shocks driving variation in these prices and capital flows. The researchers study the co-movements of exchange rates, bonds, and stocks to differentiate between potential sources of demand shocks. The project also includes research to understand how heterogeneous exposures to demand or intermediation shocks can explain differences in exchange rate behavior across countries. The researchers study how patterns in trade linkages and in net foreign assets give rise to heterogeneous effects of these shocks. The project finally includes research on the propagation of macroeconomic policies through exchange rates.  The researchers study whether state-dependence in the effects of foreign exchange rate intervention can account for mixed evidence on its effectiveness in the data. This research could help researchers and decision-makers gain deeper insights into exchange rates and their relationship with international asset prices, capital flows, and other macroeconomic factors, ultimately improving the well-being of the U.S. population and strengthening the country's leadership in international markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural products are small organic molecules that are made by organisms in nature. Natural products have profound impacts on society as commercially, agriculturally, and pharmaceutically relevant chemicals; they also serve as important probes for understanding fundamental processes in chemistry and biology. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), best known for their importance in human health, perform key enzymatic modifications of natural products in a variety of organisms including bacteria. The project aims to discover new natural products through the identification of unique P450s within the genomes of target bacteria and to understand the molecular interactions between P450s and their redox partners, proteins that are required for P450s functionality. This pursuit will allow graduate and undergraduate students to gain valuable training in bioinformatics, molecular biology, bacterial genetics, natural products chemistry, biochemistry, and analytical chemistry techniques. The project will also establish an Undergraduate Mentoring and Career Development Program (UMCDP) for select primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and provide PUI students summer research experience opportunities in the Rudolf Lab. The goals of these programs are to increase awareness of career opportunities in science, provide a route to mentored research opportunities and graduate programs, and educate students in modern research topics and advancements.<br/><br/>P450s are one of the most accomplished ?chemists? employed by nature and the study of microbial P450s reveals their diverse roles in nature, expands their catalytic repertoire, and exposes their potential for biotechnological applications. With the explosion of bacterial genomes now available, it is evident that our understanding and use of P450 catalysis is limited. This proposal seeks to achieve the following objectives: (i) discover novel natural products with unique P450 functionalities, (ii) build a foundation of sequence-structure-function knowledge through the characterization of P450s, and (iii) identify native redox partners of bacterial P450s. These goals will be accomplished through an interdisciplinary approach including genome mining, metabolomics and transcriptomics of native and genetically engineering bacteria, and functional characterization of P450s using genetic knockouts and a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques for in vitro reconstitution. This proposal will make fundamental contributions to natural products biosynthesis and to understanding the general principles of P450 enzymology. In addition, synthetic and biosynthetic chemists who aim to functionalize unactivated C?H bonds or use P450s as biocatalysts will benefit from the results generated by this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This platform aims to replicate ISM conditions in a laboratory setting, covering a broad temperature range (10-5000 K) while ensuring high resolution, sensitivity, and minimal background. Accurately reproducing astrochemical reactions in the lab requires precise control over reactants, a challenge that is particularly complex for molecules containing carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). To overcome this challenge, Professor Zhou and his students will demonstrate precise manipulation and broad tunability of collision energy using a merged beam configuration, where the neutral beam originates from a cryogenic buffer gas cell, and the ion beam is generated within a ring-shaped ion trap. Their work could lead to the establishment of a forefront astrochemistry facility, advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms shaping the universe. As the first experimental platform at the Nevada Center for Astrophysics (NCfA), it will expand NCfA?s mission into laboratory astrophysics, drive cutting-edge research, enhance STEM education, and attract top talent, further elevating the institution?s research profile.<br/><br/>The proposed method centers on the ability to transport ions at the same velocity as neutral species, enabling low-energy collisions in a moving frame. Unlike pulsed beam experiments, this approach utilizes a ring-shaped RF trap to confine the ion beam, making it conceptually closer to static hybrid trap setups, where ion traps overlap with magneto-optical traps. In this configuration, the axial secular frequency of the trapping potential is significantly higher than the circular frequency of ion motion. This key feature distinguishes it from high-energy ion beams in storage rings. As a result, this method offers precise control over ion velocities, ranging from stationary to several thousand meters per second, enabling the study of collisions across a wide energy spectrum with high resolution. The system?s fine control over ion velocity makes it particularly well-suited for interfacing with supersonic or buffer gas-cooled molecular beams, allowing for precise manipulation of collision dynamics. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables extended interrogation periods lasting over a second. This prolonged interaction time is critical for studying slow ion-neutral reactions, allowing for the observation of detailed reaction dynamics that would otherwise be missed in shorter timescales. Enhanced duration not only provides greater control and precision but also significantly improves resolution in analyzing reaction mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Workshop on Urban Mining and Circular Economy in Construction aims to develop a roadmap leading to the advancement and widespread adoption of circular economy in the construction industry. The worshop is scheduled to be held during May 2025 at Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Transitioning to a circular economy is urgent and vital to achieving significant decarbonization, enhancing national economic resilience and fostering national prosperity. This transformation will replace traditional linear construction practices- take, make, consume, and dispose ? with a sustainable, closed-loop system that minimizes waste, maximizes resource efficiency, and reintegrates materials into the supply chain. By promoting reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, the circular approach enables locally available, high-value materials to be reclaimed through urban mining, driving sustainable innovation in the construction sector. Despite its potential, adoption is hindered by challenges such as the lack of advanced technologies, physical infrastructure, and digital systems, alongside entrenched reliance on new materials. Overcoming these barriers requires systemic changes to business models, policies, legislation, and workforce practices to unlock the economic and environmental benefits of building material reuse and recycling.<br/> <br/>This two-day workshop will convene a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders, including scientists, engineers, construction experts, policymakers, and social scientists, to identify barriers of urban mining and circular construction. Participants will collaboratively develop a roadmap for achieving a sustainable circular economy, while fostering innovation and knowledge-sharing through keynote presentations, panels, poster sessions, and networking opportunities. The workshop will also provide a platform for early-career researchers to share their work and receive feedback. Tangible outcomes include a comprehensive summary of key challenges and actionable near- and long-term solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That is the idea behind neuromorphic computing, a new way to design computers inspired by how the human brain processes information. Unlike regular computers, which separate memory and processing, neuromorphic computers combine these functions. This makes them faster, more energy-efficient and better at handling large amounts of data. A promising approach called magnetic skyrmions could make these brain-like computers even better. Skyrmions are tiny, stable magnetic patterns that use very little energy. They could help create powerful computers that learn and adapt. However, controlling skyrmions with electrical signals and making them work on a small scale remains a challenge. This project will solve these problems by exploring new materials and their interface to improve skyrmion control. It will lead to more efficient, powerful computers, and provide hands-on learning opportunities for future scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>Neuromorphic systems, inspired by biological neural networks, require advanced materials and device architectures to replicate brain-like functions. Magnetic skyrmions?nanoscale, topologically protected spin structures?offer promising characteristics such as low energy consumption, stability, and high information density. However, controlling and scaling skyrmion-based devices remains a technical challenge, particularly in conventional heavy metal/ferromagnet systems where energy consumption and limited tunability hinder practical implementation. The objective of this research is to explore new materials and their interface to enable precise and energy-efficient control of skyrmions. Specifically, the project will investigate the ferroelectrics/ferromagnet interface, which has the potential to facilitate efficient electric-field manipulation of skyrmions due to broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. This approach will allow for better control over skyrmion characteristics such as size, chirality, and density. The research tasks include (1) exploring new 2D ferroelectrics and ferromagnets, with a focus on room-temperature ordering, (2) fabricating and characterizing ferroelectrics/ferromagnet heterostructures, utilizing advanced microscopy techniques to observe skyrmion behavior, and (3) using electric gating to manipulate skyrmion properties. The project will integrate experimental investigations with theoretical modeling to understand the physical mechanisms governing skyrmion formation and control. By advancing the understanding of spintronic materials, the project will contribute to the development of next-generation computing technologies. Successful outcomes from this research could enable the development of more efficient, brain-inspired computing systems, fostering innovation in artificial intelligence and advanced data processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in two dimensions, more exotic variants are possible. This project investigates anyons, emergent particles in two-dimensional materials that are neither fermion nor boson. The exotic properties of anyons are not only fundamentally fascinating but also hold potential for future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The research team searches for signatures of anyons by developing novel microscopic methods and exploring new classes of quantum materials. In collaboration with outreach programs, the team excites public interest in quantum physics through hands-on demonstration tours. The project also modernizes university experimental physics education by incorporating quantum information and machine learning methods, and it establishes an online platform to make two-dimensional material preparation more accessible to a broader research community.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Anyons, predicted in topological systems such as the fractional quantum Hall effects, exhibit behaviors governed by their unique quantum statistics. Theory suggests that exchanging two abelian anyons results in a fractional phase shift, while exchanging two non-abelian anyons causes a unitary transformation. Non-abelian anyons feature highly degenerate ground states that are topologically protected from perturbations and can only be altered through particle exchanges, known as braiding, making them excellent candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Although recent interferometry experiments have advanced in detecting abelian anyons, capturing signatures of non-abelian quantum statistics requires more than just extensions of current methods. In this project, the research team utilizes a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to probe and manipulate anyons. This method allows the team to directly visualize anyon wavefunctions, reveal their abelian and non-abelian statistics, and gather valuable real-space information. More importantly, the project leverages STM-induced potentials to manipulate the position of anyons while conducting interferometry, facilitating the demonstration of non-abelian anyon braiding. Furthermore, the project investigates fractional Chern insulators?the zero-field counterparts of the fractional quantum Hall effect?using STM to elucidate the origins of their spontaneous topological properties and potentially enable access to anyons without the need for large magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One factor that determines whether a memory will endure or fade away is how it is processed during sleep. While we sleep, activity in brain networks that represent memories helps some memories survive and thrive. One unknown is whether sleep only helps a memory shortly after it is acquired, or whether it continues to improve memory for a long time thereafter. Previous research generally examines the role of sleep after only one sleep event; this project examines the contribution of multiple nights of sleep to memory, using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational methods. Whereas the current public discourse revolves around sleep?s short-term impact (?sleep well before your test?), the findings could highlight sleep?s lasting impact (?sleep well throughout the semester?).  <br/><br/>The research systematically examines the contribution of multiple nights of sleep to memory, using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational methods. There are three distinct research goals: to examine how memory benefits change with time and sleep using a well-established memory task; to consider whether sleep may play a prolonged role specifically for the weakest memories, which are the most sleep-reliant; and to reveal the constraints for multi-night processing by examining how susceptible memories are to being reactivated during sleep. The work should resolve the conflict between two views of sleep?s role in memory: Does sleep transform memories over a prolonged process or are its contributions a ?one and done? affair, limited to a single night that ?clears the decks? for new learning?

When molecules are placed in carefully designed photonic structures that trap light, they often behave in surprising ways, forming new ?polariton? states that exhibit changes in charge and energy transport or chemical reactivity. These effects could transform photochemistry and catalysis, but they remain poorly understood and hard to predict. Professor Musser and his students will apply cutting-edge ultrafast laser-based techniques to a library of optical cavities in order to watch molecules inside move in real time and determine how their motions, which are fundamentally linked to reactive properties, are altered by the light-matter coupling. By isolating the unique dynamics of the polaritons, the team will establish how such photonic structures can be used to redirect molecular photochemistry without having to synthesize new molecules. Their studies could lead to new fundamental understanding of strong light-matter interactions and inspire new developments using polaritons for improved photocatalysts or light-emitting devices. The team will train multiple undergraduates in spectroscopy research and develop middle-school outreach programs focused on the nature of light and light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>A core premise behind the idea of polariton-controlled (photo)chemistry is that strong light-matter coupling distorts molecular potential energy surfaces. This effect has never been detected. This project will use a sensitive ultrafast vibrational technique?impulsive vibrational spectroscopy?to capture the signatures of excited polaritons by launching and tracking coherent vibrational wavepackets on the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces. By incorporating optical control pulses, the team will distinguish any unique polaritonic wavepacket dynamics and infer the associated changes to the potential energy landscape. Comparing these measurements over systematically tuned microcavities, the team will develop empirical guidelines for how to maximize such polaritonic distortions and thereby alter the dynamics of coherent photochemical processes. The results will lay the photophysical foundation and identify the key photonic and materials control knobs to dial in polaritonic effects. This work will open an avenue to develop polaritonic (photo)chemical reactors that exploit light-matter interactions to redirect traditional reaction pathways, creating a valuable resource for the synthetic chemistry community.

A key barrier to many applications, however, is the availability of high-performance photovoltaic cells tailored to these wavelengths of light. Current technologies exhibit insufficient performance and high cost due to material and fabrication limitations. One possible way to address these challenges is to use nanoscale quantum structures in the photovoltaic cell, in a way similar to some commercial photodetectors. This could allow the use of more common materials and reduce some of the losses that limit performance. However, these quantum structures have not been studied in detail for power generation, and a number of open questions exist about how they function and perform. This project will study the fundamental operation of quantum-structured photovoltaic cells, fabricate these types of devices, and measure their performance. This research could have direct impacts in several energy applications, which could help the U.S. reduce reliance on foreign energy sources and improve infrared technologies for a variety of power, communications, and defense applications. This project also seeks to advance the U.S.?s expertise in semiconductor technologies by inspiring students to join the semiconductor workforce and creating new initiatives for graduate and undergraduate students to explore these career options.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: (1) determine the influences of bias and illumination on band structure and carrier transport, and identify design strategies to achieve high carrier collection under forward bias; (2) identify nanophotonic structures to couple IR radiation into the active region of these devices while minimizing parasitic absorption; and (3) fabricate cells with narrow intersubband gaps and demonstrate high energy conversion efficiencies while improving modelling and understanding of transport. The research will utilize a combination of quantum optoelectronic simulations to investigate the band structure and electronic transport under illumination and bias, finite element electromagnetic simulations to design photonic structures for coupling light into the ISPV cell, custom models to predict device performance, epitaxial growth of novel types of conduction band engineered active regions and test samples via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, microfabrication of samples and devices, and detailed material and device characterization using standard and custom spectroscopy, microscopy, and testing equipment. This work will develop a detailed understanding of the relationships between materials, structure, transport, and device performance for an intersubband quantum cascade structure under illumination and in use for electricity generation. Preliminary results indicate that the structure of an intersubband photovoltaic cell is likely to be quite different from a traditional quantum cascade detector, and this research will reveal why these types of structures are different and how an active region should be designed for effective power generation. The combination of experimental and simulation activities and parallel investigation of semiconductor structure and photonic structure will lead to strong platform for future design of scalable and efficient IR energy conversion devices in a variety of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their key predatory role in ocean ecosystems, it is important to understand how they capture prey in order to fully comprehend how they impact ocean food webs. Ctenophores are commonly thought to use sticky cells, called colloblasts, to capture prey. However, previous observations provide strong evidence suggesting that ctenophores use neurotoxic chemicals to anesthetize their prey and that this is the primary mechanism they use to capture and ingest prey. This study will investigate the role of these neurotoxic chemicals for prey capture by ctenophores by quantifying (a) how these chemicals incapacitate prey, (b) how common these chemicals are among different types of ctenophores, and (c) how effective these chemicals are on different types of prey. The project is expected to yield a transformative understanding of the mechanisms behind the remarkable success of a group of seemingly fragile marine predators that are unusually successful at capturing evasive prey. Understanding these toxins may open new opportunities for therapies and drug discoveries. In fact, it is likely this research will introduce a novel class of reversible anesthetic compounds. The nature of the research will foster engagement of many students in marine science, chemistry, and biomedicine.<br/><br/>Ctenophores, dominant marine zooplankton in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, can significantly impact global food webs through top-down control of zooplankton populations. Traditionally, their predatory success was attributed to adhesive cells (colloblasts) used for prey capture. However, new evidence reveals that ctenophores primarily rely on neurotoxic chemicals in their mucus to anesthetize prey, reshaping our understanding of their feeding strategies and prey selection. This project aims to investigate how ctenophore mucus toxins incapacitate prey, toxin prevalence across ctenophore species, and their effectiveness on various prey types. Objectives include: (a) measuring mucus effects on different prey taxa, (b) assessing how mucus influences prey retention and selection in target species, (c) determining the taxonomic distribution of toxic mucus among ctenophores, and (d) exploring the mechanistic basis of prey immobilization via mucus-ion channel interactions. This research is expected to yield a transformative understanding of the mechanisms behind the remarkable success of ctenophores that are unusually successful at capturing evasive prey.

Understanding the drivers of exchange rates is a central objective of international macroeconomics and finance. Exchange rates are key prices affecting the relative cost of imports and exports, as well as the returns to investing in assets abroad. Yet exchange rates have long puzzled economists: they are inconsistent with benchmark models in economics and are very difficult to predict. This project makes progress on these puzzles by exploring the relationship between exchange rates and other international asset prices, such as bonds and stocks in different countries, as well as macroeconomic quantities, such as capital flows across borders. This research helps market participants use exchange rates to better understand macroeconomic conditions in the global economy. It also helps decision-makers better understand how monetary and fiscal policies affect exchange rates and thus the broader economy. The research findings could inspire innovative international policy frameworks, improve the well-being of U.S. households, businesses, and investors, and reinforce the U.S.'s leadership in global markets.<br/><br/>This award project explores exchange rates through the lens of general equilibrium models with international capital market frictions. These capital market frictions are reflected in a central role for global arbitrageurs to intermediate capital flows across borders. Such models thus allow the researchers to accommodate classic forces that have been thought to drive exchange rates, such as the supply or demand for goods, as well as drivers that have been proposed in more recent research, such as changes in the intermediation capacity of global arbitrageurs. The project includes research to decompose the drivers of the dollar exchange rate versus other advanced economies through the lens of such a model. The co-movements of exchange rates with bond yields, spreads in financial markets, and capital flows suggest a nuanced variance decomposition of exchange rates: at high frequencies, shocks to intermediation capacity play an important role in driving exchange rates, but at low frequencies and overall, demand shocks play the most important role. The project includes further research to understand the sources of demand shocks driving variation in these prices and capital flows. The researchers study the co-movements of exchange rates, bonds, and stocks to differentiate between potential sources of demand shocks. The project also includes research to understand how heterogeneous exposures to demand or intermediation shocks can explain differences in exchange rate behavior across countries. The researchers study how patterns in trade linkages and in net foreign assets give rise to heterogeneous effects of these shocks. The project finally includes research on the propagation of macroeconomic policies through exchange rates.  The researchers study whether state-dependence in the effects of foreign exchange rate intervention can account for mixed evidence on its effectiveness in the data. This research could help researchers and decision-makers gain deeper insights into exchange rates and their relationship with international asset prices, capital flows, and other macroeconomic factors, ultimately improving the well-being of the U.S. population and strengthening the country's leadership in international markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In safety-critical domains such as aviation and automotive systems, behaviors of cyber-physical systems are subject to stringent requirements both on safety and performance.  This project seeks to advance control design and run-time performance assurance of such systems.  Providing guarantees on safety and performance is challenging due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of their operating environments of these systems, as well as the need for real-time decision making and adaptation.  Traditional approaches to control design often fall short in handling the complexity of such systems.  There is, therefore, a pressing need for developing new theories, algorithms, and tools that can enable more effective and robust control of complex nonlinear cyber-physical systems. Such advances have the potential to significantly benefit design processes of many systems of societal importance, especially those that are safety critical such as airplanes, as well as manned and unmanned ground vehicles. This project will develop theory and algorithms that will enable efficient and assured design of complex nonlinear systems operating under tight constraints which may significantly reduce the high cost of complex system verification.<br/> <br/> <br/>To achieve these objectives, this project will develop theoretically grounded hybrid hierarchical representations for nonlinear systems that can be used for verification, correct-by-construction control, and learning. The key insight is to lift complex nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear constraints into a hybrid domain with local linearizations, where learning, control design, and monitoring can be done more efficiently. Efficiency will be achieved by 1) defining partial orders among hybrid liftings to enable refinement and improvement of representation accuracy adaptively as needed, 2) developing novel implicit invariant set computation methods for hybrid liftings, 3) developing incremental hybrid lifted model learning techniques that can incorporate physics-based priors and that are complemented with statistical model invalidation methods. The results will be demonstrated with applications in safety critical-control and monitoring of vehicle management systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They likely originated in thermal environments such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents or terrestrial hot springs. There is limited documentation of diversity and ecology of Asgard archaea from hot springs in particular. This project will collect samples of microbes from understudied hot springs in the western U.S. and analyze their genomes. New species of Asgard archaea will be identified and characterized. Data from hot spring samples will be compared with those from other habitats to answer questions of origins. Researchers will also study the evolutionary history of eukaryotic signature genes in archaea. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher, graduate and undergraduate students, and high school interns from local schools. A new undergraduate course will provide students with hands-on research experience in microbial ecology and evolution. YouTube videos of the field and laboratory research will be developed as part of outreach to the broader public on diversity of Asgard archaea. <br/><br/>This project will collect hot spring sediment samples from the western U.S. to recover and identify novel Asgard archaeal lineages. A combination of amplicon, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic sequencing will be performed from DNA and RNA extracted from these samples. Amplicon sequencing will be done using archaeal primers that capture most of Asgard archaeal diversity. Near full-length sequencing of amplicons will result in phylogenetically useful information enabling assessment of diversity and abundance in the hot springs. Metagenomic sequencing using both short and long reads of the most abundant archaeal samples will enable reconstruction of near-complete genomes. Metatranscriptomic sequencing will reveal novel lineages that may have been missed due to PCR bias. Phylogenomic and ancestral state reconstructions with the improved representation of lineages from hot spring habitats will shed light on the origins of Asgard archaea in terrestrial or marine geothermal features. Phylogenetic analysis of the eukaryotic signature proteins found in these archaea will also reveal where the genes encoding these proteins first appeared during geologic time. This research will advance our knowledge of diversity and deep evolutionary relationships of Asgard archaea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some savannas, including Brazil?s cerrado, fire is necessary, helping to maintain open tree canopies and allowing a continuous and highly diverse grass layer to thrive. Exactly how fire should be managed to conserve cerrado biological and functional biodiversity remains unclear, however. This work focuses at the interface of stewardship and research to evaluate how fire is being managed in protected areas in Brazil?s cerrado, whether fire policies are effective for conserving vulnerable fire-dependent cerrado plants, and how fire may be used as a tool to increase cerrado resilience. This work will advance scientific understanding of fire and the maintenance of ecosystem function and biodiversity in savannas, as well as ensuring that Brazil?s national fire policies promote biodiversity and ecosystem function across all of Brazil?s ecoregions. The project will elegantly integrate societal benefits (determination of how well management practices and policies are working) and a variety of training and outreach with cutting-edge research.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the research interrogates a) how a new legal framework in Brazil (Law 12651) allowing for the development of integrated fire management policies in protected areas and on private lands has changed fire regimes in flammable savanna ecosystems, b) whether the policies developed under this framework are appropriate to conserving fire-dependent biodiversity in Brazil?s cerrado, and c) the extent to which cerrado ecosystems and biodiversity are vulnerable in a conservation context and whether fire management can be used as a tool to increase cerrado resilience. To do this, methods will involve combining detailed remote sensing mapping of fire history across cerrado protected areas, intensive site-based work in six protected areas, and mapping of cerrado vulnerability. The six field sites encompass four national parks and two ecological field stations. The work will reach a broad set of participants, including both researchers at Yale and Unicamp and managers at the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservao e Biodiversidade, via a series of participatory management workshops aimed at synthesizing existing fire policy and disseminating information to participants. The managers will gain experience in field work and receive guidance on the importance of fire for biodiversity conservation. The project includes training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates. Altogether, the work will elucidate the interactions between fire, biodiversity, and ecosystems, an issue of growing importance in the Earth system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, organisms are not exclusively at the environment?s whim and mercy. Through their behavior, organisms can dictate their environmental conditions and guide the selective pressures they experience. Consider, for example, a lizard darting into the shade, a mouse digging a burrow, and humans building houses and engineering indoor heating or cooling. This project will test the idea that behavior can shield organisms from natural selection, modify adaptive response, and enhance the exchange of genetic material. The project will focus on anole lizards, a system that provides the variation and replication necessary to isolate the role of behavior in adaptation. The results of this study will provide a new lens on natural selection by illustrating the role that organisms exert over their own adaptive trajectories; all animals - including humans - can use behavior to negotiate their environments. This project contributes to a better prepared STEM workforce through student training. Educational modules will be developed for the undergraduate classroom, providing experiential learning in experimentation, bioinformatics, and statistics. The results from this project will be infused into a museum exhibit in the Yale Peabody Museum, which is free to all visitors and is the most visited landmark by Connecticut schoolchildren. Local educators and scientists will work together in summer workshops to develop educational modules for the museum exhibit that align with state curricula, providing experiential learning opportunities for K-12 students.<br/><br/>Natural selection is a powerful agent of evolution; shifts in temperature across environmental gradients, for example, should favor local adaptation and limit gene flow among populations. Yet, homeostatic behaviors like behavioral thermoregulation (e.g., basking) may buffer organisms from selection, and potentially create corridors for gene flow across environmental gradients. This project will investigate the genetic signatures of thermoregulatory behavior, and test whether homeostatic behaviors circumvent climatic obstacles to dispersal and enhance gene flow across environmental gradients. To do so, this project will leverage the replicated behavioral, physiological, and ecological diversity of anole lizards as an ideal study system. Thermal modification behavior will be quantified through detailed field studies, with preliminary results indicating that lizard species from canopied forests are poor thermoregulators while those from forest edges thermoregulate effectively. The connection between thermal behavior and the phenotype will be quantified by laboratory-based investigation of thermal and hydric physiology, and functional morphology. Preliminary results indicate that thermoregulating lizards exhibit physiological stasis across elevation, while thermoconformers exhibit the expected clinal pattern of local adaptation. Lastly, 3RAD sequencing will be used to infer patterns of gene flow across elevation, and those patterns will be compared among thermoregulators and thermoconformers. Preliminary results indicate that thermoregulating lizards exhibit high rates of gene flow across elevation, suggesting that buffering behaviors shield these animals from selection and facilitate gene connectivity among populations from environmentally dissimilar habitats.

Historical observations have shown that oxygen concentrations are declining in many parts of the oceans, termed ?ocean deoxygenation?. The causes of the decline are linked to changes in surface water temperature and its impact on oxygen solubility, along with variations in the strength of the biological pump, ocean circulation, vertical mixing, ventilation, and biochemical processes. It is difficult to calculate exactly how much ocean oxygen has been lost to the atmosphere and how much has been redistributed within the ocean interior. This project will compare observation-based gridded oxygen datasets with the purpose of generating comparable four-dimensional (space and time) estimates of global oxygen distribution, assessing their similarities and differences and promoting scientific understanding of the drivers of ocean deoxygenation. The project will promote workforce development through support of an early career investigator, a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate interns.<br/><br/>The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the causes of disagreements between different gridded oxygen datasets by conducting an intercomparison of oxygen datasets from common in situ observational and model-based profiles. Many factors can affect estimates of a deoxygenation trend: existing observational studies use different sets of raw data, measurement platforms, data quality control metrics, land-ocean masks, vertical and horizontal grids and interpolation methods. Because variations in any of these factors can lead to different estimates, it is difficult to make direct comparisons and determine the causes of disagreements among datasets. Standardized protocols will be applied to isolate the interpolation method as the only source of discrepancy and to assess uncertainties in global oxygen inventory trends. The second goal is to test hypotheses for the underlying causes of ocean deoxygenation. The suite of new datasets will be used to evaluate the roles of oxygen solubility, the biological pump, and physical and biogeochemical processes driving global ocean deoxygenation. Further, the mechanisms driving the expansion of the tropical ocean oxygen minimum zones will be explored. The use of novel datasets with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution in these analyses will enable new insights into global and regional oxygen content changes. The suite of gridded oxygen datasets will be made available via public data repositories, and the results of the product intercomparisons and deoxygenation analyses will be disseminated via open-access papers. Collaboration with the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group 168 will enhance access and utility of gridded oxygen datasets through sharing and exchange of ideas, experimental protocols and data products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This event is the ninth in a series of conferences, held every eight years since 1961 at the University of Georgia, and will focus on recent developments in geometric topology. Topological spaces are everywhere in mathematics and in fact everywhere in real life. From ordinary 3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time of relativity to spaces of configurations of complex organic molecules and sets of solutions to systems of many equations, the basic problems of topology are ubiquitous.  Geometric topology, in particular, focuses on problems in which a strong visual component of reasoning and problem solving comes into play and is generally the most accessible part of topology for a broad audience.  At the same time it is the realm of topology in which some of the hardest outstanding problems remain unsolved. Recent developments to be highlighted at this conference include, for example, the remarkable results of Watanabe, which show that the set of all symmetries of the simplest 4-dimensional object, the 4-dimensional ball, is drastically more complicated than had been suspected eight years ago.<br/><br/>This conference focuses on the most significant advancements in geometric topology and related geometry since the last Georgia International Topology Conference in 2017.  The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in knot theory, four-manifolds, topology of diffeomorphism and embedding spaces, homotopy theory, contact and symplectic topology and geometry, equivariant Floer homology, Floer homotopy theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic manifolds and dynamical systems. The conference has historically generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD?s. The speakers at various career stages and the range of topics to be presented will offer students and new PhD?s a valuable taste of what the mathematical research community has to offer.

Hybrid seed is a result of cross-pollinating two plant varieties of the same species that differ in their genetic makeup and phenotype traits. These hybrids are selected for genetic configurations that provide favorable phenotype traits or characteristics like higher grain yield, disease tolerance, etc. However, the large-scale conventional production of hybrid seeds by crossing inbred parent lines/varieties is resource- and labor-intensive, making them expensive and placing limitations on their availability and benefits to farmers. This hurdle could be overcome if hybrid crops can be made to reproduce asexually as clones, which will maintain the favorable set of genes and combinations that result in high yields, for example. Recently the technology was developed to produce hybrid rice using the asexual method but it has not yet been successfully adapted to maize, a major crop plant in the U.S.A. In this project, new methods will be developed for maize to maintain the hybrid state of the parent chromosomes in the progeny of hybrid plants. The success of these methods will make possible the inexpensive production of high-yielding hybrid seeds from maize. With the importance of hybrids for maize cultivation, the project is expected to have a large impact on U.S. agriculture.   <br/><br/><br/>Asexual reproduction occurs naturally in many flowering plants by a two-step process called diplosporous apomixis: first, the elimination of genetic segregation during meiosis to make clonal gametes, i.e. egg cells and sperm cells containing unreduced and unrecombined parental genomes, and second, the development of the unfertilized egg cells into embryos to produce clonal plants.   Previously, synthetic apomixis has been successfully achieved in rice, through genetic manipulations that combined the substitution of mitosis for meiosis in gamete cells together with the induction of parthenogenesis, where a plant produces fruits and seeds from unfertilized eggs. In maize, efficient parthenogenesis has recently been demonstrated using the method developed for rice. However, the substitution of mitosis for meiosis has not been successful in maize, due to differences between the function of rice and maize genes involved in the meiosis. This project will develop a novel strategy to generate diploid gametes in maize, based on a hypothesis of conservation of cis-regulatory elements of cell division genes in meiosis and mitosis. The strategy involves editing multiple genes required for cell division and meiosis, as well as the utilization of selected cell division genes from rice.   The methods developed in this project, if successful, could be extended to other major crop plants, and potentially adapted to study other cellular processes in plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Agriculture has greatly benefited from the external application of nitrogen containing fertilizer, which is in large part responsible for current crop yields. Nitrogen use efficiency is a critical agricultural trait that depends on the plant?s ability to efficiently uptake nutrients from the soil and to transport and utilize those nutrients for maximum yields. A plant with improved nitrogen use efficiency will require less fertilizer that will save costs and have less negative results on the ecosystem. The size, shape and responsiveness of root systems are important contributors to how a plant uses available nitrogen. For example, large root systems have been observed to be more efficient at utilizing applied nitrogen, and roots that can rapidly modify their growth and architecture to maximize nitrogen uptake and its associated metabolism can increase the chances of plant survival when nutrients are scarce. Our project will deliver programmed plants with predictable and novel approaches to control root growth in response to nitrogen and to make plants use nitrogen more efficiently. The novel and broadly useful tools developed to engineering plants will also be available for the community.<br/><br/>Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are necessary to ensure high crop yields, but the production and application of fertilizers can disturb ecosystems. In addition, N-fertilizer production is highly energy demanding and cost intensive, representing a major challenge barrier to reliably ensure yield year after year. This project will develop tools to engineer desirable N-responsive traits and investigate their effects on nitrogen use efficiency. Engineered plants will be used to quantify how an enhanced root system contributes to improved uptake and use of externally applied nitrogen. Finally, synthetic optogenetic systems will be deployed to remotely control belowground development via the application of specific wavelengths of light to the plant canopy. All of these approaches will be employed in tomato to determine their effectiveness in a crop species.<br/><br/>This award was funded as part of a lead agency opportunity between NSF, UKRI-BBSRC (UK Research and Innovation - Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Lead) and DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft / German Research Foundation) where NSF funds the US investigator, UKRI-BBSRC funds the UK partner and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, new seedlings are not replacing the trees that have died. These seedlings may need beneficial soil microbes, which have also declined under drought. This project tests this by adding beneficial microbes to pion seedlings planted into areas of experimental severe drought and nearby areas with normal conditions. DNA sequencing will identify the important microbes. Greenhouse experiments will expand this idea across the range of pion pine by comparing seedling growth in soils from sites with different severities of drought. This project will develop new methods to restore pion trees in areas devastated by drought. The seedlings of most tree species rely on beneficial microbes to survive and grow. Thus, results will also inform management of other forests across the US. This project trains graduate, undergraduate, high school students, and local school teachers to allow the research to reach additional participants.<br/> <br/> <br/>Drought is common in the western US and other parts of the world and can lead to tipping points at which ecosystems lose resilience ? the capacity to withstand disruption without a change in function. This research investigates plant-soil feedback as a general mechanism to promote the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems to drought. Experiments leverage a large-scale, historical forest drought experiment to evaluate the hypothesis that positive species-specific plant-soil feedbacks between trees (pion pine) and specialist soil microbes (ectomycorrhizal fungi) increase resilience by benefiting seedling recruitment. Field inoculations and laboratory assays will determine the degree to which recovery hinges on keystone fungi and their functional traits. This project achieves generalization across the geographic range of pion pine with a greenhouse experiment to detect the threshold level of drought that degrades the resilience conferred by plant-soil feedback. This research integrates theory and experiments to promote synthesis across spatial scales that advances understanding of how environmental change disrupts biological interactions and how these interactions influence resilience to environmental change. This project has high potential to broaden understanding of how soil microbes sustain terrestrial ecosystem resilience and to advance use-inspired research through the discovery of practical solutions (soil inoculants) to maximize the resilience of woodlands to drought.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project seeks to understand how cells interpret information related to stress.  Understanding these processes is of significant importance to the scientific community by expanding our understanding of biology and testing this knowledge by building computational models of these processes.  The approaches used to understand these mechanisms also have broader impacts beyond academic research alone.  This includes providing training opportunities both for graduate and undergraduate students interested in careers in STEM fields, cross-disciplinary activities exposing high school students to the integration of data science and biology, and early elementary outreach to demonstrate how microscopy can be used to gain insight into cellular processes and foster interest in STEM.  It is anticipated that the research will impact 100s of students over the duration of the project.  <br/><br/>Within this project, the investigators will examine the mechanisms that cells use to relay information through the stress kinase JNK and transcription factor c-Jun.  Previous studies have shown that JNK activity is highly dynamic but it is unclear how this contributes to gene expression patterns.  The investigators previously determined that different JNK dynamics can give rise to distinct gene expression patterns but it is unclear how these patterns are regulated.  This project will focus on two mechanisms: 1) post-transcriptional regulation of genes through mRNA stability and 2) combinatorial regulation of genes by multiple transcription factors.  The investigators will experimentally measure mRNA decay rates using metabolic labeling.  Live-cell imaging of fluorescent reporters and mutation of 3? UTR sequences will be used to determine how 3? UTR sequences contribute to both mRNA stability and observed gene expression dynamics.  For the second mechanism, the investigators will test how different promoter sequences and transcription factor binding sites contribute to dynamic gene expression over time to explore combinatorial gene regulation.  Systematic deletions of cis-regulatory elements in fluorescent reporters will be used to assess impacts on gene expression dynamics over time.  The collected data from objectives 1 and 2 will be used to refine a computational model of JNK signaling which will be used to facilitate future research into the function of JNK in cells.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project also embeds an education plan to mentor students and support a pipeline of scholars in the US and around the world and thus contribute to the development of future scientific researchers.<br/><br/><br/>This CAREER award funds a research consisting of four experiments to study how market frictions at each step of the agricultural supply chains impedes structural transformation in low-income countries. Project 1 uses an RCT to study the limited pass-through of quality incentives from world markets to upstream coffee producers to identify whether intermediary market power constrain quality upgrading by farmers.   Projects 2 and 3 explore the role of search costs and information constraints in preventing agricultural small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from connecting with exporters and multinational buyers.  Project 4 uses an RCT of an export loan facility to test whether agricultural exporters are constrained by limited ?nance. In all projects, original data collection and administrative data access allow measurement of causal effects on directly impacted ?rms, on competitors and on upstream suppliers. The results of this research project will help to identify policies to improve agricultural markets in low-income countries, hence increase agricultural incomes and accelerate structural transformation as well as enhance the effectiveness of US foreign aid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems contain scatterers, such as impurities or lattice imperfections, which can cause electrons to frequently change directions. The presence of disorder is often unavoidable in complex materials, including quantum materials. Conversely, disorder leads to fascinating phenomena, especially when quantum mechanical effects are important and interactions between the electrons are strong. <br/><br/>The project focuses on two key systems: <br/><br/>1.	The disordered electron liquid: The disordered electron liquid near where a metallic state transforms to an insulator in silicon-based transistors is a system for which the strength of interactions and disorder can be tuned by changing the density of electrons. Depending on the density, the material can either act like a metal at low temperatures, allowing electrons to flow freely, or like an insulator by blocking the electron flow. Despite much effort, the physical mechanisms causing this metal-insulator transition are still under debate. The aim of this project is to derive refined theoretical predictions for the transport of charges and heat on the metallic side of the metal-insulator transition with the goal to enable interpretation of experimental data that can advance understanding of this phenomenon. <br/>2.	Disordered quantum critical metals: The transport of heat in disordered quantum critical metals represents another focus of this project. In these systems, the interplay of disorder and the complex electron motion that arises from strong electron-electron interactions  near a zero-temperature phase transition can cause anomalies in the flow of charge and heat through the material. This research aims to compare charge transport and heat transport in quantum critical metals and to contrast the findings with conventional metals.<br/><br/>The proposed research will advance basic knowledge, and add to our understanding of semiconductors, a class of materials that are of great technological importance.

The disordered electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition is an electron system close to a quantum phase transition, for which the strength of the two main factors, interaction and disorder, can be tuned externally. The physical mechanisms underlying the observed non-monotonic behavior of the resistance on the metallic side of the transition as well as the metal-insulator transition itself are under debate. Progress in the interpretation of the experimental data requires refined theoretical predictions. The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory of transport and thermodynamics near the metal-insulator transition. Thermal transport in disordered quantum critical metals represents another backbone of the project. In these systems, the interplay of disorder and the effective long-range interaction mediated by collective bosonic modes can result in characteristic non-Fermi liquid behavior of transport properties. A goal of this project is to obtain results for the Lorenz ratio, the ratio of thermal and electric conductivities, which is often used to quantify deviations from Fermi-liquid theory observed in experiments. <br/><br/>The main goals of the proposed research are: <br/><br/>1.	Disordered electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition: to derive detailed theoretical predictions for the temperature dependence of the resistance, the thermopower, the specific heat and the spin susceptibility of the disordered two-dimensional electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition. An important aim of this project is the interpretation of experimental findings in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors.<br/>2.	Thermal transport in strange metals: to explore thermal transport in a strange metal described by a two-dimensional generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with potential disorder and spatially random Yukawa coupling. <br/><br/>Both studies will be based on the nonlinear sigma-model formalism for disordered interacting systems.<br/><br/>Deepening knowledge of fundamental mechanisms of thermal transport may help improve energy efficiency in electronic devices. In synergy with the scientific plan, this project includes an education and outreach effort. This includes the development of a new course on mathematical physics tailored to undergraduates, and a K12 outreach activity that will be associated with the University of Alabama high school physics contest.

However, the soft and dynamic nature of their ionic lattice poses considerable challenges in understanding and precisely controlling ferroelectric behavior. In this research project, the research team aims to find new ways to control ferroelectricity in hybrid perovskites using light instead of electricity. By using light, the team will avoid problems caused by the materials? soft structure and unwanted reactions during testing.

Instead, the PI will explore a hypothesis that an optically induced electric field can avoid these issues and allow precise control over crystal structure polarization, paving the way for enhanced dynamic lattice distortion critical for generating ferroelectric polarization. The approach combines novel materials design with advanced spectroscopy tools to uncover metastable polar phases in halide perovskites, stabilizing them at ambient conditions. These transient non-equilibrium polar states, typically absent from phase diagrams, offer opportunities for non-contact manipulation of ferroelectric domains using light. By bridging the gap between transient and long-lived polar phases, the research team will aim to unlock their potential for functional ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and multiferroic applications. This five-year project will focus on probing light-matter interactions in soft dielectric halide perovskites. By stabilizing metastable polar phases and understanding their dynamics, the team will aim to advance the fundamental knowledge of ferroelectric and multiferroic phenomena in these materials system, addressing key challenges in achieving long-lived, stable polarization states under ambient conditions.

The desired surface electronic behavior can be controlled by the types of atoms that are on the surface, and this surface composition can be inhomogeneous or variable.  The project employs simultaneous measurements of surface atomic composition and surface electron motion to understand how to control desired surface electronic behavior via chemical composition.

For example, negatively charged alginates obtained from brown algae are used in food products as thickening and stabilizing agents. Likewise, positively charged chitosan can be found in wound-healing bandages as a blood coagulation agent. The combination of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous media can form polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs). The proposed research investigates the application of electrochemical processes to control the complex formation, a phenomenon not widely reported in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed research will explore how the application of an electric field can cause the adhesion of two oppositely charged ionic gels of polyelectrolytes. The factors that control the properties of PECs, the adhesion between oppositely charged ionic gels, and the disintegration of ionic gels and complexes will be investigated by changing the nature of charged polymers, both of synthetic and natural origin.  The ability to control the properties of PECs will advance their applications in many areas, including biomedical, adhesives, food, and personal care products.  The electric field-induced dissociation of ionic gels can provide pathways for the degradation and reuse of polymer gels. The understanding of the electric field-induced adhesion of ionic gels can be translated into development of adhesives for demanding applications such as biomedical adhesives. The proposed research results will be widely disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and through conference presentations.

The underlying factors that dictate i) the electroformation of complexes of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and their electrodeposition on electrodes through electrochemical processes and ii) the electric field-induced dissociation of ionic gels and adhesion between two oppositely charged ionic gels will be assessed by using state of the art characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks.

The structure of PECs will be determined by using different microscopy and scattering techniques.  For the electroadhesion between oppositely charged ionic gels, how the network properties and applied field in tandem affect the adhesion strength via control of the gel-gel interface will be elucidated. The scientific outcomes of this project will be (i) a new pathway for PEC formation via electrochemical processes and (ii) design principles for adhesives through electroadhesion between oppositely charged ionic gels. Overall, a fundamental structure-property relationship for polyelectrolytes subjected to an electric field will be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rubin is NSF's newest large telescope. It will image the whole sky above Chile every few nights. The telescope makes use of the largest camera ever built. The data will have a profound impact on all areas of astronomy. However, the data will also be negatively affected by LEOs passing through the foreground of the images. This workshop at University of California-Davis will bring together experts to discuss ways in which these impacts can be limited. Modifications to satellite design and operations will be discussed, as will methods for observing and reducing data.<br/><br/>Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image the entire southern sky hundreds of times over a 10-year period, starting in 2025. Rubin is NSF?s flagship optical-infrared (OIR) observatory. The data from this survey are expected to have a profound impact on almost all areas of astronomy. However, the impact on the survey of the growing number of LEOs orbiting the Earth is yet to be fully appreciated. The goal of the meeting is to focus on specific deliverables - implementable engineering parameters and revised strategies for observing and analyzing Rubin data - that will allow satellite operators and observatories to mitigate these impacts. The workshop will concentrate on impacts to Rubin LSST data, using Rubin as the ?bounding case? for astronomy in general. The rapid proliferation of LEO satellites could profoundly affect the future of astronomy by restricting research innovation, limiting funding opportunities, and discouraging future generations of scientists. The proposers will mitigate these effects by collaborating with the satellite industry to seek novel means of coexistence and building lasting relationships that can rapidly react to new challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term goal of this work is to develop iron-catalyzed multicomponent cross-couplings to the level of palladium and nickel-based systems in terms of synthetic applications and mechanistic understanding. The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis and computational chemistry and is well-suited to train the next generation of organic chemists at all levels. In parallel to this research activities, Dr. Gutierrez will continue to evolve initiatives aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by integrating education, research, and outreach through partnerships with the Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering (ADSE), TED-style talks, and expansion of on-going collaborative research and educational programs with the community colleges.<br/><br/>The development of inexpensive, sustainable, and selective catalysts that can directly convert simple chemical ?building blocks? to high-value chiral compounds remains a grand challenge in chemical synthesis. In this vein, there has been surge in the development of new iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions due to iron?s higher abundance in the earth?s crust, lower cost, and less toxic properties in comparison to most transition metal counterparts. However, in contrast to nickel- and palladium-based systems, the use of iron complexes capable of controlling enantioselectivity in catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation remains extremely rare. In this project, the Gutierrez research group will use a mechanistic-driven, multi-technique approach to design and develop asymmetric multicomponent Fe-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving allyl-and alpha-heteroatom bearing radicals.

Therefore, understanding how fish respond to changing environmental conditions is essential to mitigating future human impacts on marine ecosystems. This research effort explores fish evolution and ecology by leveraging microfossil fish teeth and shark scales (together called ?ichthyoliths?) found in deep-sea sediments to evaluate the ecological and evolutionary responses of fish to major transitions in Earth?s history. Ichthyoliths are the most numerically abundant marine vertebrate fossils, as each fish can produce dozens to hundreds of teeth, and a shark may produce tens to hundreds of thousands of scales in its lifetime, presenting the potential for high-fidelity studies of paired biological-environmental records to explore the impact that changing environmental conditions have on fish populations and biodiversity. However, ichthyoliths are extremely small ? most are less than the width of a human hair ? and are typically found separately from the animals that produced them, making these valuable fossils a challenge to work with. This research project will be the first to develop a robust, open-source, and freely available toolkit for ichthyolith studies, combining modern fish biology, machine learning, and high-resolution digital imaging, and then to use this toolkit to explore how fish and sharks responded to several major environmental perturbation events in Earth?s history. This framework will be a transformative tool, allowing for a wide range of research into fish and shark evolutionary and ecological dynamics far beyond the case studies of this research. Finally, this award supports a unique summer research program for undergraduate students to develop skills as researchers and science communicators, providing professional development and unique fully accessible research experiences, while also developing accessible education and outreach materials that will make these small, near-invisible microfossils accessible to a wide audience of K-12 students and the wider public. <br/><br/>The highly robust ichthyolith microfossil record has the potential to unlock fish and shark evolutionary and ecological dynamics going back millions of years on an unprecedented scale. However, these microfossils are typically found in isolation from the animals that made them, making precise taxonomic identification a challenge. Further, their small size and large morphological diversity have been barriers to developing a robust morphological or taxonomic framework for the group, limiting their utility for evolutionary and paleoecological studies. This research will develop a robust taxonomic, ecological, and morphological framework for ichthyolith classification, by leveraging a machine-learning ensemble model-based approach to classify ichthyoliths using a repeatable morphological framework. This framework will be grounded in the modern with a catalog of extant fish species, allowing for taxonomic and ecological identification of different fossil tooth morphologies. Finally, the researchers will use this analytical toolkit to test hypotheses about fish abundance, biodiversity, paleoecology, and evolutionary trajectories across major climate events in Earth?s history including the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary, and the Early Eocene. The framework and toolkits developed through this work will be shared as an open-source, image and morphological database, R package, and online platform to support national and international collaboration on ichthyolith work, providing a common language, analytical toolkit, and structure to support widespread, diverse ichthyolith-based research going forward, unlocking the potential of ichthyoliths to better understand ? and protect ? the fish in our oceans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such structural analysis is essential to help us understand the function (and malfunction) of molecules in complex samples, e.g., biofluids, cells, and tissues.  It is also crucial for the safety of therapeutic biomolecules.  The Hakansson laboratory employs electron irradiation of gaseous, charged biomolecules to yield diagnostic fragmentation.  Depending on their energy, electrons can either be attached or cause detachment of electrons from both cationic and anionic molecules.  While electron attachment to cations, resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD), and electron detachment from anions,resulting in electron detachment dissociation (EDD), are energetically favorable and structurally informative processes that have been relatively broadly applied, including commercial implementations, many questions remain about the underlying mechanisms as well as how these processes can be tuned and how the resulting data should be interpreted.  Electron attachment to anions and electron detachment from cations are less favorable processes; however, the Hakansson laboratory has shown in previous work that negative ion electron capture dissociation; niECD is feasible and shows unique advantages for structural analysis of acidic biomolecules such as phosphorylated and sulfated analytes.  Recent work from the Hakansson group has also shown that electron detachment from cations (tandem ionization) can occur at much lower electron energies than previously demonstrated.  This research is providing new approaches to biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.  Students working on these projects gain exposure to highly interdisciplinary research.  Dr. Hakansson and her group also works to bring appreciation for these concepts and for broader science opportunities to middle school students in an effort to boost interest in the scientific method at an early educational stage.  <br/><br/>Under this award, the Hakansson group will explore electron energy vs. flux effects in positive and negative ion mode on both upgraded Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and beam-type implementations.  This research seeks to elucidate whether ?hot? ECD is not an energy but an electron density effect, tentatively termed electron flux dissociation; EFD.  Resulting spectra are rich in structural information, including amino acid side chain cleavages that can differentiate isomers and carbohydrate cross-ring fragments that provide linkage information for branched analytes.  Similarly, recent reports of internal fragments resulting from two backbone bond cleavages in proteins following electron irradiation do not appear to be a result of ?true? ECD but rather an electron flux effect.  In addition, because internal fragments have many isomeric and isobaric assignment possibilities, false discovery rates are high.  The Hakansson group seeks to elucidate all fragmentation pathways leading to terminal fragments, including hydrogen shuffling, radical a-type ion formation, and accompanying water/ammonia losses that can be erroneously assigned to internal fragments.  In addition, they will explore the role of de-isotoping errors in such assignments.  Furthermore, they will contrast EDD, which shows only two main fragment ion types, to collisional activation, which shows up to eight fragment ion types, with regard to false discovery of terminal and internal fragments from oligonucleotides.  Finally, the Hakansson team will leverage these insights with an eye toward improved alignment of ion-electron reactions with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of labile post-translational modifications and oligonucleotides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much research has focused on the coastal water column, less attention has been given to the importance of the seafloor or sediments of coastal systems. The sediments, however, can recycle nutrients to the water column and support the growth of primary producers such as phytoplankton. In turn these phytoplankton provide food for nutritionally and commercially important shellfish and finfish. The sediments also store carbon and filter excess nutrients from the water column, thereby improving water quality. This project is focused on bringing together a variety of data sources - from observations to modeling results for the Northeast United States. This region was chosen because it is relatively data rich compared to other areas and plays an important role in the US blue economy. A literature review and synthesis will be conducted to gather relevant data, and these data will be evaluated to find patterns of variation. Ocean models will then be used to assess changes across this region that could happen on the short and long-term. Sediment data will also be compared to water column data to see how they are connected, and if their connection is changing over time. This study will engage the scientific community to develop best practice guidelines for sediment data collection and develop community driven priorities for future sediment research studies. The project will provide training for a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher and support workshops for both scientists and stakeholders.<br/><br/>The seafloor plays a major role in influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations, low-oxygen zones in the ocean, and ocean acidity, and represents the only geologic-scale storage of oceanic carbon. The sediments in coastal areas are particularly important as it is estimated that they account for ~70% of ocean carbon burial. Coastal sediments also recycle nutrients to the water column, fueling future water column primary production, and they can improve water quality via nutrient removal. Despite their importance, coastal sediments are poorly sampled relative to the water column, with large spatiotemporal gaps in datasets of nutrients and biogenic gas fluxes. The paucity of coastal sediment flux data leads to incomplete estimates for carbon, oxygen, and nutrient budgets in the ocean. Synthesizing disparate datasets of benthic variables therefore addresses an urgent need to improve the understanding of the role of sediments in the carbon and nutrient cycling in coastal regions at multiple timescales. This effort would further the understanding of mechanisms and environmental conditions influencing benthic dynamics, and consequently the role they play in driving pelagic biogeochemical cycles. The project seeks to do this by focusing on the Northeast US (NE-US), which is a relatively data-rich region. Specifically, existing long-term sediment and water column datasets from the NE-US, model output, and re-analyses will be combined to evaluate the role of different environmental conditions on benthic fluxes of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients. The project will characterize flux patterns in this region, help interpret the larger context these fluxes were observed in, co-locate different benthic fluxes and related variables in space and time to evaluate their relationship to changing environmental conditions, and develop community driven guidelines for data use and future observations. This project will support an early career scientist, one Ph.D. student, and one postdoctoral researcher. Results from this study will be disseminated through publications, presentations at scientific conferences, workshops with stakeholders and public outreach events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop aims to create a dynamic platform where both established and emerging researchers, specializing in infinite-type surfaces and related fields, can come together. This event's goal is twofold: first, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of recent breakthroughs in the field, and second, to explore various avenues for future research and encourage future collaboration. Furthermore, enabling US-based scientists to attend this international meeting has two additional benefits: (1) Allowing for future long term collaborations with researchers outside of the US, and (2) Providing a means to disseminate research and results to the global mathematical community. <br/><br/>Infinite-type surfaces serve as a common thread connecting various areas of mathematics. An infinite-type surface is a two dimensional manifold with ""infinitely much topology,'' e.g. the sphere with a Cantor set of points removed or a surface of infinite genus. They appear in the study of polygonal billiards, topological dynamics, as generic leaves of foliations on compact spaces, in the study of Thompson groups, or in 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. More recently, there has been a significant surge in the study of mapping class groups associated with infinite-type surfaces, also known as big mapping class groups. These are topological groups exhibiting rich phenomenology. As automorphism groups of countable structures, often endowed with well-defined large-scale geometry, they also inhabit the intersection of geometric group theory, model theory, and descriptive set theory. While infinite-type surfaces possess this interdisciplinary nature, historically, only two workshops (in 2013 and 2019) have brought together experts from diverse fields sharing this common theme. Thus, the primary scientific objective of this workshop is to convene a diverse group of mathematicians to facilitate cross-pollination among the different areas converging on infinite-type surfaces.

How do those movers? social statuses and identities shape adaptation and integration experiences after post-disaster population movement? In what ways do movers create meaning in new places of residence, and under what conditions do they remain settled or return to the disaster-stricken place? Answers to these questions are important because they can reveal what elements of a destination place are conducive to long-term settlement, and the conditions under which movers can successfully rebuild their lives after a disaster uproots them. The Principal Investigator (PI) will answer these questions by interviewing post-disaster movers about their experiences recovering and rebuilding their lives after moving to a new place. The PI will locate and interview study participants who were surveyed and interviewed in 2020 after their post-disaster movements, to understand what opportunities and challenges they have encountered in their new communities since these interviews took place. This study advances knowledge and scholarship by using novel longitudinal data to examine how movers rebuild their lives after disaster-induced population movement, focusing on the role of destination places in shaping long-term settlement decisions. Aligned with NSF?s mission, this project addresses the intersection of population movement, disaster response, and social integration to promote societal welfare and scientific progress. Additionally, it promises to benefit society by informing more effective incorporation strategies and support services for movers in disaster-prone areas.<br/><br/>The project focuses on movers after hurricanes compromised their homes in 2017 and beyond. The study explores how demographic characteristics influence movement in order to better understand the relationship between place- and home-making processes and societal incorporation. By re-interviewing a sample of 54 movers, including a sub-sample of return movers, this project will be the first to longitudinally examine post-disaster population movement, capturing not just multi-level factors influencing incorporation and settlement, but return movement and resettlement and factors that shape re-adaptation.

Broader impacts include the development of didactic materials and associated workshops on statistical network analysis, the incorporation of new techniques into undergraduate and graduate coursework, the involvement of undergraduates in research, and the creation of freely available tools for use by government, industry, researchers, and the general public.  The research also will provide foundational techniques of value for business and public decision making applications and directly involves applications to important societal problems ranging from effective communication regarding public safety threats to disaster response.<br/><br/>This research project will develop a new generation of kernel-based techniques for social network analysis.  A problem of central concern for both practitioners and methodologists has been the development of techniques for the identification and characterization of the relationships between exogenous covariates; for example, similarity in personal attributes, geographic proximity, or embeddedness in specific social contexts.  One route to this goal is via the use of kernel learning, a data-efficient machine learning strategy based on the use of functions known as ""kernels"" that capture the similarity between complex data objects.  In a network context, kernels have been most heavily exploited in the field of chemometrics, where kernels for features of small unlabeled and partially labeled graphs representing molecular structures have been used for drug discovery and related applications. This project will build on these ideas and traditional methods in network regression and exploratory network analysis to develop new methods for social network analysis. Core aims of the project include advancing network regression methods using kernel learning, developing new families of kernels for comparative analysis of social networks, and kernel-based extensions of the widely used exponential family random graph modeling framework (a highly generalizable approach to network modeling).

In contrast, in eukaryotes, each nuclear gene has its own regulatory sequence, and each gene leads to a separate transcript encoding a single protein. A few organisms in the animal kingdom show exceptions to this paradigm, and transcripts encoding multiple proteins have recently been found in green algae, which are related to land plants. This suggests that the expression of clusters of genes resulting in transcripts encoding multiple proteins might be more common in the plant kingdom than previously thought. This project uses DNA and RNA sequencing, bioinformatics approaches, and a combination of in vitro and in vitro experiments to explore the presence and functional significance of transcripts encoding multiple proteins among species in the plant kingdom. Plants are the primary producers on our planet, and a better understanding of the mechanisms they employ for gene expression, may enable new approaches for plant breeding. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to engage learners of all ages and increase exposure to STEM disciplines. The education-by-research component of this project will help inspire and train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Recent studies have provided evidence of polycistronic gene expression in diverse green alga, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of polycistronic mRNAs among Chlorophytes. Polycistronic mRNAs in land plants have often been regarded as the result of accidental read-through, and little research has studied the prevalence of polycistronic gene expression across Archaeplastida. This CAREER project aims to determine how widespread polycistronic expression is in Archaeplastida and investigate its functional and evolutionary significance. Research activities will (1) generate a map of the polycistron landscape of key Archaeplastida species using long-read sequencing platforms for whole genome sequencing and poly(A)-tailed RNA sequencing, along with database mining and bioinformatic approaches; (2) study the evolutionary dynamics of polycistronic transcripts through ribosome deep sequencing to assess active translation; and (3) investigate the mechanisms of polycistron translation using in vivo and in vitro assays. These experiments will test the hypothesis that polycistrons are evolutionarily conserved at the structural and functional levels within Archaeplastida. The project integrates an education and outreach program, which includes Science Discussion Seminars and training in all aspects of research. It also includes science demonstrations, hands-on activities, and the development of educational materials for K-12 students and the public.

While much research has focused on the coastal water column, less attention has been given to the importance of the seafloor or sediments of coastal systems. The sediments, however, can recycle nutrients to the water column and support the growth of primary producers such as phytoplankton. In turn these phytoplankton provide food for nutritionally and commercially important shellfish and finfish. The sediments also store carbon and filter excess nutrients from the water column, thereby improving water quality. This project is focused on bringing together a variety of data sources - from observations to modeling results for the Northeast United States. This region was chosen because it is relatively data rich compared to other areas and plays an important role in the US blue economy. A literature review and synthesis will be conducted to gather relevant data, and these data will be evaluated to find patterns of variation. Ocean models will then be used to assess changes across this region that could happen on the short and long-term. Sediment data will also be compared to water column data to see how they are connected, and if their connection is changing over time. This study will engage the scientific community to develop best practice guidelines for sediment data collection and develop community driven priorities for future sediment research studies. The project will provide training for a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher and support workshops for both scientists and stakeholders.<br/><br/>The seafloor plays a major role in influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations, low-oxygen zones in the ocean, and ocean acidity, and represents the only geologic-scale storage of oceanic carbon. The sediments in coastal areas are particularly important as it is estimated that they account for ~70% of ocean carbon burial. Coastal sediments also recycle nutrients to the water column, fueling future water column primary production, and they can improve water quality via nutrient removal. Despite their importance, coastal sediments are poorly sampled relative to the water column, with large spatiotemporal gaps in datasets of nutrients and biogenic gas fluxes. The paucity of coastal sediment flux data leads to incomplete estimates for carbon, oxygen, and nutrient budgets in the ocean. Synthesizing disparate datasets of benthic variables therefore addresses an urgent need to improve the understanding of the role of sediments in the carbon and nutrient cycling in coastal regions at multiple timescales. This effort would further the understanding of mechanisms and environmental conditions influencing benthic dynamics, and consequently the role they play in driving pelagic biogeochemical cycles. The project seeks to do this by focusing on the Northeast US (NE-US), which is a relatively data-rich region. Specifically, existing long-term sediment and water column datasets from the NE-US, model output, and re-analyses will be combined to evaluate the role of different environmental conditions on benthic fluxes of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients. The project will characterize flux patterns in this region, help interpret the larger context these fluxes were observed in, co-locate different benthic fluxes and related variables in space and time to evaluate their relationship to changing environmental conditions, and develop community driven guidelines for data use and future observations. This project will support an early career scientist, one Ph.D. student, and one postdoctoral researcher. Results from this study will be disseminated through publications, presentations at scientific conferences, workshops with stakeholders and public outreach events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A microservice architectural approach is used to develop software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. The challenge comes when these systems evolve. System developers can foster expertise in individual microservices and their specific domains, but problems can occur when changes impact other microservices. Developers quickly lose track of microservices dependencies. This solution addresses these challenges in microservice architecture maintainability and quality by providing just-in-time insights into the architectural impact of changes. The goal is to provide change impact analysis of cloud-native systems alongside quality assurances to improve system evolvability and reliability.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of change impact analysis of cloud-native systems alongside quality assurance. The solution uses static code analysis tailored to distributed, component-based development to enable holistic reasoning and reduce change impact propagation issues. Improperly managing change impact may lead to costly errors during development, including increased communication overhead and delays. Improper management also results in challenges in identifying and addressing the impacts. The technology addresses a critical need for solutions capable of operating across multiple microservice codebases, supporting developers with change impact analysis to prevent inconsistencies and production errors in the system. This tool is designed to automatically generate a comprehensive system representation overview (intermediate representation) by analyzing codebase artifacts, offering practitioners insights into the potential impacts of individual changes on the system-wide interconnected components. In addition, the tool is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing development and operations pipelines, serving as a quality assurance checkpoint at each stage of system changes.

Agricultural practices could be improved by using biotechnology to manipulate crop traits or to replace expensive pesticides with plant-produced, affordable compounds. However, both approaches require engineering multiple genes or pathways to yield predictable outcomes. Thus far, predicting the expression in plants of synthetic genes and pathways, even those composed of well-characterized DNA sequences, remains a major challenge. Indeed, when individual pathway genes are assembled into larger designs, their performance becomes unpredictable because regulatory elements and genic regions that encode proteins show strong context-dependent properties. Moreover, plant biotechnology relies on only a handful of regulatory elements, often of bacterial and viral origin, that constitutively and ubiquitously drive gene expression, interfering with growth and reducing crop yields. This lack of programmable and tunable regulatory elements contributes to unpredictable gene expression through expression interference and silencing. Together, the results of this study will enable the construction of multi-gene cassettes in which the expression of each gene is induced in response to a specific stimulus and at a specified level to produce optimal pathway flux. These efforts will generate large numbers of programmable and tunable regulatory elements and combinations of elements for future synthetic biology efforts in plants. Beyond transgenes, the ability to ?program? plants with predictable expression characteristics will deliver breakthroughs in manipulating endogenous pathways that control plant growth and yields, thereby making feasible the targeted engineering of resilient and high-yielding crops. <br/><br/>This project exploits a toolbox of novel experimental and computational strategies pioneered by  this interdisciplinary collaborative team to make plant gene expression predictable by constructing programmable and tunable multi-gene cassettes that produce antifeedants and insect pheromones as alternatives to traditional pesticides.

Variation in how selective females are, termed choosiness, is common. Choosiness shapes which males' genes enter the next generation and plays a key role in speciation. However, despite its central role in numerous evolutionary processes, basic questions about variation in choosiness and its genomic basis remain poorly understood. Using crickets as a study system, this project aims to examine whether females differ reliably in their choosiness for male song and how much of those differences among females reflect their genetics. Using gene expression and genetic mapping experiments, this project also aims to identify candidate genes underlying variation in choosiness. One of the broader impacts of this project explore the use of alternative tools (dance) for teaching animal behavior to college and K-12 students as a complement to typical written and spoken approaches.<br/><br/>Choosiness describes how discerning an individual is in mate choice, and the dramatic differences animals demonstrate in choosiness has major implications for selection and speciation. Yet our understanding about variation in choosiness remains poor compared to our understanding of which traits are favored. This imbalance hinders our ability to answer crucial questions about individual differences and whether reinforcement selection could impact choosiness. This project focuses on crickets, in which pulse rate of the male song and female preference for pulse rate are species-specific and under natural selection. The proposed work will estimate intraspecific variation in choosiness for song pulse rate, examine whether there is repeatable individual variation in choosiness, and understand its relationship with variation in other preference traits.

Oxygen levels vary naturally throughout the world?s oceans, so it is not known whether the ability of these organisms to consume methane is disrupted in some places. Custom one-of-a-kind instruments to measure methane consumption rates and monitor what organisms are present have been built by the investigators. The instruments will be sent to the bottom of the ocean for weeks and in different locations. The goal is to see how methane oxidation and the types of organisms present adjust to different oxygen concentrations and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>Natural gas seeps along the continental margins inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying waters. This methane is largely oxidized by microbes. Although microbial methanotrophs are largely microaerophilic, it is not known how differences in oxygen concentrations enhance or hinder their ability to respond nor whether methane consumption rates are controlled by deep-sea oxygen concentrations. Recent work has shown that microbial aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the deep sea occurs with widely varying rate constants. The project is to explore factors that drive this variation by making in situ measurements of MOx and microbial community dynamics at known seep sites offshore Louisiana, an area with frequent episodic methane releases, and on the Cascadia Margin offshore Oregon where highly variable bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) will provide vital evidence for how oxygen limitation affects MOx in situ. The in situ measurements are possible due to newly-developed benthic landers that can make MOx rate measurements on timescales of hours to weeks using advanced laser methane and optode DO sensors. An in situ collection and incubation scheme allows collection of microbial time-series, tracking the relative abundance of methanotrophs (through 16S rRNA surveys and metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) to study methanotrophic responses to varying ambient conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, the ability to deploy security-related software updates is now considered essential to guarantee a device's security. Unfortunately, in many scenarios, such as devices running legacy applications for which the source code is unavailable, reliably creating, deploying, and verifying software updates remains challenging. As a result, many devices are left unpatched, even when known to be vulnerable to security weaknesses. To address this issue, this project will develop a principled and comprehensive methodology for developing, deploying, and verifying software patches. In particular, this work will ease software patching in scenarios where the original software source code is unavailable, allowing the deployment of security patches in millions of devices currently left unpatched. Additionally, this project will produce educational materials and conduct security competitions to develop and assess software patches. <br/><br/>To achieve its goals, this project will start by developing differential binary-analysis techniques to compare original and patched binaries, focusing on the modifications introduced by the patch. These techniques will then be used to efficiently assess the security enhancements introduced by a patch while detecting potential unintended side effects. In parallel, the project will develop reliable approaches to patch binary code at scale. Finally, the project will implement tools to generate human-readable representations of patch modifications to aid analysts in understanding the impact of patches and to update Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). Collectively, these efforts will establish a comprehensive, human-in-the-loop pipeline for defining, generating, and verifying software patches at the binary level, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of current and future software systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This solution seeks to address the lack of accurate, real-time muscle monitoring, which is critical for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, athletes, and those recovering from injuries. In the United States, approximately 7 million people suffer from neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson?s and Alzheimer?s diseases, while over 30 million individuals participate in organized sports, where injuries like strains and sprains are common and often result in significant recovery time and healthcare costs. The benefit of this approach is improved accuracy in detecting muscle fatigue and strain, enabling healthcare professionals, athletes, and individuals to take proactive steps in preventing injuries and managing neuromuscular conditions. This innovation has the potential to provide multiple benefits by enabling healthcare professionals, coaches, and individuals to detect early signs of muscle-related conditions, improve rehabilitation outcomes, reduce medical expenses, enhance sports performance, and promote healthier lifestyles by preventing injuries. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced wearable patch that provides real-time, precise data on muscle strain and exertion levels.

As a result, the ocean iron cycle is closely tied to the ocean carbon cycle. Progress in understanding the ocean iron cycle has been slower than for some other elements because it is present at very low concentrations and care must be taken to avoid contaminating samples. The international GEOTRACES program has, over the last twenty years, greatly accelerated progress in marine iron geochemistry. Capabilities have also been developed for measuring the stable isotopic composition of iron in seawater. In this project, a team of researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Hawaii will measure iron isotopes in samples from three GEOTRACES expeditions in the Pacific Ocean. This will produce an unprecedented data set for iron isotopes. Combining these data with ocean biogeochemical modeling, the team will address important questions about the sources of iron to the ocean and about biological cycling of iron. The project will support several early-career scientists, including postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students at each institution. Project data will be made publicly available through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office and in GEOTRACES data products.<br/><br/>Iron plays an essential role in driving oceanic biogeochemical cycles and is thought to limit phytoplankton growth over large regions of the surface oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, where primary productivity mediates deep ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange, and the eastern Equatorial Pacific, where iron feeds a highly productive ecosystem. Deep iron sources are key to the marine iron cycle, especially in the deep Pacific Ocean where hydrothermal venting from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has been suggested to supply dissolved iron to the Southern Ocean via upwelling. However, key questions remain about sources, longevity/speciation, and transport of this dissolved iron. Samples have been collected during two GEOTRACES zonal sections, from South America to Australia along 10S (GP21 in 2021) and Ecuador to Papua New Guinea along the Equator (GP11 in 2023). Samples are also available from one GEOTRACES-compliant cruise (GPc03) in the western subtropical Pacific. Using a combination of state-of-the-art iron isotope measurements and biogeochemical modelling, the team will address the following questions: 1) Using iron isotopes as a tracer, what is the relative supply of dust, sediment, and hydrothermal-derived iron to different regions of the shallow ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre and Equatorial upwelling zone, and how does iron supply vary in space and time? 2) How do microorganisms fractionate iron isotopes as they take up iron? How does the extent of this fractionation relate to the (temporally and spatially variable) nutrient limitation regimes and the degree of upper ocean iron recycling in the Equatorial-South Pacific? 3) What is the flux, isotope signature, and location of dissolved iron supplied to Pacific Deep Waters (PDW) by hydrothermal venting along the EPR and the Tonga/Kermadec arc? What are the stabilization mechanisms, isotopic changes, and longevity of this dissolved iron with transport? How do dissolved iron and iron isotopes evolve in PDW as it travels southward along the coast of South America and into the Southern Ocean? The results are expected to transform understanding of this essential micronutrient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently been shown that the rare 17O isotope provides additional information, but unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure with sufficient precision. A revolutionary laser spectroscopy system was developed for measuring 17O in the last several years. It is easy to use, costs less than traditional mass spectrometers and is more rapid than traditional mass spectrometry. It is truly a ?game changer? for isotope analyses. There are several limitations to this new method however. It is proposed here to develop a method where the traditional N2 carrier gas is substituted with N2O. This allows the sample to be frozen out of a vacuum line at liquid nitrogen temperatures, and therefore easily transferred in a vacuum line. If the system works as expected, sample size will be reduced by an order of magnitude, analytical precision should double and analysis time will be reduced. University of New Mexico personnel will work with the laser manufacturer, Aerodyne Research Inc. in an academic-industry collaboration to perfect the N2O system. The new instrument will be an integral part of the research of three Ph.D. students and serve as instrumentation for several undergraduate senior-honor?s theses. It is expected that this relatively simple instrument will become the standard method for analyzing triple oxygen isotope ratios.<br/> <br/>Laser-based spectroscopy (TILDAS) is a straightforward, rapid and accurate method for determining triple oxygen isotope ratios (d18O, D?17O) of CO2 gas. Sample preparation and laser analysis are straightforward, however, the system requires a precisely diluted sample of ~450 ppm CO2 in an optically transparent carrier gas (N2 or CO2-free air) which involves a sophisticated interface. Gas mixing takes close to 30 minutes, and aliquots of the sample gas are pumped away after each measurement, limiting ultimate precision. Here it is proposed to substitute a liquid nitrogen condensable gas (N2O) in place of N2. Being able to freeze out the sample will lead to 1) rapid mixing times, doubling the throughput rate, 2) smaller sample requirements to as low as 14 micrograms calcite equivalent and 3) increased precision due to repeatable analysis of the same sample gas. It will significantly expand the reach of triple isotopes. Initial test results are very promising (d18O 0.03?; d17O 0.05 ?, D?17O 60 per meg, 1s), but further improvements require additional modifications to the TILDAS system. The inlet system will be redesigned and collaborations with Aerodyne Research Inc. will improve the analysis software and interface to develop an automated N2O based system that can be used for triple isotope analysis of CO2 gas, carbonates, water, soil water, leaves, blood, etc. This will be the primary research effort of a Ph.D. student working closely with the principle investigator. Results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and work with the laser manufacturer will result in the system available to new users.

Over the past 30 years, scientists have discovered renewable nanomaterials?tiny particles made from common, renewable resources like wood and crops. These materials combine the benefits of advanced technology with sustainability and safety, offering potential solutions to global challenges. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), which are tiny, rod-shaped particles, are an example of renewable nanomaterials. CNCs can naturally form strong, color-producing structures, which have potential uses in products like coatings, textiles, and electronic devices. However, the exact factors that control how CNCs assemble and create colors are not yet well understood. This research focuses on studying how different surfaces and drying conditions affect the assembly of CNCs. By uncovering these details, this project seeks to create sustainable colors and materials, leading to innovations like smart windows, anti-corrosion coatings, and even semiconductors. This project also includes a significant educational component that focuses on engaging college students, middle-school teachers and the public in science, technology and sustainability. This project specifically fosters interdisciplinary educational opportunities, involving hands-on learning, research experience, peer-teaching and mentoring, and partnerships between academia, local schools and communities. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER program is to develop a scientific foundation and an interdisciplinary, inclusive education platform to harness the self-assembly of renewable nanoparticles on solid surfaces for the controlled design of advanced sustainable materials and bio-inspired colors. Of particular interest are cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), plant-based nanoparticles that spontaneously self-assemble in aqueous suspensions to form chiral nematic structures at critical concentrations. These helicoidal structures achieve an arrested state which may be characterized as strong, color-generating nanostructures as a result of drying the colloidal state into a coating or a film (a process referred to as EISA or evaporation-induced self-assembly). The substrates onto which the dispersions dry are hypothesized to critically influence the self-assembly of CNCs, which in turn controls the generated visible colors. This program, therefore, aims to (1) elucidate the role of mounting substrate effects on the assembly and anchoring of these CNCs and (2) investigate the influence of drying dynamics on EISA, known to primarily govern color generation. A series of mounting substrates of varying surface properties and topography is used to investigate the deposition of CNC mono- and multilayers and assess the influence of substrate properties and external drying conditions on the drying dynamics of CNC cholesteric structures and the formation of colors. The outcomes of aims (1) and (2) are to be integrated into a novel interdisciplinary, multi-generational educational platform that will train the next generations of leaders in bio-inspired and sustainable colors for materials design and innovation. This platform will also aim to (3) develop a globally competitive STEM workforce to increase the engagement of younger generations from all backgrounds and the broader public in science, technology and sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living organisms employ ions to transmit sensory signals, store information in memory, and convert chemical energy into work. These functionalities often involve ions in confined aqueous environments. In biological systems, ion transport occurs through channels, proteins, and membranes, where the confined geometries enable enhanced responsiveness to stimuli. Within cellular environments, these stimuli are self-generated by changes in local ionic and molecular compositions. <br/><br/>The team hypothesizes that the response of ions to external stimuli in artificial channels and synthetic confined morphologies can be used to emulate neuronal functions, such as information signaling and processing. To explore this, they aim to investigate the mechanisms by which information and energy are transferred via ionic structural changes and motion in confined environments. Ionic motion in solutions is typically driven externally by electric fields (electro-osmosis) or ionic concentration gradients (ionic diffusion-osmosis) and is strongly influenced by geometry and surface properties. Surface-induced electro-osmosis and ionic diffusion-osmosis occur when electric fields or gradients are self-generated due to non-uniform surface properties. These properties include spatially varying chemical activity, ion fluxes, and structural asymmetries, such as irregular charge distributions or asymmetric geometries. <br/><br/>The supported research will focus on developing theoretical, numerical, and computational approaches to design and analyze both externally driven and surface-induced ionic flows in confined systems, with an emphasis on understanding the roles of surface and geometric effects.  The goal will be to uncover the mechanisms underlying ionic signaling to enable the design of ionic systems capable of storing and transferring information, mimicking brain-like functionalities. This research has the potential to lay the foundation for the development of ionic machines?soft, adaptive materials that encode and process information using ionic currents. Additionally, the team is committed to educating students and postdocs in this emerging interdisciplinary field, which has immense technological relevance and promises to drive innovations in futuristic applications.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at improving our understanding of ion transport in spatially-confined, electrically-charged environments. The team will attempt to design biomimetic materials that perform information and energy transference in nanochannels using ions as charge carriers. They will develop molecular simulations and continuum theory to determine the relationship between memory effects and ionic microstructures in the transport of ions. They will employ classification schemes to assess the system's ionic clustering conditions, topology, and time evolution required to produce non-linear and time-dependent ionic conductivities. These features are essential to create memory effects. The team will also explore the mechanisms to modify ionic conductivity in nanochannels by considering polarizable surfaces of various geometries and the impact of direct and time-dependent biasing electric fields. There are currently no efficient computational methods to address surface polarization effects on strong confinement by topologies other than flat. To develop ionic signals' information transference and processing paradigms, the team will develop computational methods to investigate ionic currents at pore boundaries and non-symmetric structures. They will also develop analytical models and numerical methods to analyze the combined effect of ionic fluxes with charge patterns in surface-induced electro-osmosis and ionic diffusion-osmosis.  The supported research will answer fundamental questions about information transference, signaling, and key biophysical processes. It will provide a physical understanding of molecular interactions in nano- and micro-sized confinement of charge-containing systems. In doing so, it will aid the design of new materials for various applications, including water desalination, ion separation, and blue energy harvesting. <br/><br/>This award will impact diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, and materials science, by employing the results of the supported research to interpret experimental measurements and design new functionalities.

These connections are adaptable, supporting learning and memory, while also remaining stable to ensure proper brain function. The extracellular matrix, a network of molecules surrounding synapses, plays a critical role in maintaining this balance. This investigation explores how changes in this matrix affect synapse stability and, consequently, the brain?s ability to function effectively. This work is vital because disruptions in synapse stability are linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and Alzheimer?s disease. By uncovering the mechanisms that preserve brain connectivity, we aim to inspire new strategies for addressing these challenging conditions. This project goes beyond scientific discovery to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists, contributing to our nation?s leadership in science and technology. Through engaging educational initiatives, we provide hands-on STEM experiences, focusing on providing opportunities for all. A highlight of our outreach includes LEGO-based microscopes, which combine creativity and science to make microscopy accessible and fun for all ages. Additionally, we integrate art and science, encouraging students to explore scientific concepts through creative expression. Our mission is to equip students with the tools and inspiration to excel in STEM and drive societal progress.<br/><br/>Synaptic connections between neurons are essential for brain function, balancing adaptability for information processing with stability to maintain circuit integrity. Homeostatic plasticity ensures neural circuits remain adaptive within physiological limits, yet its molecular pathways are poorly understood. Disruptions in homeostatic signaling contribute to excitation-inhibition imbalances implicated in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Alzheimer?s disease. The extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides structural support and serves as a reservoir for signaling molecules, plays a critical but understudied role in regulating synaptic function. This research focuses on how the ECM maintains synaptic stability through dynamic regulation by matrix metalloproteinases. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we identified Drosophila Multiplexin (Dmp), a homolog of mammalian Collagen XVIII, as a key regulator of homeostatic plasticity.

Its aim is to bring together researchers in Poisson geometry, foliation theory, and representation theory to study an array of questions related to singularity theory in the Poisson setting. The program will feature surveys on three of the most active topics in this area, followed by research talks, a series of open discussions, and several events designed to promote the engagement of early-career participants. The goal of these activities is to introduce the participants to new mathematical perspectives on Poisson singularity theory, and to create an opportunity for new interdisciplinary collaborations. The purpose of this award is to support the participation of US-based researchers in this international event.<br/><br/>The rich geometric behavior of Poisson spaces around singular points, where the rank of the Poisson bivector drops, is governed by a subtle interplay of geometric and algebraic phenomena. The workshop will focus on three interrelated problems in Poisson singularity theory: normal form theorems, deformations, and desingularization. The surveys and talks will address these problems as they occur in an array of geometric settings, including differential geometry, foliation theory, holomorphic geometry, the theory of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, algebraic geometry, and geometric representation theory. It will give participants an opportunity to apply current methods in one discipline to open problems in another, fostering a new dialogue around singularities in Poisson geometry.

Although chemists have long known that both the electron spin and charge are important for making and breaking chemical bonds, considerations of the electron charge has dominated past studies in electrochemistry. Recent work on water splitting, as well as a few other reactions, show that the electron spin can significantly impact reaction selectivity and reaction efficiency. Waldeck will develop new methods to deliver spin-filtered electron currents to conventional achiral catalysts and will use them to study how the electron spin affects electrocatalytic reactions. Success of this research program promises to introduce a new tool for examining electrochemical reaction mechanisms and for improving the selectivity of electrochemical reactions. The fundamental scientific outcomes of this project have potential impact beyond electrochemical water splitting, with relevance to other processes involving spin transport and new mechanistic views of catalytic reactions. The graduate, undergraduate, and high school students involved in the project will be trained in unique aspects of electrochemistry and engage in a consortium of research groups involved in chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) research.<br/><br/>With support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor David Waldeck of the University of Pittsburgh will leverage the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, which states that the transmission of electrons through a chiral material depends on their spin, to create spin-filtered electron currents for electrochemistry studies.  Waldeck?s team will create heterostructured catalyst scaffolds, which possess an intermediate chiral ?spin transport layer?, to control the population of electron spins at the catalyst surface. In this way, they will examine how the electron spin affects multi-electron redox reactions and enantioselective oxidation reactions. For multielectron reactions, they will examine whether (and how) the orientation of the electron spins with respect to each other affects the distribution of chemical products. In enantioselective chemical reactions ? a type of reaction that produces chiral molecules with a particular handedness ? they will study how the electron spin can be used to spin-polarize the electron clouds of chemical intermediates and direct the chemical reaction toward one ?molecular handedness? over the other.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The understanding of network biology may enable the rapid design and development of a high number of therapeutic programs and their commercialization with high predictability.

Current treatments focus on single targets, providing variable therapeutic effects. What is advanced here is the opposite approach: reprogramming molecular networks to produce safe, profound and consistent therapeutic effects. Specifically, transcription factors (TFs) are dominant proteins controlling all gene expression and cell fate. Because TFs act in networks, algorithms are built to map TF networks and identify the TFs controlling diseased networks. Oligo-based drugs will be developed with the unique ability to inhibit multiple TFs to drive therapeutic effects beyond single target approaches.

Moreover, instead of conventional inductive-based energy processing, we will leverage the increased energy density of capacitors to decrease passive component size and switch stress. These approaches result in a framework of condensed buck-boost converters capable of dramatically increased power density and efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions, enabling greater integration of renewable energy systems and improving drivetrains for future electrification of transportation.

They allow detailed investigations of phenomena at time and<br/>length scales difficult to observe directly.  In particular for complex systems such as the human brain, they have become<br/>indispensable for testing hypotheses and making predictions for experiments.  Cognitive phenomena such as learning and memory evolve<br/>on timescales from minutes to years, while the underlying processes on the level of individual nerve cells involve milliseconds timing.<br/>Bridging these timescales in computer simulations requires significant computational resources.  This project develops a new hardware system<br/>specifically designed to meet the increasing computational demands arising for increasingly sophisticated multi-scale brain models.  This<br/>new tool will both support fundamental neuroscience research and accelerate the translation of insights into biological computation<br/>into novel computing devices for commercially relevant applications. While the project focuses on computational neuroscience models, the<br/>implementation challenges and proposed solutions are applicable to the simulation of a broad class of dynamical systems such as power grids,<br/>financial markets, and epidemics.  Finally, this project will support the continuous development of open-source workflows for the design of<br/>asynchronous digital hardware.<br/><br/>Despite tremendous progress in recent decades, the biophysical mechanisms and computational principles underlying memory and learning<br/>in the brain remain poorly understood.  Due to the complexity of biological systems and the difficulty in reproducibility (in the<br/>engineering sense) of results, researchers rely on computational models to test hypotheses and to make experimental predictions.<br/>Modern models of neuronal computation and learning are formulated in continuous-time with continuous interactions, i.e., as systems of<br/>ordinary differential equations.  Yet, these are a poor fit for existing accelerators which are optimized for either continuous time<br/>with discrete (spiking) interactions or discrete time with continuous interactions.  A significant implementation challenge on the path to a<br/>scalable accelerator lies in efficient parallelization of the spatially discrete, non-locally and non-uniformly coupled systems of<br/>equations, in particular due to the communication requirements arising from continuous interactions in continuous time. To overcome these<br/>challenges, we propose a convergent simulator architecture that can accelerate continuous-time models of learning using neuromorphic<br/>hardware principles.  On the algorithmic end, we exploit the insight that continuously interacting systems do not necessarily require dense<br/>communication, i.e., that communication in implementations of these dynamics can be both sparse and adaptive to computational demand.  The<br/>resulting algorithms are ideally suited for implementation in asynchronous digital hardware with fine-grained parallelism and share<br/>similarities with existing neuromorphic computing approaches.  To validate our approach and ensure its usefulness to the scientific<br/>community, we create both an FPGA implementation and silicon prototype for a recently proposed cortical learning model and develop novel<br/>model variants for processing and learning across long time scales.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through engagement with the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation (IMSI), the project will cultivate research collaborations in machine learning (ML).  Primary goals are: (1) formalize a partnership between A&M-SA and IMSI, including the PI's participation in the Spring 2025 long program on Uncertainty Quantification and Artificial Intelligence for Complex Systems, (2) advance the PI's scholarship and undergraduate training through research opportunities, curriculum development, and dissemination of content material in SciML.  The project will transform the instructional and training ecosystem at A&M-SA especially supporting SciML.  The PI would be building strong computational and coding skills for undergraduate students to be competitive in the marketplace and ready to join the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The project's first research thrust is ML-enhanced iterative coupling of complex local-to-nonlocal (LtN) problems. While local problems enjoy computational feasibility, they lose their effectiveness when dealing with challenging physics such as fracture.  In numerous applications, fracture is localized in a region.  This is where a nonlocal method such as peridynamics (PD) should take over to capture the physics, nonetheless with heavy computational cost. This is the rationale of LtN coupling. Hence, coupling approaches will make such problems computationally realistic and feasible.  The project?s second research thrust is the peridynamic differential operator (PDDO)-enhanced ML approaches to solve complex fluid flow problems. PDDO enables numerical differentiation through integration by converting differentiation to its nonlocal PD (integral) form.  It maintains the ability to use partial differential equations for modeling while treating discontinuities seamlessly in an integral representation.  Its strength lies in capturing sharp gradients, even gradient singularities.  The performance of existing physics guided ML approaches may degrade in the presence of sharp gradients.  This can be remedied by incorporating nonlocal interactions into the neural network input together with local space and time variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How the nervous system changes to allow for stage-appropriate behaviors is a central question in neuroscience, with connections to neurological disease and mental health. Many behaviors specific to adults arise after a period of maturation, e.g., puberty, when a juvenile transforms into an adult. The nervous system transforms drastically during this time, including the birth of new cells that build the circuits for adult behaviors. Across the animal kingdom, juvenile neurons have been reported to reprogram during maturation and contribute to circuits for adult-specific behaviors by poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The lag in our understanding is due in part from the technical challenges in identifying developmentally reprogrammed neurons in the first place. This project leverages a powerful system to study maturational reprogramming of neurons at cellular and molecular level. This investigation will test the hypothesis that development can use the same neurons to construct a variety of neural circuits whose use is specific to different sexes and stages of life. The project will offer immersive neuroscience and biomedical training for undergraduates, master?s students, and postbaccalaureate researchers before pursuing a PhD in neuroscience or related fields. Undergraduate students in an investigative neurobiology course will also engage in hands-on lab experiences, contributing directly to ongoing research. <br/> <br/>In Drosophila, sex-specific behaviors, like mating, develop when juvenile larvae metamorphose into adults. Prior studies identified a small population of interneurons in the adult female nerve cord, the DDAG neurons, that influence many aspects of female fertility. These neurons are born during embryogenesis and exist as mature interneurons in larvae of both sexes. During metamorphosis, the juvenile counterparts of the DDAG neurons acquire sex-specific identity, apoptose in males, and reprogram in females for mating functions. The circuits for reproductive behavior in flies are thus partially built from developmentally reprogrammed neurons with former activities in sex-agnostic juvenile larvae. This project will use the DDAG neurons to study the developmental and molecular mechanisms that reprogram neurons during maturation. The work will (1) determine how different subtypes of DDAG neurons in adults contribute to female behavior and elucidate the larval counterparts of each DDAG subtype and their functions in larvae; and (2) uncover the molecular mechanism that reprograms the DDAG neurons during metamorphosis. This investigation will test the hypothesis that two segmentally repeating neuronal subtypes in larvae that regulate locomotion reprogram to five adult subtypes with different functions in female mating. Further, the study will test the hypothesis that a transcription factor program present in the larval counterparts of these neurons reprograms them in response to a permissive metamorphic hormone. Taken together, this project will provide transformative insights into the mechanisms that govern the reprogramming of juvenile neurons during maturation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely acknowledged that users of all languages know both specific facts about their language (e.g., word-specific patterns), and know general rules of their language that they use to adapt to new linguistic situations (e.g., new words they have not heard before). However, current linguistic theories typically prioritize explaining one type of knowledge over the other, and there is not yet a good understanding of how the two different types of knowledge co-exist and relate to one another. This conference brings together researchers with wide-ranging expertise and perspectives for a focused discussion to help advance a scientific understanding of how humans represent and use both types of knowledge.

This project aims to study how this is accomplished by measuring brain responses while bilinguals produce words in different languages with different grammatical rules. Through these results, the project aims to provide insights into the neurobiology of language more generally and answer questions about how people learn multiple languages. The project also creates a large, publicly available bilingual brain database, provides opportunities for the public to learn more about how the brain processes language, and provides training for students in advanced neuroscience techniques.<br/><br/>In detail, the project examines bilingual speech production through a series of experiments that measure brain responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while people say words that require them to produce a morphological change. By examining similarities in how morphological rules are used across multiple languages, the project aims to characterize when and where in the brain these processes take place. This approach can distinguish different theoretical models of bilingual language processing, specifically models that posit shared neural mechanisms across languages versus models that suggest distinct representations for each language.

Singlet fission is a unique process wherein an energetically excited molecule shares half its energy with a neighboring molecule. This energy redistribution can enable improved systems for energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and quantum sensing, but achieving this goal requires an improved understanding of how a material?s structure impacts its ability to both undergo singlet fission and transport energy. Professors Roberts, Aluru, and Cullinan will address this challenge by developing micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices that will be used mechanically strain molecular crystals to alter their internal structure. Computational modeling performed in concert with time-resolved microscopy measurements will identify how strain-induced changes in the structure of a crystal impacts its behavior to uncover structure-function relationships expected to guide the design of singlet fission materials for applications in energy harvesting and light detection. This project will support the training of three graduate students as well as two undergraduate student researchers from Austin Community College. <br/><br/>Singlet fission enables individual photons to be transduced into pairs of spin-triplet excitons. However, developing technologies that utilize singlet fission to boost their performance requires singlet fission materials that direct the spatial transport of the triplet excitons they generate. To address this, a research team led by Professor Roberts will map how the structure of molecular crystals dictates their ability to undergo singlet fission and transport triplet excitons by using mechanical strain to systematically alter their intermolecular structure. By mapping how singlet fission and exciton transfer depend on a material?s structure, the research team will establish benchmarks for refining theoretical models for singlet fission and exciton transfer while simultaneously guiding the design of new compounds that can meet current challenges in energy harvesting. To achieve its objectives, the research team will employ MEMS devices to strain molecular crystals and thin film heterojunctions in concert with transient absorption microscopy experiments that will track exciton diffusion with femtosecond time resolution and tens of nanometers spatial resolution. These measurements will be modeled using electronic structure calculations that will both predict how materials deform under applied strain and how these structural changes impact a material?s ability to generate and transport triplet excitons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their structural homology, subtle differences in the active sites of each tyrosine kinase engender them with the ability to phosphorylate different substrates, in part by recognizing specific linear patterns of amino acid sequences. There now exists a reasonable description of sequence preferences for nearly every human tyrosine kinase. However, a complete picture of the biophysical basis for substrate selection and knowledge of how tyrosine kinases select substrates in different signaling contexts are still lacking. In this work, researchers within the Shah laboratory will first use protein chemistry and high-throughput peptide phosphorylation screens to examine how post-translational modifications to tyrosine kinases alter their substrate specificities. Next, using biochemical measurements coupled with structural analysis, researchers will assess whether the first-order approximations of sequence specificity that currently dominate the field can be improved by taking into account the energetic coupling between individual amino acids within a linear recognition motif. Finally, using the biochemical and biophysical insights into substrate recognition gained, a unique strategy for the design and synthesis of selective kinase inhibitors will be explored. This effort will produce new chemical tools to dissect kinase signaling and provide a template for the development of a new modality of kinase-targeted inhibitors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology could also be applied to the manufacture of viral vaccines. This technology seeks to accelerate the manufacturing rate and reduce the costs associated with gene therapies for the treatment of life-threatening diseases, like melanoma, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophy. More specifically, this continuous purification technology could reduce capital manufacturing costs by 90% and operating costs by 50%, improving the competitiveness of the U.S. biotherapeutic market. By bringing this solution to market, this technological advancement could increase the accessibility and affordability of gene therapies for patients with both common and rare diseases, reducing overall healthcare costs in the U.S. while improving patient quality of life and life expectancy. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a continuous manufacturing process for viral gene therapy. The technology may reduce the costs of these biotherapeutics. Viral vector processing still uses batch processes, which are time consuming and expensive. This new solution is a continuous manufacturing process based on liquid-liquid extraction, which offers robust recovery (between 47-86%) for a diverse set of viral products, including adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 2 and 9, herpesvirus, and lentivirus. This technology includes a large range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses that can be purified with the same system. The continuous manufacturing approach has the potential to become a platform process for all viral particles, meaning that very little change in conditions is needed to purify a new viral particle.

The magnetosphere, created by Earth?s magnetic field, acts as an obstacle to the solar wind, the stream of charged particles from the Sun. This project seeks to understand the processes heating electrons at polar latitudes using a combination of theory, numerical modeling, and analysis of radar and satellite observations. The processes coupling energy from the solar wind and magnetosphere into the ionosphere are highly complex.  Accurately describing electron energetics in ionospheric models remains challenging due to the complex kinetic electron physics involved.  A key parameter for understanding the ionosphere and ion escape from the ionosphere is the temperature of electrons.  This research program will be combined with educational and public outreach efforts related to teaching about the physics of high-energy electrons in space, including those electrons that create the colors of the northern lights.  The energetic electron transport phenomena studied in this project are very closely related to auroral electron transport phenomena.  The project will create a ?Make Your Own Aurora? website where users can learn about heliophysics by digitally simulating auroral emissions.  Students of graduate and undergraduate levels will be involved in this project.   <br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the physical mechanisms controlling electron energetics in the polar cap ionosphere. The ability to predict ionospheric electron temperatures is of fundamental importance to aeronomy since they affect chemical reaction rates, ambipolar electric fields, plasma scale heights, and ion upflows.  Science questions to be addressed are 1) Which physical processes explain the electron temperatures observed in the polar cap ionosphere? 2) How do polar cap electron temperatures vary with solar, geomagnetic, and background plasma conditions? And 3) How do electron temperature variations relate to ion upflow variations?  They will perform statistical studies of temperature measurements from the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR), measurements from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, and energetic electron distributions from the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) spacecraft.

As a result, the ocean iron cycle is closely tied to the ocean carbon cycle. Progress in understanding the ocean iron cycle has been slower than for some other elements because it is present at very low concentrations and care must be taken to avoid contaminating samples. The international GEOTRACES program has, over the last twenty years, greatly accelerated progress in marine iron geochemistry. Capabilities have also been developed for measuring the stable isotopic composition of iron in seawater. In this project, a team of researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Hawaii will measure iron isotopes in samples from three GEOTRACES expeditions in the Pacific Ocean. This will produce an unprecedented data set for iron isotopes. Combining these data with ocean biogeochemical modeling, the team will address important questions about the sources of iron to the ocean and about biological cycling of iron. The project will support several early-career scientists, including postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students at each institution. Project data will be made publicly available through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office and in GEOTRACES data products.<br/><br/>Iron plays an essential role in driving oceanic biogeochemical cycles and is thought to limit phytoplankton growth over large regions of the surface oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, where primary productivity mediates deep ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange, and the eastern Equatorial Pacific, where iron feeds a highly productive ecosystem. Deep iron sources are key to the marine iron cycle, especially in the deep Pacific Ocean where hydrothermal venting from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has been suggested to supply dissolved iron to the Southern Ocean via upwelling. However, key questions remain about sources, longevity/speciation, and transport of this dissolved iron. Samples have been collected during two GEOTRACES zonal sections, from South America to Australia along 10S (GP21 in 2021) and Ecuador to Papua New Guinea along the Equator (GP11 in 2023). Samples are also available from one GEOTRACES-compliant cruise (GPc03) in the western subtropical Pacific. Using a combination of state-of-the-art iron isotope measurements and biogeochemical modelling, the team will address the following questions: 1) Using iron isotopes as a tracer, what is the relative supply of dust, sediment, and hydrothermal-derived iron to different regions of the shallow ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre and Equatorial upwelling zone, and how does iron supply vary in space and time? 2) How do microorganisms fractionate iron isotopes as they take up iron? How does the extent of this fractionation relate to the (temporally and spatially variable) nutrient limitation regimes and the degree of upper ocean iron recycling in the Equatorial-South Pacific? 3) What is the flux, isotope signature, and location of dissolved iron supplied to Pacific Deep Waters (PDW) by hydrothermal venting along the EPR and the Tonga/Kermadec arc? What are the stabilization mechanisms, isotopic changes, and longevity of this dissolved iron with transport? How do dissolved iron and iron isotopes evolve in PDW as it travels southward along the coast of South America and into the Southern Ocean? The results are expected to transform understanding of this essential micronutrient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how organisms make accurate, time-sensitive decisions with incomplete information is critical to determine how they process and respond to environmental signals. This project focuses on understanding how the bacterial pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium makes time-sensitive decisions when engulfed by immune cells. Using quantitative approaches to track decision-making in single bacteria in real-time, this research investigates how Salmonella balances speed and accuracy to survive the hostile environment of an immune cell. Understanding how bacteria make life-and-death decisions in this environment could lay the groundwork to disrupt bacterial decision-making as a means to treat disease. This project will generate fundamental new knowledge about cellular decision-making, with potential applications in synthetic biology, such as designing bacteria for sustainable agriculture, pollution cleanup, and disease diagnosis. The interdisciplinary educational component introduces high school students to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through a hands-on curriculum integrating biology, coding, and imaging. <br/><br/>When engulfed by a macrophage, Salmonella must rapidly adapt to the phagosome environment and activate virulence genes to survive. Activation of virulence genes is time-sensitive, as the host is actively attempting to neutralize the bacteria. However, phagosomal stimuli appear gradually and heterogeneously, making it challenging for the bacteria to rapidly classify this new environment. This project investigates how Salmonella use contextual cues for rapid and accurate decision-making in the intracellular environment. By combining microfluidics and live-cell imaging, this project tracks virulence responses at the single-cell level to determine how contextual cues impact the accuracy of the response. This research will position us to predict and perturb bacterial decision-making in the phagosome while also uncovering general principles about how cells balance the need for speed with accuracy when adapting to new environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such measurements are informing analyses related to fundamental biological questions, species conservation, ecosystem response to extreme events, and related topics. This trend towards sensor-based biology is exemplified by NSF?s National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which is collecting and making freely available massive quantities of biological data. Combined with satellite observations, biologists are presented with the unique challenge of synthesizing these data while advancing basic and applied research. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to greatly accelerate this work, but the community still faces pressing questions related to short- and long-term priorities and the most appropriate applications of cyberinfrastructure. This award will fund an interdisciplinary workshop, bringing together scientists to discuss priorities and chart a path forward. <br/><br/>This workshop will specifically foster new cross-disciplinary collaborations across ecological research, AI-enabled cyberinfrastructure, and physical infrastructure. By identifying short- and long-term research priorities with both ecologists and infrastructure developers, as well as related next steps, the workshop will lead to new knowledge, research roadmaps, interdisciplinary teams, pilot projects, and frontier ecological science research proposals. These will address critical knowledge gaps across the ecological and environmental sciences, as well as help to define community-wide needs for next-generation infrastructure to support transformative research breakthroughs. This workshop will help to accelerate innovation and translate discoveries into scalable, real-world applications to solve societal challenges such as ecological resilience, biodiversity loss, and sustainability. Cross-training researchers in AI and infrastructure will help to build a broad AI-capable national workforce across applied fields such as agriculture, forestry, land management, and environmental science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A precise understanding of the behavior of electrons in molecules and materials is needed to reliably predict their properties. Such understanding provides an enticing way to explore new compounds in lieu of performing many delicate and expensive experiments. Unfortunately, current theoretical approaches fail catastrophically when applied to systems with a particular kind of complicated electronic structure: strongly correlated electron systems. Examples of strong correlation can be found in compounds with several metallic centers with unpaired electrons, such as rare-earth metals, lanthanides, and actinides. In these situations, the trade-off between the reliability and tractability of traditional computational techniques is unacceptable, so they can only be used in the simplest cases. Solving this problem will facilitate the design of new organometallic catalysts, and more efficient energy-conversion and high-density data-storage devices. Dr. Miranda?s goal is to develop accurate, computationally efficient, and universal methods capable of treating strongly correlated systems. Dr. Miranda will use the software packages developed in his group to boost the undergraduate quantum chemistry curriculum at UF, allowing the students to tackle more realistic problems in their classes. Moreover, he will create videos and other types of online content to introduce topics in algebra, coding, and computational chemistry to a broader audience.<br/><br/>This project has three key aims: (1) design, implement, and test new wavefunction anstze capable of describing multi-reference problems; (2) develop a new perturbation theory framework as a robust way to optimize flexible wavefunctions and to help calculate various molecular properties; and (3) extend the domain of applicability of our methods using novel embedding techniques and apply them to realistic chemical compounds and processes. Dr. Miranda?s team will develop and exploit a framework (the Flexible Ansatz for N-body Configuration Interaction, FANCI) that greatly expedites the development and testing new wavefunction anstze. In particular, the focus will be on new families of wavefunction methods, combining traditional anstze (CI, CC) with novel ideas (quasi-particles, symmetry breaking, seniority) in non-traditional ways. The second goal will be centered on a flexible Perturbation Theory (PT) framework that could suit any possible multi-determinant wavefunction. This approach will be leveraged to facilitate calculation of Reduced Density Matrices and response functions. The final focus on general wavefunction-in-wavefunction embedding protocols will help to model changes in the spin state, redox behavior, etc. of strongly correlated systems. Dr. Miranda?s team will exploit the Fanpy/FANCI/FANPT framework as a way to enhance the preparation in computational chemistry at the undergraduate and high school level. With the help of UF?s Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET), they will interact with teachers to develop hands-on tools for their classrooms, while also hosting high school students. They will also work to engage the community through materials (mostly, videos/lectures) aimed to introduce coding, mathematic tools, and computational chemistry concepts and applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology uses tiniest controlled bursts of electricity to significantly enhance coating quality, eliminate processing steps, lowering costs, and reducing energy usage. The product will consist of a unique type of power generator, new to semiconductor processing, integrated to an applicator for energizing the gases used in the coating process. The product protected by strong patents and trade secrets will be sold to leading semiconductor process equipment companies for use on their existing systems, with company?s product market opportunity projected to be $200 million in year three of production. Beyond this first thin coating application, the technology can be extended to other advanced semiconductor applications, further growing company?s market opportunity to over $500M.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the limitations of current plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition to cost-effectively deposit hydrogen free, conformal oxide and nitride films. A new solution to semiconductor plasma processing is proposed using an array of micro-plasma dielectric barrier discharge applicators, powered by nanosecond scale high voltage pulses, capable of breaking down non-hydrogen containing reactants such as nitrogen thus avoiding hydrogen containing reactants such as ammonia, and achieve improved film conformality by eliminating ion bias induced anisotropic deposition.  Research objectives are, firstly, characterize set of 5 applicators over a range of physical electrode configurations, gas types, flow rates and pressure, and electrical pulse parameters, to determine optimum conditions for producing desired radicals and active species, whilst avoiding undesirable plasma breakdown regimes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and spectrometry will be used to measure gas breakdown effectiveness, with photoresist removal by oxygen used to determine surface reaction rates. Secondly, data gathered from an existing nanosecond high voltage pulsed generator will define Phase 2 generator specifications. Thirdly, 75 mm diameter ceramic-metal arrays containing multiple applicators, capable of scale up to 300 mm wafer processing size, will be tested.

Most of this is eaten by tiny organisms who rely on oxygen to consume the methane, a process called 'methane oxidation'. Oxygen levels vary naturally throughout the world?s oceans, so it is not known whether the ability of these organisms to consume methane is disrupted in some places. Custom one-of-a-kind instruments to measure methane consumption rates and monitor what organisms are present have been built by the investigators. The instruments will be sent to the bottom of the ocean for weeks and in different locations. The goal is to see how methane oxidation and the types of organisms present adjust to different oxygen concentrations and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>Natural gas seeps along the continental margins inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying waters. This methane is largely oxidized by microbes. Although microbial methanotrophs are largely microaerophilic, it is not known how differences in oxygen concentrations enhance or hinder their ability to respond nor whether methane consumption rates are controlled by deep-sea oxygen concentrations. Recent work has shown that microbial aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the deep sea occurs with widely varying rate constants. The project is to explore factors that drive this variation by making in situ measurements of MOx and microbial community dynamics at known seep sites offshore Louisiana, an area with frequent episodic methane releases, and on the Cascadia Margin offshore Oregon where highly variable bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) will provide vital evidence for how oxygen limitation affects MOx in situ. The in situ measurements are possible due to newly-developed benthic landers that can make MOx rate measurements on timescales of hours to weeks using advanced laser methane and optode DO sensors. An in situ collection and incubation scheme allows collection of microbial time-series, tracking the relative abundance of methanotrophs (through 16S rRNA surveys and metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) to study methanotrophic responses to varying ambient conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will create a hub for this type of analysis at NC State, strengthening scientific resources across the region. This position will also make the PIL?s resources more available for applied research projects from external users. Finally, this work will support public outreach on Earth history and connect local youth to STEM opportunities.<br/><br/>The new technician will contribute to directed research at the PIL, which focuses on resolving the conditions and drivers of changing climatic conditions and ecosystem impacts in the past. Specifically, this involves developing better analytical and interpretive approaches for terrestrial geochemistry proxies including carbonate clumped (?47) isotopes. Clumped isotope geochemistry is a rapidly growing area of paleoclimatology, because it offers a means to directly measure mineral temperatures and characterize changes in source fluids. This provides information to determine reconstructions of environmental temperatures, sediment burial and maturation histories, changes in water or hydrothermal fluid sources, feedback between tectonic uplift and climate, and even evaluating thermal strategies of organisms. The technician will assist with management and repair of specialized IRMS instrumentation, data collection and experimental design for carbonate standard and clumped isotope studies, training students and visiting researchers in isotope systematics and applications, and contributing to public outreach events, thereby contributing to these efforts for both ongoing and future NSF-funded projects.

The physics of curved quantum materials is a particularly interesting case. For instance, current flowing along a curved surface is theorized to generate a force whose nature can reveal information about the host material. In this project, the research team aims to develop a new method for detecting the role of curvature induced in two-dimensional materials by placing them on top of nanoscale resonators. The curvature alters the stiffness, which can be measured experimentally. The success of this project will be to provide a general approach to controlling properties of noel materials based on their curvature. This project features a strong, combined scientific and educational component. Educational activities include the development of new modules in the undergraduate curriculum, building laboratories demonstrations that make some our proposed concepts tangible ? for instance corrections to elasticity due to centrifugal forces. These demonstrations will be presented both at the undergraduate level within the University of Chicago and externally at popular science events.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: Rapid technological advancements in quantum science are quickly finding use in other fields. This project adapts high-quality ?trampoline? resonators pioneered for quantum experiments in optomechanics as a probe of forces in two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials by forming 2D-trampoline hybrid systems. In addition to being able to detect minute forces, 2D-trampoline hybrids promise access to previously invisible observables related to the interplay between in-plane electronic order and spatial curvature. Such exotic forces are not only interesting in their own right but perhaps provide a key general approach for identifying topological materials, which are important for metrology, classical electronics, and quantum computing. The technical approach is to place a target material on top of a trampoline resonator, and to precisely measure the mechanical motion. Curvature response of the target material will cause corrections to the mechanical eigenfrequencies. The project pursues a set of experimental goals with escalating technical demands and physical rewards. Initial experiments will measure the centrifugal force on supercurrent in a curved surface. These experiments naturally lead to exploration of the role of spatial curvature on superconducting vortices and will allow us to test predictions that vortices feel a repulsive force from regions of spatial curvature. Finally, we will integrate two-dimensional materials with our membranes to search for mechanical signatures of the Wen-Zee curvature coupling in quantum Hall systems. The end point is not only the demonstration of fascinating physical effects, but a new, general approach for exploring the interplay between geometry and topology in two-dimensional materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many biological molecules are chiral?like our left and right hands, they exist in two mirror-image forms that are chemically identical but structurally distinct.

In principle, objects with this kind of mirror asymmetry can produce a voltage when we twist them, or twist when we apply a voltage. The catch? It works best when the chiral objects are very small, on the scale of molecules. This project will exploit the electric potential of common biological molecules to create cheap, abundant power sources and microscopic motors.

The majority of biological molecules are chiral, allowing for a range of cheap, abundant materials to explore for power related applications . Because the symmetry breaking arises from the molecular chirality rather than crystallinity, even amorphous and polycrystalline solids made of chiral molecules can, in principle, exhibit torsional piezoelectricity.  Arguments based only on mirror symmetry indicate that non-zero components of the piezoelectric tensor exist  and must switch sign for chiral enantiomers This two-year project will study both left- and right-handed enantiomers of at least three different molecules to establish a general relationship between chirality and torsional piezo-electricity.  Amorphous and crystalline solids of chiral molecules will be fabricated via melting with fast and slow cooling, and sintering.  The direct piezoelectric effect will be measured  by subjecting the solids to torsional stresses  in a variety of geometries and measuring the resulting voltage.  The inverse effect will be obtained by subjecting the solid to different voltage configurations and measuring the motion using optical methods. The intellectual merits of this project include the elucidation of novel piezoelectric symmetry breaking mechanisms that may result in functional materials as well as torsional piezoelectric mechanisms for biological energy transfer/mechano-sensing.

For many applications, their electrical conductivity must be increased by adding positive (p-type) or negative (n-type) charges. This process is known as molecular doping. While there are many p-type organic semiconductors, n-type organic semiconductors are far rarer. Moreover, they are less stable in ambient conditions, and it can be difficult to control their electrical conductivity. Advancing the field of organic electronics will require development of new electronic materials and processes for n-type doping. The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of n-type doping using a catalyst, a compound that enhances the speed of a chemical reaction. The investigator will combine synthetic strategies for new organic semiconductors with selection of n-type dopant-catalyst pairs to optimize the doping process. This research will result in a new class of n-type organic semiconductors with high-performance and enhanced stability. This research will also promote understanding on how the new n-type materials affect device performance. The PI?s educational goal is to foster a positive perception of organic electronic materials and devices. This will be accomplished through outreach to middle and high school students, coupling course instruction to undergraduate and graduate research projects, and providing internship opportunities at a start-up company to foster entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/><br/>The doping of inorganic materials has been instrumental in the progress of the semiconductor industry and advances in numerous fields including medical diagnostics, environmental science, and homeland security. For organic semiconductors, several strategies have yielded doped ?-electron solids with greatly enhanced optical and electronic properties as well as novel materials, physical phenomena, and device concepts. However, these advances were largely enabled by p-doped (hole transporting) materials, while useful n-doped (electron-transporting) materials have been limited in chemical accessibility, doping efficiency, and environmental stability. This limits their use in devices where both p-type and n-type semiconductors are required. Recently, the PI and coworkers discovered that metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au) can catalytically assist/accelerate the doping of representative organic semiconductors by molecular dopants. This research project will: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of the catalytic n-doping process and expand the scope to other type of catalysts. 2) Explore other dopants and semiconductors, implementing to date unexplored structural design and synthetic strategies. 3) Characterize catalyzed vs uncatalyzed doped film properties in terms of composition, electronic structure, morphology, microstructure, and opto-electronic response. Thus, this study plans to bring n-doped organics to unprecedented levels in terms of molecular/macromolecular materials designs, their accessibility in scale, and their useful opto-electronic properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The remarkable property of the zero resistance has enabled many important applications, such as generating powerful magnetic fields for maglev trains and MRI machines.

As such, advancing our understanding and control of superconductivity remains a cornerstone of condensed matter physics. Recent advances in laser technology have opened exciting possibilities for manipulating superconductivity on ultrafast timescales using light. However, many fundamental questions about superconductivity remain unanswered due to a lack of necessary tools capable of probing the underlying properties directly. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing and applying innovative ultrafast spectroscopic techniques to explore non-equilibrium superconductivity. In addition to its scientific goals, the project includes a robust educational component. It aims to enhance the curriculum in ultrafast and nonlinear optics, provide mentorship opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and conduct outreach activities with local schools in the New York area to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>This project investigates light-driven non-equilibrium dynamics in various superconductors by focusing on the terahertz (THz) frequency range, a natural energy scale of superconducting gap energy. Thus, THz driving can avoid injecting excess heat and lead to unprecedented phenomena, which provide unique properties of superconductivity that are unreachable by frequently used near-infrared excitation. Nevertheless, the study of non-equilibrium superconductivity remains in its infancy due to the lack of appropriate probes of superconductivity on the ultrafast time scale of a few picoseconds. The project will investigate THz-driven collective excitations of superconducting order parameters that can provide unique information, including couplings between two superconducting order parameters and pairing symmetry. This project employs newly developed THz multidimensional coherent spectroscopy for this goal. The project also aims to manipulate superconductivity optically, including its phase coherence and topology, using the recently proposed Floquet engineering. Raman spectroscopy is combined with THz driving to investigate the superconducting order parameter. The innovative spectroscopic techniques developed here are broadly applicable to diverse quantum materials, including frustrated magnets, topological insulators, and Moir materials.

Materials synthesis remains a crucial bottleneck to the materials discovery process. This project directly addresses this synthesis bottleneck in an emerging class of ternary chalcogenide-based semiconductors. Many materials in this family have been computationally predicted to have excellent properties for solar cells, energy-efficient electronics, and batteries ? materials needed to directly and indirectly advance national health and security. However, experimental synthesis of these predicted materials has proven challenging, as only a handful of these materials have been made. This project involves computationally-led experiments and experimentally-informed computational work to understand and design new synthetic approaches to access these materials. The collaborative nature of this project provides a unique training experience for graduate students through their engagement in advanced computational and experimental research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>This project aims to discover new ternary chalcogenides for optoelectronic applications by leveraging alternative entropy sources that can enable materials synthesis. Many ternary chalcogenides have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable and exhibit compelling optical or electronic properties. Yet, only a small fraction of these predicted compounds have been experimentally synthesized. This project operates under the hypothesis that synthesis of these materials requires careful control of thermodynamic driving forces through entropic factors to prevent competitive compositional decomposition reactions or polymorphic transitions. Specifically, this project employs control over entropy associated with point defect formation, crystal vibrations, and gas evolution to stabilize and synthesize targeted chalcogenide materials relative to competing binary reaction products or polymorphs. The synthesis science discoveries have potential to apply broadly to other classes of materials. This collaborative project leverages first-principles thermodynamic calculations to lead experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as experimental work to inform computational efforts.  Together, this project provides comprehensive training to student researchers in solid-state materials chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will use a combination of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study electrolytes of varying salt concentrations, cations and anions, and pH values to support their hypothesis that the electrochemical window of aqueous solutions can be expanded by discouraging their solvation of hydroxides and protons, the byproducts of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively.

The construction of complex organic molecules is an important target in the development of novel pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and consumer products. The elaboration of building blocks such as olefins, aromatics, and saturated hydrocarbons into more complex structures can be achieved by chemical reactions involving carbene fragments, which typically require metal catalysts to proceed efficiently. The best catalyst systems available currently rely heavily on rare and precious metals, which increases the cost of the resulting products and presents sustainability challenges due to limited resource availability. This research aims to develop design principles for earth-abundant metal complexes that can replace precious metals in carbene transfer catalysis. The development of iron- and cobalt-catalyzed processes in particular has the potential to improve fine chemical production in the United States. Dr. Milsmann and his students will actively participate in community outreach involving the development and presentation of chemistry demonstrations at the K-12 level, and will develop new hands-on experiments for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry,Carsten Milsmann of West Virginia University will study the electronic structures of four-coordinate iron- and cobalt-carbene complexes and their resulting reactivities as competent intermediates in carbene transfer catalysis. Of particular interest are complexes with square-planar or cis-divacant octahedral geometries that possess open coordination sites adjacent to the carbenoid ligand. The first aim of these studies is to establish how changes in the molecular structure and coordination geometry influence the electronic structures of the resulting complexes and their reactive metal carbenoid fragments. The second aim seeks to connect differences in electronic structure to changes in reactivity by studying  catalytically competent, isolable iron- and cobalt-carbene complexes. A key hypothesis of the proposed research is that open coordination sites in square-planar carbene complexes will allow unprecedented control over the regioselectivity of carbene transfer using directing groups on the substrates. Finally, the third aim is to investigate the potential of four-coordinate iron carbenes to engage in [2+2] cycloaddition chemistry, which is a key step toward iron catalyst-mediated olefin metathesis. The proposed complexes possess coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, potentially opening up new opportunities for the control of reactivity compared to previously reported iron-carbene complexes.

How does the brain allow individuals to actively control signaling behaviors appropriate to different social contexts? Danionella fishes are among the smallest adult vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and are transparent throughout their lifetime. These qualities give unprecedented access to the entire brain, not yet possible in any other vertebrate. Leveraging Danionella?s relatively simple, highly stereotyped and readily measurable acoustic and postural displays produced only during aggression, the investigators of this project investigate how the adult vertebrate brain regulates communication during aggression. Cellular and molecular methods are used to identify neurons activated during aggressive interactions in brain regions (cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus) that together are proposed to be comparable to a core aggression system in mammals. Artificial intelligence-based methods are used to quantify adult posture and movements during aggression. This approach provides a rigorous analytical framework with which to evaluate the behavioral effects of neuroimaging-guided, laser-induced disruptions to individual brain regions comprising the proposed core aggression circuit. The new model for behavioral neuroscience used in this project thus presents a unique opportunity for identifying and understanding brain networks activated in adults during social interactions and, more specifically, during aggression. The project also includes activities aimed at transferring knowledge via interactive public events, and to provide interdisciplinary training and education to individuals at different career stages. <br/> <br/>Understanding how forebrain neuronal networks (e.g., preoptic area, hypothalamus) control the output of downstream motor-patterning circuitry in the midbrain remains central to understanding how the brain enables individuals to select and sequence different patterns of behavior. Social communication behaviors in fishes are particularly tractable models for addressing this challenge. Their behaviors are often highly stereotyped, differ in a finite set of easily quantified features, and depend on precise patterns of neural activation. Recent studies effectively demonstrate that miniature, transparent species of Danionella fishes, which are among the smallest living adult vertebrates, provide particularly tractable models for uncovering principles of neuro-behavioral mechanisms applicable to all vertebrates. Unlike the closely-related zebrafish, which are neither naturally transparent nor miniature as adults, Danionella adults make robust acoustic and postural displays that are often closely linked in timing during aggressive interactions. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to map a forebrain aggression network that is activated in Danionella during multimodal displays and identify its neurochemical phenotypes. Aim 2 involves use of laser ablations of select forebrain sites identified in Aim 1 to test the predictions of a model, informed by artificial intelligence-based quantitative analysis of acoustic, postural, and jaw extension displays, about the forebrain?s role in driving acoustic and postural behaviors. These aims offer unprecedented opportunities to establish Danionella as a model to guide brain-wide optical and genetic studies of neural circuits underlying adult vertebrate aggression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the greatest threats facing human society in the coming decades is an increase in antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The widespread use of antibiotics starting in the mid-20th century led to plummeting rates of mortality from infections and contributed to one of the greatest increases in life expectancy of any technological innovation. Unfortunately more and more infections that resist antibiotic treatment are occurring, threatening to undo those advances and usher in a much more dangerous post-antibiotic era. The overuse of antibiotics by doctors and hospitals is often cited as the cause of this change, but research suggests that environmental pollution might also play a role. In a historically contaminated part of Birmingham, Alabama, that has housed coal-burning facilities for over a century, elevated levels of heavy metals like lead and manganese appear to favor the evolution of bacteria that are resistant not only to these toxic substance but also to antibiotics. The predominantly African American residents of the affected neighborhoods already face elevated levels of respiratory and other chronic diseases, and they may also face elevated risk of dangerous antibiotic resistant infection due to the heavy metals in their environment. This research will put a scientific lens on the question of where antibiotic resistance comes from and how it spreads from point sources into the environment, but it will also confront the environmental injustice experienced by the human beings who are bearing the costs of decades of industrial pollution. The project will involve the people who live in the affected neighborhoods, where the researchers will attempt to win back some of the trust in science that has been lost due to a history of neglect and corruption surrounding this neighborhood and its ongoing struggle with the residue of its industrial past.<br/><br/>It is generally accepted that antibiotic resistance spreads fastest in bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. This research will attempt to observe these exchanges taking place using a unique laboratory method, where an environmental sample is separated from laboratory bacteria by a membrane that has pores big enough to allow DNA, but not cells, to pass, and then to see what kinds of antibiotic resistance genes from the environment are able to be transferred into the lab strains. Researchers will also collect soil and wastewater from around the Birmingham area to see how much antibiotic resistance exists in the environment, and mathematicians will use computer models to understand whether the resistance genes are coming from humans using antibiotics as medicine, from agricultural sources, from pollution in the soil, or from a combination of these factors. Despite the critical importance of horizontal gene transfer in this and other bacterial activities, very little is known about how it actually takes place in nature, how fast it can move genes around, or how far from a point source it can move resistance genes; this research will address all of these topics using cutting-edge laboratory and computational tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Arithmetic Geometry is the study of spaces from the point of view of number theory and is largely concerned with the solutions of polynomial equations, especially over the integers. Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations. In recent years there have been a number of important developments in this area and the purpose of the week-long workshop and conference is to bring together established experts in these areas along with early-career researchers with the goal of stimulating further progress.<br/><br/>In more detail, in recent years there have been major developments in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, as well as the conjectures of Thomason and Morel concerned with equivariant phenomena for actions of linear algebraic groups. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles.

Examples include searching for the perfect snack in a supermarket, looking for a misplaced phone in a cluttered room, or finding a friend in a busy restaurant. The efficiency with which humans perform these tasks has a significant impact on the quality of daily life. The current project uses behavior, eye-tracking, virtual reality, brain activity, and computational modeling to test the idea that the efficiency of visual search depends on two stages of processing with two different computational goals: 1) a first stage with ?good enough? attentional guidance to select potential targets for closer inspection, and 2) a second stage involving a decision that emphasizes accuracy over speed. The overall goal is to understand organizing principles that make visual search efficient. In addition to the scientific work, this project supports the training and professional development of undergraduate students with activities that build scientific literacy, analytical skills, and emphasize links between classroom learning and the workforce.<br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that guidance and decisions in visual search rely on different types of information because they have different computational goals, not because they work on different feature types. One set of experiments tests the prediction that during visual search, attentional guidance prioritizes speed over accuracy, but that decisions prioritize accuracy over speed. To do this, simple stimulus arrays in which the precision and feature-dimension used for guidance and decisions are separately measured using eye-tracking data, electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERPs), and drift-diffusion modeling (DDM). Another set of experiments, also using behavior, EEG, and DDMs, test the prediction that attentional guidance relies on non-target information such as prior knowledge about typical scenes because they act as rapidly detectable spatial cues for the target.

Martin Edwards of the University of Arkansas will develop the next generation of tools for nanoscale analysis of electrochemical interfaces. Interfacial electrochemical processes are important in a broad range of scientifically and industrially important fields, such as energy storage and conversion, biosensing, and corrosion. Spatial variation in interfacial structure and behavior occurs at the nanoscale. Thus, mapping electrochemical processes on a comparable scale is essential to furthering their understanding and optimization. This project will produce tools that miniaturize and localize measurements that are hitherto possible only on whole electrodes. An annual summer workshop will help develop in-demand skills in multiphysics modelling. Multiphysics modelling creates a computer description of a real-world system incorporating physical and chemical processes. This model allows rapid prototyping, optimization, quantitative interpretation of measurements, hypothesis testing, and more. Workshop participants, ranging from upper-level undergraduate students through faculty, will gain skills that are sought after in both academia and industry. The resources developed for the workshop (step-by-step guides with pedagogical content, recorded lectures, example models) will be publicly available through a web portal.<br/><br/>The Edwards lab will develop enhanced electroanalytical tools based upon an electrochemical scanned-probe microscopy platform. The tools will allow control and manipulation of the electrical and chemical environment during measurements. These tools will allow mapping of the current-voltage response of electrochemically active interfaces under a broad range of solution conditions and with ~10-1000 nm spatial resolution. Mapping the heterogeneity of electrochemical interfaces with nanoscale resolution is necessary to understand structure-activity relationships. Varying the chemical environment will assist mechanistic understanding and facilitate new experimental paradigms, with applications in electrocatalyst screening and mechanistic understanding of electrochemical reactions. This project will influence fields including electrocatalysis, energy storage and conversion, sensing, electrosynthesis, corrosion, and electrodeposition. Multiphysics finite element modelling, including the coupled Nerst-Planck, Poisson, and Navier-Stokes equations, will aid experimental design and interpretation of measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. Enzymes may be used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications including food and beverage processing, pharmaceutical and cosmetic production, animal feeds, textiles, paper production, and household cleaning products.  Currently, enzymes are limited by the number of reactions they can catalyze and also by their lack of stability in organic solvents and at high temperatures. To address these challenges, protein engineering has been developed to create new enzymes with novel properties. However, this technology is often hampered by the inability to specifically identify or design enzymes with the combination of properties needed to make the process both technically feasible and economically viable. The aim of this discovery platform is to identify enzyme variants that have the required combination of properties to create new industrial enzymes with superior properties that will improve industrial processes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a platform to identify regions of the amino acid sequence space that encode proteins for enzyme-based industrial processes. Proteins in nature occur as protein families that share similar amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures but often have considerable functional diversity. Biotech companies developing, producing, or using enzymes may encounter a protein from a protein family of interest exhibiting excellent stability but slow catalytic activity while another protein from this protein family has the opposite pair of functional characteristics (excellent catalytic rate but poor stability). Currently, it is challenging to obtain an enzyme that combines both desirable properties. A process has been developed that may yield dually optimized enzymes. This approach provides an enhanced sampling approach to identify previously undiscoverable functional proteins in sequence space. The solution is applicable to any enzyme or protein activity for which an optical readout is available either for the purified protein or in cell-based assays and it may be used to achieve optimal combinations of a wide range of protein properties. The goal of the technology is to identify variants of proteins and enzymes that exhibit a combination of enhanced properties. This enhanced sampling technology is based on the design and experimental study of a series of computationally derived proteins.  The technology combines gene synthesis, high-throughput measurements of the properties of enzyme variants, and strategies to select the most informative sequences. Such proteins may make enzyme-based industrial processes economically viable and yield proteins with superior properties for a range of biotechnology applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, access to quality STEM education experiences can be limited among historically underserved youth. Furthermore, women and individuals identifying as Latinx or Black remain underrepresented in STEM fields. Responding to community needs, this project will develop and study a curriculum that leverages sports to teach STEM content and practices to youth in informal learning settings. While the idea of contextualizing STEM learning through sports is not new, the proposed work is particularly important in that it focuses on youth aged 8 through 11, while most of the existing research on STEM and sports centers on students in middle school and beyond. In close partnership with a historically underserved community, the project team will advance youths? STEM content knowledge, practices, and identity based on community goals, values, and assets. <br/><br/>Guided by sociocultural learning theories, the positive youth development model, and theories of STEM identity development, the project team and participating community members will co-develop a STEM and sports program that is rooted in the local context, community-identified goals, and youths? own interests. Using participatory design research techniques and building on a pilot program, the project will develop a six-week STEM program, Teaming STEM + Sports, that is aligned with national STEM and physical education standards for youth aged 8 through 11 years. The project team will collaborate closely with youth, parents, community members, educators, and nonprofit organizations throughout the project. Community and nonprofit partners will implement the curriculum each summer in community settings over four years, reaching over 250 youth participants. Using iterative descriptive studies as part of the development process and a quasi-experiment to test the program?s impact, the project will address the following research questions: (1) To what extent do youth perceive the program as culturally relevant, connected with their lived experiences, and engaging? (2) How does participation in Teaming STEM +Sports associate with youths? STEM content knowledge and STEM identity? (3) What is the effect of the program on youths? mathematics and science content knowledge? (4) To what extent are youth provided with opportunities to use STEM practices? (5) To what extent do facilitators perceive the program as feasible to implement? Insights related to collaboration and codesign will be transferable to other contexts, and digital versions of the curriculum will be available on a project website, enabling others to adopt the Teaming STEM + Sports program and adapt it to their local contexts.<br/><br/>This Integrating Research and Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

This project seeks to co-develop and implement a locally relevant and integrated computer science curriculum that centers the lived experiences of rural Hawaiian students and communities. It is hypothesized that understanding and engaging local educational needs creates opportunities for students to learn in ways that make schooling meaningful and relevant to their experiences, culture, community, identity. These impacts will increase interest, belonging and pursuit of STEM coursework and careers.<br/><br/>Using a mixed methods approach, researchers and educators will work together to iteratively co-design and evaluate curricular materials that center Hawaiian students? experiences and sense of community to support youth in developing strong connections to STEM learning that foster their future engagement and interest in STEM. Before, during, and after co-design activities, the research team will directly observe interactions amongst teachers and students during instructional time.  As implementation, design, and refinement of the curriculum proceeds, the research team will leverage interview, focus group, and observational data collection from multiple stakeholders (i.e., school administrators, staff, teachers, students, and parents of students), to develop survey items. These items reflect distinct perspectives on what schooling and school success are and should be, the perceived value of and interest in future opportunities associated with Computer Science, s well as the level of empowerment and inclusion experienced. The surveys will be administered 3 times per year. The team will initially conduct exploratory factor analyses on the responses to establish a tentative factor structure that links the meanings for items held by stakeholders within the community to broader concepts. As those components stabilize within groups across the three deployments of the first full academic year (Fall, Y1-Spring Y2), analyses will move to a confirmatory factor analytic framework to validate the within-group measurement structure, moving next to assessing measurement invariance between groups and across time. The results of this study will allow the team to develop an evidence-based, transferable model of curriculum development that centers the experiences of local students to meet the educational needs of rural communities. Further, the team will develop locally responsive measures of educational success, student sense of belonging, and agency in schooling to gauge its development in context over three years of middle school and to ascertain impacts of materials developed using this model for rural curricular development. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

The ionosphere significantly alters the propagation of radio waves passing through it, including communication and navigation signals transmitted from satellites. Because of their impacts on radio propagation, understanding the processes creating structures in the ionosphere is a critical part of space weather research.  This research will be conducted with numerical models of the coupled thermosphere and ionosphere as well as analysis of ionospheric data from radars and the global positioning system.

Magnetospheric energy inputs drive significant variations in the high-latitude neutral thermosphere. This project will examine ion-neutral coupling processes at high latitudes to understand how the thermospheric dynamics affect the electron density structures and associated ion outflow. The specific science questions to be addressed are (1) How do thermospheric density and composition changes during geomagnetic storms affect the formation and evolution of high-latitude electron density structures? and (2) How do thermospheric variations modulate the supply of ion upflow and outflow?  These questions will be addressed with controlled numerical experiments coupling the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model 3.0 (TIEGCM 3.0) model of the neutral thermosphere to the High-latitude Ionospheric Dynamics for Research Applications (HIDRA) model of the high-latitude ionosphere and polar wind. The team will contrast simulations using the coupled model to simulations using a static thermosphere to isolate ion neutral coupling effects. They will compare the simulation results to observations of high-latitude density structures from incoherent scatter radars (e.g. RISR) and GPS total electron content observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, one person?s ""pole"" might sound like another person?s ""bowl."" The difference between such minimally different words comes down to small details in how they are pronounced. Some of these details vary across accents. However, no matter who the speaker is, listeners can quickly adjust to novel accents. This project examines how people adapt to talker differences in speech production and tests the hypothesis that people adapt by shifting their attention to different acoustic cues when it improves accuracy. The research is guided by a computer model that predicts how this process works. Societal benefits include a training app, training for graduate and undergraduate students, and publicly sharing available materials. <br/><br/>This project combines computational modeling and behavioral experimentation to test key predictions of a computational model of accent adaptation. The model is built on the ideas of learned selective attention theory and reinforcement learning, representing a novel application of these theories to speech perception. The central hypothesis of the model is that listeners use reinforcement learning from prediction error to rapidly reallocate attention across perceptual dimensions. This project tests (1) whether focusing attention on a perceptual dimension makes it easier to learn about that dimension?s relationship to speech categories, (2) whether individuals who weight a dimension highly are the individuals who find it easiest to change the weight of that dimension, and (3) whether variability along a dimension has a different effect on learning rate depending on whether the dimension is to be up-weighted or down-weighted.

It looks at the impact of the specific language that an individual encounters in day-to-day life (i.e., specific websites, videos, books, magazines, and social media), as well as factors like memory, the speed with which information is processed, and the ability to mentally track ideas. Understanding how each of these factors influence language processing and language learning informs an understanding of how humans learn language, with the translational potential of developing more effective methods of language acquisition. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how an individual's experience with language affects language processing abilities. Factors like reading habits, exposure to different types of text, and cognitive abilities (such as working memory, attention, and processing speed) are measured to determine how each factor influences an individual's preferences and performance when processing complex English sentence structures. Although the scientific literature suggests that speakers are extremely sensitive to the linguistic frequency of grammatical structures and words in a language, how exactly frequency is used is unclear. Some work proposes that speakers' linguistic preferences match the frequency with which they encounter these structures in day-to-day life, but more recent findings suggest that people with more experience with language are more flexible in their language preferences. The project will involve two main experiments. The first experiment assesses how much experience with language, as measured by self-reported reading habits and the characteristics of the texts that participants read online, impacts preferences for dative sentences and phrasal verbs. The second experiment examines how reading experience and cognitive abilities interact to influence how quickly and accurately participants process sentences with complex syntactic structures. The findings help inform language teaching practices and help to develop interventions that better support learners based on their unique experiences and cognitive profiles.

Geoeconomics, a largely unexplored area, studies the economies of countries and the relationship among countries on a global scale. Great powers use geoeconomic strengths and related policies to achieve their geopolitical and economic objectives. This research consists of five projects. It studies the consequences of a great power that can project economic influence, provides empirical measurement of geoeconomic powers, and examines how countries can shield themselves from unwanted influence. It also analyzes competition between great powers of the world and the role of a country?s currency in power projection. Finally, it investigates competition and cooperation in corporate tax regimes. The results are globally relevant given the focus on strategic sectors, trade policy, and national security concerns over ownership of strategic assets. The research findings could help develop optimal geoeconomic strategies, enhance the wellbeing of citizens, and structure international interactions among countries. The research also produces teaching materials designed to equip future students and researchers with the tools they need to further advance the field.<br/><br/>This award funds research projects that study how countries leverage their international economic relationships to pursue geopolitical and economic objectives. This theoretical and empirical research consists of five parts. This research first provides a theoretical framework, a basic model of geoeconomics, to understand how countries can leverage their international economic relationships to influence the policies and economic activities in foreign countries. Second, it focuses on the trade-off between economic security and integration and studies how countries can most effectively safeguard themselves against unwanted foreign influence, balancing the need to safeguard economic security against the benefits of international economic integration. This project provides a model-based measure of power and, drawing on public data on trade and financial service flows, estimates the sources of power for Great Powers. Third, in an increasingly multipolar world with geopolitical rivals, it examines great power competition and assesses how international economic activities and political relationships are shaped by great power competition. It develops a theoretical model of competing influence by multiple hegemons within a global production network and constructs a new dataset of government ownership to trace how governments are expanding strategic investments. Fourth, it investigates geopolitics of currency competition and studies how a country having a dominant currency shapes a geoeconomic strategy, with particular emphasis on the effect of the rise of alternative currencies. This research employs a dynamic model of reputation building in which countries compete to supply safe assets, and in which there are economic and geopolitical benefits to becoming a reserve currency. Fifth, it focuses on international national tax competition, cooperation, and geopolitics and evaluates how countries compete and cooperate over corporate tax regimes, with an emphasis on the potential for international cooperation as well as for hegemonic countries to use coercion to enforce their preferred tax regime. This study uses micro-data on activities of U.S. multinationals to estimate elasticities of firm activities to changes in corporate tax regimes. These statistics are used to inform a quantitative model of tax competition across countries that is used to evaluate the welfare and distributional consequences of corporate tax reform. These projects could enable researchers and decision-makers to gain deeper insights into the underlying drivers of international relations and the influence of geoeconomic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study focuses on the molecular mechanisms placing 6mA in the appropriate genomic context. Understanding 6mA could reveal new aspects of how genes are turned on and off, shedding light on fundamental processes of life. This research not only advances basic science but also has potential implications for understanding epigenetic changes in health and disease. The project also has strong educational and community outreach components.

This ensures the next generation of scientists is equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to continue advancing this important field. <br/><br/>This project will study DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA) using the unicellular eukaryote Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system.  6mA?s potential as a eukaryotic epigenetic mark has attracted great interest, but its biogenesis and functional implications remain elusive.  Tetrahymena is the first eukaryote with 6mA found in its nuclear DNA 50 years ago, and more recently, with a 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) identified and characterized.  Using Single Molecule Real-Time, Circular Consensus Sequencing, 6mA on individual Tetrahymena genomic DNA molecules are mapped with high sensitivity and accuracy, and at single-nucleotide resolution.  AMT1, a member of the MT-A70 family of MTases, is shown to be crucial for establishing the transcription-associated 6mA distribution pattern in Tetrahymena.  Nonetheless, how 6mA is specifically deposited?in the context of transcription, replication, and chromatin?still needs to be elucidated.  The PIs will dissect transcription-associated and replication-coupled targeting mechanisms for 6mA deposition.  The PIs will also elucidate the biochemical and structural basis for AMT1-dependent, semiconservative, and chromatin-guided transmission of 6mA.

While existing scholarship emphasizes the role of trust in shaping civic attitudes and behavior, research often overlooks how one?s willingness to take risks can vary across different aspects of life, and neglects how risk taking might affect the extent to which trust affects civic participation. By systematically investigating how trust and risk interact to shape civic attitudes and behavior, this project aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of civic engagement, for example, why individuals might trust the government but remain skeptical of the electoral process, or why people continue to participate in civic activities despite increasing distrust in civic elites and institutions over time. <br/><br/>Leveraging original data collected during the November 2024 presidential election, this project examines the relationship between different types of trust and risk taking, hypothesizing that the extent to which people rely on trust may depend on how willing they are to take certain risks. Whereas individuals who are less willing to take certain risks may rely more on trust when deciding whether to vote or engage in other civic activities, those who are more willing to take certain risks may rely less on trust when deciding whether to participate. Combined with complementary experimental data, this project provides robust evidence on the roles of trust and risk taking in shaping civic attitudes and behavior. These data will also be used to develop a novel and validated measure of civic risk taking. Findings from this research help advance interdisciplinary scholarship while offering policymakers, scholars, and society guidance for mitigating deficits in trust, enhancing civic participation, and improving democratic health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Materials synthesis remains a crucial bottleneck to the materials discovery process. This project directly addresses this synthesis bottleneck in an emerging class of ternary chalcogenide-based semiconductors. Many materials in this family have been computationally predicted to have excellent properties for solar cells, energy-efficient electronics, and batteries ? materials needed to directly and indirectly advance national health and security. However, experimental synthesis of these predicted materials has proven challenging, as only a handful of these materials have been made. This project involves computationally-led experiments and experimentally-informed computational work to understand and design new synthetic approaches to access these materials. The collaborative nature of this project provides a unique training experience for graduate students through their engagement in advanced computational and experimental research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>This project aims to discover new ternary chalcogenides for optoelectronic applications by leveraging alternative entropy sources that can enable materials synthesis. Many ternary chalcogenides have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable and exhibit compelling optical or electronic properties. Yet, only a small fraction of these predicted compounds have been experimentally synthesized. This project operates under the hypothesis that synthesis of these materials requires careful control of thermodynamic driving forces through entropic factors to prevent competitive compositional decomposition reactions or polymorphic transitions. Specifically, this project employs control over entropy associated with point defect formation, crystal vibrations, and gas evolution to stabilize and synthesize targeted chalcogenide materials relative to competing binary reaction products or polymorphs. The synthesis science discoveries have potential to apply broadly to other classes of materials. This collaborative project leverages first-principles thermodynamic calculations to lead experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as experimental work to inform computational efforts.  Together, this project provides comprehensive training to student researchers in solid-state materials chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of quantum physics  in technology is rapidly growing. Quantum mechanics combines both particle and wave concepts leading to unintuitive but very robust effects used in modern technology. In recent years, the focus of quantum research has shifted to non-equilibrium phenomena including but not limited to quantum computation and simulation in complex circuits, various high-precision metrological applications, and designing quantum materials with desired properties by driving them away from thermal equilibrium.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two major themes: i) understanding, characterizing and controlling chaos in interacting many-particle systems and ii) developing formalism for describing systems which have both quantum and classical degrees of freedom interacting with each other. <br/>Most systems around us are chaotic. On the one hand chaos reduces our ability to predict and control the behavior of various systems. On the other, it leads to long time stability of matter. Colloquially, the situation is like with tornadoes: they appear because of chaos leading to instabilities in the atmosphere and they disappear also because of chaos eventually relaxing to a homogeneous state dictated by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics, which would not exist without chaos. The P.I. and his group recently developed a new framework of defining and characterizing both quantum and classical chaotic systems using a geometric approach. In the current project, the P.I. will focus on universal (model independent) aspects of chaos focusing on least studied intermediate and long-time behavior of such systems. A special focus will be on finding similarities and differences between quantum and classical chaotic systems.<br/><br/>The second thrust is focused on the interplay between fast quantum and slow classical degrees of freedom. A colloquial example is a bucket with water. When classical bucket quickly rotates, the quantum water molecules form a new equilibrium state where water stays in the bucket even when it is upside down. This happens because quantum and classical degrees of freedom cannot be easily separated from each other forming a joint synchronized motion. While this example with rotations is of course well understood, for more complex motions like crystal vibrations, the existing theoretical framework, known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), is insufficient. The PI and collaborators have just developed a new general approach allowing one to systematically go beyond the BOA and describe such systems. In the current project PI plans to apply this approach to specific setups relevant to materials and other experimental platforms.<br/><br/>The main broader impact is a commitment to finish a new graduate level textbook on quantum mechanics with the expected completion date in mid-2026. The book (co-authored with M. Rigol and P. Claeys) gives a new perspective on quantum physics shifting focus from understanding atomic orbitals to concepts relevant for understanding modern technology. The PI, also actively continues training students at all levels and performing extra curriculum teaching at various US and international short-term schools.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education into quantum mechanical systems of interacting particles far from equilibrium. The research part of this proposal has two main themes: i) understanding quantum and classical chaos and ergodicity through adiabatic transformations and ii) systematic expansion of dynamics of systems with joint classical and quantum degrees of freedom beyond Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA).<br/><br/>As it was shown by PI and collaborators adiabatic transformations connect into a single framework many seemingly different phenomena like emergence of local conservation laws, Schrieffer-Wolff transformations, Floquet Hamiltonians, short and long-time dynamics and operator growth, quantum chaos and ergodicity, design of fast and efficient quantum annealing protocols and quantum thermal machines. There also emerged new ideas, which will be central to this proposal like connecting quantum and classical chaos/ergodicity into a single framework, universal dynamics of systems close to integrability, and a systematic approach allowing one to go beyond the BOA for describing systems with quantum and classical degrees of freedom like molecules or electron-phonon systems. Using this approach PI also plans to study emergent nonequilibrium steady states as states approximately equilibrating in the moving frame and, in particular, to understand how these non-perturbative states affect macroscopic physical observables like transport coefficients. PI will continue close interactions with experimental groups to test these theoretical ideas in various setups such as cold atoms, trapped ions, NV-centers, superconducting qubits, and various other quantum simulators.<br/> <br/>The main broader impact is a commitment to finish a new graduate level textbook on quantum mechanics with the expected completion date in mid-2026.

For example, looking very closely at foam materials that are often used for packaging reveals that they consist of many tiny randomly oriented struts. This project will generate strategically oriented struts to perform a desired deformation when people interact with it. In the floor example, structures that soften upon a large impact, such as a person falling, will be generated. Similarly, material structures to provide ergonomic support can be computed, such as a chair cushion that becomes thicker in the back when people sit down to promote an upright posture. Such materials can also be tailored to people's bodies, for example, as assistive braces for rehabilitation that can adapt their stiffness with every step.<br/><br/>The scientific aims of this project are to understand when and how users will interact with such adaptive materials and how to design and fabricate them. Materials governed by their microstructures (also known as mechanical metamaterials) with designed bulk behavior have been investigated in engineering disciplines yet a deeper understanding of their human-centered qualities is missing, for example, their capabilities for interaction, user needs, or utility. To approach such interactive passive materials systematically, this project will address three classes of challenges. The first challenge is understanding how users will interact with the materials. The second challenge is developing advanced computational design tools that optimize new structures and allow them to be shared, evaluated, and reused. The final challenge is the long-term integration and in-depth user evaluations of applications. The project will first create a robust analysis of application domains and user evaluations of initial prototypes, resulting in a new design space that characterizes the material-changing interfaces. Based on these findings, libraries of structures and computational design tools will be built to foster a growing repository of designs and associated performance evaluations, enhancing collaborative opportunities and innovation in the field. With this foundational framework, design tool, and evaluation protocols, application areas will be investigated in-depth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Learning about statistics concepts requires understanding how statistics and data are used in to interpret and describe patterns in real world situations. As middle and high school math classes include more statistics, teachers will need support in developing knowledge and resources for teaching statistical concepts and applications. In any learning context, students draw on their own knowledge and experience to understand new topics and concepts. This project will engage students and teachers in finding meaningful ways to use statistical reasoning to make data-based arguments and reason about patterns they observe in society. This CAREER award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The project examines the development of statistical literacy that combines statistical reasoning and thinking. The focus is in designing and refining an empirical theory of change for supporting the development of teachers? statistical literacy. In this case a critical statistical literacy also includes how students learn about statistics in ways that are grounded in their experience and understanding of the world. Statistical literacy for students and teachers helps interpret and explain social phenomena using data collection and analysis. Students should be prepared to develop data-based arguments for interpreting and explaining real phenomenon. The project will use professional learning communities for teachers to learn about statistical literacy and develop learning experiences for their students. The research will examine teachers? knowledge development and their use of statistical learning experiences for students. The data collection includes quantitative and qualitative sources. These include video analysis of the professional learning communities, measures of teachers? statistical knowledge, and evidence from classroom interactions with students. <br/><br/>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The upper atmosphere above 100 km altitude consists of electrically neutral gases as well as electrically charged ions and free electrons. The neutral component is called the thermosphere, and the charged components are called the ionosphere. The ionosphere significantly alters the propagation of radio waves passing through it, including communication and navigation signals transmitted from satellites. Because of their impacts on radio propagation, understanding the processes creating structures in the ionosphere is a critical part of space weather research.  This research will be conducted with numerical models of the coupled thermosphere and ionosphere as well as analysis of ionospheric data from radars and the global positioning system.  The project will support a graduate student and the models will be open-source to the community. Results of the project will be used to create classroom examples of ionospheric phenomena for use in undergraduate and graduate classes at UCLA.<br/><br/>The polar cap ionosphere contains a variety of mesoscale (100-1000 km) electron density structures, including polar cap patches and tongues of ionization. The electron density gradients associated with these structures can drive plasma instabilities and severely affect radio propagation at high latitudes. The polar cap ionosphere is also the source of significant ion outflow to the magnetosphere, and the polar wind reflects the structuring of the high-latitude ionosphere. Magnetospheric energy inputs drive significant variations in the high-latitude neutral thermosphere. This project will examine ion-neutral coupling processes at high latitudes to understand how the thermospheric dynamics affect the electron density structures and associated ion outflow. The specific science questions to be addressed are (1) How do thermospheric density and composition changes during geomagnetic storms affect the formation and evolution of high-latitude electron density structures? and (2) How do thermospheric variations modulate the supply of ion upflow and outflow?  These questions will be addressed with controlled numerical experiments coupling the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model 3.0 (TIEGCM 3.0) model of the neutral thermosphere to the High-latitude Ionospheric Dynamics for Research Applications (HIDRA) model of the high-latitude ionosphere and polar wind. The team will contrast simulations using the coupled model to simulations using a static thermosphere to isolate ion neutral coupling effects. They will compare the simulation results to observations of high-latitude density structures from incoherent scatter radars (e.g. RISR) and GPS total electron content observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will test how categorical forensic decisions may contribute to wrongful convictions and identify ways to reduce their harm to the innocent. Wrongful conviction is a serious problem within the US criminal legal system, with far-reaching societal and economic consequences. Invalid forensic analysis is one cause of the problem; however, even valid forensic analysis can contribute to miscarriages of justice if forensic experts unwittingly miscommunicate the meaning of their findings to legal decision makers. Categorical forensic decisions, though seemingly straightforward, have the potential to convey more or less culpability than the physical forensic evidence actually supports. When this happens, innocent people can be convicted and guilty people can go free, eroding trust in the legal system, threatening public safety, and wasting valuable economic resources. This project will promote the fair administration of justice by helping to transform how forensic decisions are reported, understood, and used throughout the criminal legal system and provide opportunities to mentor students and an early career researcher and to foster the engagement of a variety of students in the research process.<br/><br/>This three-year project includes five experiments and a continuing legal education component designed for attorneys and judges. Grounded in sender-receiver models of the communication process, the laboratory experiments will (1) test whether categorical forensic decisions encourage miscommunication between forensic experts and prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, (2) demonstrate whether an alternative forensic reporting metric can help forensic experts to more effectively communicate their findings to legal decision makers, and (3) examine the effectiveness of expert testimony for clarifying the meaning of categorical forensic decisions for jurors and juries.

Tracing fossil remains over time helps us understand evolutionary processes, extinction events, and shifts in geographic patterns of organisms, especially in response to environmental changes such as warming events, ice ages, and shifts between wet and arid climates.  Linking past shifts with alterations in the types, abundances and distributions of species can provide clues of the potential impacts of future changes. The majority of fossil discoveries are of plants and animals, which represent a small slice of life forms on Earth. The vast majority of species and genetic diversity are found in microscopic forms, including organisms called protists. Despite the importance of these tiny organisms, their use in understanding the impacts of environmental change is severely limited because very few fossil records exist. Over the past three decades, the PI has uncovered numerous fossil deposits rich in these microscopic organisms that span millions of years of geologic time, and significant periods of environmental change. The objective of this work is to synthesize the extensive body of information on past microscopic life, with the goals of improving the ability of scientists to model future impacts of environmental changes on Earth?s ecosystems, and to better understand evolutionary patterns of these microbes.  A broader impact of this work will include securing and archiving the extensive fossil collection, and associated data, in an established museum to benefit future exploration of these important organisms.<br/><br/>Being an OPUS award, this project is synthesis driven, using an extensive fossil database of freshwater microfossil species established using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of hundreds of rock samples from numerous North American sites.  Samples and specimens were derived from rocks taken from deep drilled cores, numerous outcrops, and subsamples of rock matrices from plant and animal macrofossils archived at multiple museums. The sites span 82 million years of geologic history dating from the Cretaceous.  Documentation of new species, morphological traits, and estimates of environmental conditions will be determined for each protist group represented in the fossil collection.  Next, a comparative synthesis of the diversity, distribution, ecology and morphological form across all groups will be made.  The synthesis will also evaluate the potential of each protist group to migrate under different climate scenarios, their use as bioindicators, the extent of evolutionary change, and provide estimates of minimum age constraints for use in molecular phylogenetic studies.

In this NSF-SNSF research proposal and in collaboration with the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (Geneva, Switzerland), the researchers will develop an exciting new soft ABI technology that overcomes the problems of the clinical device in both mice and non-human primate. <br/><br/>The goals of this collaborative proposal will focus on advancing the technology for soft ABIs that will enable minimally invasive surgical insertion, accurate positioning over the cochlear nucleus (CN) and spatially selective modulation of central auditory pathways.  The U.S. researchers will deploy the soft ABI in rodent and nonhuman primate (NHP) models to gain complementary knowledge in electrical modulation of the CN and pursue the translation of the soft neurotechnology. Aim 1 of this project is to develop novel soft auditory brainstem implant (ABI) electrode arrays. The goal is to increase the conformability of the surface electrode array on the brainstem and miniaturize the electrodes to improve neuromodulation performance. Mechanically compliant soft ABI electrode arrays based on thin-film technology will be manufactured and systematically tested to determine the stability and integrity of the electrode implants, aiming for year-long function in vivo. Aim 2 of the project will test the soft ABI array for durability and performance in a chronic mouse model before the soft ABI is eventually used in valuable NHP models and in first studies in humans beyond the scope of this project. Performance of the mice will be assessed by behavioral tests to determine sensitivity to amplitude modulation (AM) of the electrical pulse train. This metric is chosen because, in human patients who use the ABI, it correlates best with speech comprehension. Aim 3 will test soft ABI arrays in nonhuman primate (NHP). The Boston and Swiss team will jointly implant 3 NHPs at the Swiss Non-Human Primates Competence Center for Research (SPCCR). The electrode array design will be tested and optimized, in biomimetic models prior to NHP surgery. Following chronic NHP implantation, the research team will perform assays of implant durability, record maps of activation by sound sequences on the CN and auditory cortex, and compare these activation maps to silence. Cortical maps activated by selective stimulation on the CN with the soft ABI will be collected and compared to auditory only stimulation. The introduction of soft, microfabricated ABIs has the potential to profoundly transform the landscape of neuroprosthetic interventions to enhance auditory perception. With their refined design, these advanced implants can achieve targeted stimulation of specific neural clusters within the cochlear nucleus, the target of the ABI. This precision can result in improved quality of perceived sound, increased speech intelligibility and reduced side effects. The resultant improvements will greatly elevate the overall quality of life among patients who have retrocochlear deafness.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they are also a significant source of harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species, which can damage mitochondrial DNA and impair cellular function. This damage is further exacerbated by external factors like pollution, potentially leading to a myriad of maladies. This project aims to enhance the natural repair mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA by improving the targeting of key repair enzymes to mitochondria without disrupting their other cellular roles. In addition to advancing fundamental knowledge, this research fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, engages students and researchers at all levels, and promotes outreach efforts to inspire the next generation of scientists. The dovetailing of cutting-edge computational modeling and experimental methods will allow exploration of innovative ways to protect mitochondrial health while contributing to future strategies to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction.<br/><br/>This project addresses a critical gap in the understanding of mitochondrial base excision repair (mtBER), a pathway essential for maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity in the face of oxidative damage. The project will focus on re-engineering the mitochondrial localization signals of five DNA glycosylases that specifically excise oxidized DNA damage, namely OGG1, NTHL1, NEIL1, NEIL2, and NEIL3 to improve their targeting to mitochondria while preserving their nuclear localization. A novel computational framework will be used to optimize mitochondrial targeting signals through sequence modifications that enhance mitochondrial import efficiency. The re-engineered glycosylases will be validated experimentally for localization and their enzymatic activity assessed through biochemical assays. The functional impact of enhanced mitochondrial localization will be evaluated by examining oxidative damage repair capacity, mtDNA stability, and mitochondrial function. Overall, this research will address the extent to which glycosylase trafficking to the mitochondria could serve a protective role against oxidized DNA damage and improve repair, offering critical insights into the mechanisms safeguarding mitochondrial integrity. This project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are health concerns caused by breathing in fumes of hydrogen sulfide, as well as concerns about adverse health effects from the particulate sulfate that can be formed from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. It is important to measure the concentration of these toxic compounds in the river water and determine the related amounts in the air during wintertime periods of low precipitation before the spring rains dilute their concentrations. This work will address important issues regarding the emissions of acutely and chronically harmful substances being discharged into the river and subsequently released into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This project focuses on time and location dependent water-phase concentration data and modeling of the air-to-water emissions of important volatilizable compounds from the Tijuana River system. This data will be used with other information needed for estimating overall air-liquid mass transfer coefficients based on (a) the liquid-side resistance values (as determined primarily by flow velocity and depth regimes); and (b) the air-side resistance (as determined primarily by wind velocity regimes). The relative magnitudes of the two resistances are affected by the compound itself and temperature-dependent Henry?s Gas Law Constant.  Researchers from the University of California at San Diego and the University of California at Riverside will collaborate on efforts that use river water concentration data with temperature-dependent Henry?s Gas Law Constant values, flow rate and depth data/estimates, and meteorological wind data to estimate temporally dependent emissions from the Tijuana River system to the San Diego/Tijuana air shed for use in air quality modeling. The knowledge gained from this work will inform the understanding of the air quality affecting populations at widely different scales, ranging from those who live and work in the local area, to the region surrounding and including the city of San Diego, and ultimately to the entire area affected by the transport of these emissions into other regions of the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mineral dust deposited on snow and ice surfaces darkens the surface, causing it to absorb more energy from the sun and accelerate snow and ice melt. This process creates a cycle: exposed dusty surfaces release more dust into the atmosphere, increasing dust deposition and driving further melt. Currently, there are few observations of dust deposition on snow and glaciers in the Arctic. This project will investigate dust deposition on glaciers in Svalbard, one of the fastest-warming regions in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising five to seven times faster than the global average. By studying Svalbard, scientists hope to better understand what might happen in other parts of the Arctic and how these changes could contribute to rising sea levels that have global impacts. Two M.S. students and three undergraduate students will be trained at a regional comprehensive university. This project will advance STEM education, engage the public, and strengthen international research partnerships and knowledge exchange.<br/> <br/>The objectives of this research are: 1) Determine the spatial and temporal variability of dust deposition onto Svalbard glaciers, and factors driving dust deposition; 2) Discern the sources of dust; 3) Assess the contribution of dust and black carbon to snow and glacier melt processes; 4) Investigate recent trends in dust deposition, and 5) Apply findings to enhance understanding of dust-cryosphere feedbacks in the Arctic. Fieldwork will consist of collecting ice cores from six spatially distributed Svalbard glaciers to provide multi-year records of light absorbing particle deposition. Laboratory work will include mineral dust characterization and black carbon analyses. Remote sensing will be used to assess dust deposition across Svalbard snow and glaciers, and snow albedo and glacier melt modelling will be done to assess the relative contribution of dust and black carbon to albedo reductions and melt.

One possibility is that these signals are combined on the basis of spatial location. In most of our natural experience, the source of sensory signals that are related come from the same location, making it an ideal basis on which to integrate information to form a coherent perception of the world around us. The work proposed here aims to test whether spatial location serves this function for visual and auditory attention.

The project also includes the development of an EEG methods boot camp and other outreach efforts that may aid in workforce development and increase public awareness of the research. <br/><br/>In detail, prior research demonstrating spatial selectively for both visual and auditory attention has often been taken as evidence for a ?supra-modal? spatial attention system that is tuned to operate similarly across the different senses. The current proposal aims to test key tenets of this spatial attention theory focusing on audiovisual interactions using a combination of psychophysics and EEG. First, it aims to examine the time course of spatial exogenous attention and assesses whether cross-modal attention follows similar temporal dynamics as unimodal attention.  Second, it aims to investigate the interactions between exogenous cross-modal attention and endogenous, sustained visual-spatial selection. Finally, the proposed works aims to quantify how selection history in one modality (e.g., audition) affects the spatial prioritization in another modality (e.g., vision) using incidental learning paradigms. The results of the proposed studies have the potential to bring forward a new understanding of how multimodal information is processed and integrated in the brain to support effective stimulus processing, advancing current models of attention and multisensory integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when seeing a group of people for the first time, some names and faces may easily stick in memory, while others fade away even after several meetings. Indeed, recent work has found that images, voices, and words have an inherent memorability?where some are more easily remembered than others, across people. This universality in memory means that one can make honed predictions of what people will remember, based on the events they are experiencing. Further, this universality suggests shared mechanisms across people that determines what information is saved into memory. However, it is still unknown what causes an item to be memorable?prior work suggests that it is not one singular factor (e.g., attractiveness) or a combination of factors, but instead something deeper about how the brain processes information. This project tests three major theories about what determines an item?s memorability, with the goal of answering how brains prioritize what should be saved in memory versus what should be discarded. Testing and understanding these theories makes memory more predictable?allowing for the creation of textbooks with easy-to-remember images, better diagnostic tests of Alzheimer?s disease, or art exhibits that leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>These three main theories will be tested using converging methods in behavioral experiments, brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI), and artificial intelligence (AI). The first theory poses that brains organize memories in maps, and memorability reflects where an item is in that map. In other words, memorable items may be in more central, accessible locations, while forgettable items are on the less accessible outskirts. This hypothesis is tested using computational models testing the structure of these maps and how they relate to actual memory. The second theory poses that memorable items are those that are easiest for the brain to process?in other words, if it is easy to process, it is easier to save in memory. This theory is tested by looking at measures of cognitive effort (using behavior and eye-tracking methods) and testing if AI models also show similar effects. Finally, the third theory poses that this ?memorability effect? reflects an important computation of the brain that happens between perceiving information and saving it into memory. This hypothesis is tested using fMRI scans to see how the brain represents memorable items and how it changes with task, stimulus type, and familiarity. In addition to experiments in the laboratory, this project also tests memory theories in more real-world settings.

These genes emerged independently, and were selected for, in several populations where milk was a central food staple. This study examines the genetic, microbiome, and cultural factors that allow adult milk digestion among groups of peoples that are milk-dependent but lack LP genes. Additionally, the study examines whether genes that impact lactose tolerance co-evolved with those that permit the metabolization of high levels of milk-derived sugars.

Cutting-edge functional genomics approaches enable the identification of novel enhancer regions near the lactase gene and near genes involved with sugar metabolism. Genetic data integration allows for the identification of novel genetic variants influencing lactase persistence. Lactose tolerance tests are applied in tandem with a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel genetic loci linked to milk-induced blood sugar level increases. Gut microbiome sequencing enables the identification of bacteria that aid in digesting lactose and quantifies the extent to which milk preparation practices shape the composition of the gut microbiome.

When we walk through a park we not only see a rich visual world, we also hear sounds ranging from birds tweeting to the conversations taking place around us. All of this information has meaning, informing us about the structure of our current world, how it is likely to immediately change, and how we might best respond adaptively to it. Sounds are an important source of information for daily life. Sounds alert us to danger, they allow us to navigate to targets that cannot be seen, and they help us to know where we are in the environment. To use this information, the brain must both correctly identify sounds and integrate them with other sources of information to support ongoing cognitive functioning. The proposed work seeks to understand how the brain extracts meaning from sound and how the process is integrated with those used to extract meaning from other senses, primarily vision. The project also aims to provide advanced training to both graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in cutting-edge empirical, analytical, and modelling approaches. <br/><br/>In detail, the project aims to test an hypothesis about how meaning is extracted from sounds using fMRI. The auditory semantic alignment hypothesis proposes that a set of cortical areas accomplish this extraction through a dual-specialization for auditory processing and particular categories of sounds. These areas are proposed to extract particular types of information from certain categories of sound and pass that information onto a broader semantic network that is amodal, integrating over the senses. Evidence for a similar system has been observed in visual processing. If a homologous structure is observed for auditory processing, it would suggest a general mechanism for extracting meaning from external stimuli. The proposed work has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how our cortical responses support our perception and adaptation to a dynamic natural world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to thrive in diverse environments is in part due to microbes? ability to convert diverse energy sources into cellular energy, often via multiple branched electron transport chains. Cytochromes c (cyt c) are a key component of most electron transport chains and much effort has been devoted to understanding the diverse roles of individual cyt c isoforms. Over one hundred different cyt c have been identified, yet all are made in the same way, a process called cyt c biogenesis. Despite the large number and diversity in function of cyt c, only three pathways exist to make it: System I (prokaryotes), System II (prokaryotes), and System III (eukaryotes). Understanding how these three pathways function is a fundamental biological question that is still not well understood. This project will obtain a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the bacterial System II cyt c biogenesis pathway through structure-function analysis. The team integrates undergraduate researchers into the project via direct participation in the research objectives. Additional educational opportunities from this project include classroom experiences to expand undergraduate knowledge, both of research and of STEM careers. These activities will increase STEM identity as a way to improve retention in STEM, leading to a more multitalented STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Cyt c biogenesis requires the covalent attachment of heme to a conserved motif on cyt c. This project focuses on the bacterial System II cyt c biogenesis pathway composed of two proteins, CcsB/A, proposed to be a bi-functional enzyme for transmembrane heme transport and attachment to cyt c. Comparison of System II proteins across bacteria has determined that CcsB/A?s have low sequence identity, can be encoded with different genetic arrangements and exhibit variability in protein size and predicted structure. Therefore, a comparative study of System II pathways will be undertaken to 1) determine if holocytochrome c synthase function is conserved despite protein variability and 2) elucidate the System II/cytochrome c interaction domain to determine specificity of heme attachment.

These in-depth structure-function studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of System II, provide tools that can be expanded for the study of the other cytochrome c biogenesis pathways and lay the foundation for future studies to probe the regulation and impact of cyt c biogenesis in the context of bacterial metabolism and bioenergetics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

De minimis imports refer to the import of goods with a value below a certain limit, considered too small to be subject to taxes or customs duties. In the U.S., the 1930 Tariff Act arranges de minimis trade limits and allows people to import up to $800 worth of goods per day without duties or customs burden. De minimis imports in the U.S. form an increasingly important channel through which consumers and small businesses source their spending. The share of de minimis imports in total consumer imports and total e-commerce sales has grown continuously. This research builds and extends an economic framework that uses new data sources, including international shipments into the U.S. handled by three shipping carriers, to answer various research questions, such as How does the existence of de minimis policies affect firms and consumers? Which consumers are the largest beneficiaries of direct imports, and of de minimis imports? What are the implications of changing the de minimis rule and how would these effects vary across consumer types, and what is an optimal de minimis threshold? The research findings have the potential to inspire new trade policy designs, enhance the welfare of U.S. consumers and businesses, and help maintain the U.S.'s position as a global leader in international trade. <br/><br/>This award funds a research project to develop a quantitative trade framework where consumers have heterogeneous preferences across commodities of different value, and where firms are heterogeneous with respect to productivity and quality. Firms optimize over prices while considering incentives to avoid paying taxes. A range of firms who would have otherwise priced above the tax notch lower prices, implying a source of terms of trade gains for the country imposing de minimis. The empirical analysis identifies the relevant elasticity parameters of the model by leveraging the observed bunching in the distribution of shipment values at the tax notch created by de minimis policies, drawing parallels to methods used in public economics to analyze labor supply elasticities. The combination of the model and estimated parameters is used to determine the aggregate, distributional consequences, and efficiency of de minimis policies, and to gauge the welfare effects of direct low-value shipments more broadly. Additionally, by extending their framework, the researchers answer important research questions concerning the global impacts of de minimis rules and their impacts on firms. This research could enable researchers and decisionmakers to better evaluate the value of de minimis trade, the impact of trade policies on these imports, and their effects on participant welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Driven by regulatory and customer pressure, the textile industry will require at least ~15,000 MT per year of rPET from 2025 onward, a potential $22.5B market. Most valuable is textile-derived rPET, in which clothing feedstock is made from clothing waste. Despite strong demand, this product is currently unavailable for purchase due to technical challenges. The proposed technology is a patent-pending, low-cost wash process that transforms mixed textile waste into purified feedstock at cost parity with virgin material. Along with the ability to remove elastane (a common barrier for textile recycling), the technology?s ultra-low cost provides a durable competitive advantage as a ?green? product that does not demand a ?green premium?. This proposal bridges a critical gap toward bringing this technology from bench-top to market via the development of downstream manufacturing processes and quality standards for textile-derived recycled materials. This project enables an initial market offering of 1 ton/month, providing a critical milestone toward construction 1-3 full commercial scale plants by 2030 and recycling 450,000 tons of waste textiles per year.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables production of textile-derived recycled polyester feedstock, a highly desired but unavailable material for textile manufacturing. Textile recycling is an immature industry limited by a lack of technical solutions for complex material challenges - circular textile recycling, in which textile waste is captured and transformed into re-usable feedstock, currently accounts for less than 1% of total mass flow of textiles. Among the most significant challenges is the ability to successfully transform complex mixtures of multiple fiber types into a single-component feedstock. Our novel process is a transformational technology for polyester recycling, capable of removing contaminants such as elastane, dyes, and other additives from mixed fiber polyester (PET) textile waste, resulting in pure, undyed polyester raw materials. This Phase II project enables the transformation of this intermediate material into market-ready feedstock by examining the critical material features that contribute quality metrics by which the market evaluates and selects feedstock products. The completion of this grant will represent a significant milestone toward our goal to divert over 150,000 tons of textile waste annually from landfills, facilitating a truly circular economy for synthetic textiles, and providing enhanced supply chain security with sustainable materials for apparel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, however, we have come to understand that the dynamics of a protein are essential to its function.  More tools are needed to examine protein dynamics. In this research, the investigator will seek to apply a method of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy developed in his lab to diverse biological molecules of eminent interest in medicine, in collaboration with three renowned scientific laboratories, thus broadening the utility of this important tool for studying protein dynamics.  The method involves rapidly mixing two components of a reaction, allowing the reaction to proceed for a controlled length of time, then rapidly freezing the sample for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Time-resolved cryo-EM will show the progression of a biochemical reaction as a sequence of intermediate states, like successive frames of a movie. The application of this method in the life sciences will greatly expand our understanding of molecular interactions in the cell in healthy persons, as well as their disruption in disease. This research is truly interdisciplinary as it is at the intersection of biology, biomedical engineering, nanofabrication, microfluidics and high-performance computing.  As such it will inform molecular medicine and inspire projects for graduate students in the labs of the collaborators and nation-wide as it opens avenues of research and training in health science research never explored before.<br/><br/>Using newly designed PDMS-based microfluidic chips, the PI's team will apply the time-resolved cryo-EM sample preparation method, which his lab has developed and demonstrated with the ribosome, to a diverse range of other molecules: (1) RNA polymerase, a large molecule that copies the genetic information from DNA to make mRNA; (2) GLP1R, a G-protein coupled receptor found on beta cells of the pancreas and neurons of the brain; and (3) multi-drug efflux transporter AcrB, to be isolated and inserted into proteoliposomes.  Although the structures of these molecules are known, their mode of action involving domain motions in the time range of 10 to 1000 milliseconds cannot be explored with normal methods of structure research.  Time-resolved cryo-EM can fill this knowledge gap. Samples will be supplied by three collaborating labs, and feasibility of determining intermediate states in the functional cycle will be explored.

Madagascar exemplifies biodiversity hotspots: it is home to an extraordinary number of species restricted to small, localized areas on this Indian Ocean island. This project will test three possible explanations of how these biodiversity hotspots formed in members of the tree genus Diospyros (the source of valuable ebony wood) by examining their evolutionary relationships and calculating how sensitive a species is to environmental conditions. A better understanding of these processes will help explain why some parts of the world have exceptionally high levels of biological diversity, why so many species only occur in very limited areas, and how we can better conserve them. This project will also provide educational and training opportunities to graduate students and high school students, giving them foundational tools to contribute to the scientific workforce and develop into future leaders in STEM fields. <br/> <br/>This research will leverage existing DNA bank material and conduct targeted field sampling to generate a robust, time-calibrated phylogeny of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) from Madagascar and surrounding regions using the Angiosperm 353 target enrichment probe set. The resulting phylogeny will be used to: 1) determine the biogeographic origins of Malagasy Diospyros, 2) produce a unifying taxonomic framework for all Malagasy Diospyros species along with practical, interactive digital identification tools, and 3) conduct the very first head-to-head comparison of three competing hypotheses of island biodiversity and microendemism on Madagascar. Specifically, researchers will assess support for these hypotheses by: 1) quantifying species niche breadth using novel phylogenetically-informed species distribution models, 2) conducting phylo-spatial tests of endemism and phylogenetic turnover, and 3) examining patterns of niche conservatism and shifts in the rate of diversification through time.

Nematocytes, the stinging cells found only in cnidarians (corals, jellyfish, and their relatives), are an important model for understanding the origin of novelty. Nematocytes derive their sting from their ability to eject a tiny, venom-laden harpoon from a pressurized compartment inside a cell. The compartment, and the harpoon it contains, are constructed of an unusual protein called minicollagen, which is also found only in cnidarians. Recent advances in genome sequencing have greatly improved our ability to detect novel protein-coding sequences from DNA; still, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of how novel proteins (like minicollagen) give rise to novel traits (like the nematocyte). To address this gap, the proposed work is characterizing the protein-protein interactions necessary for the development of the stinging apparatus in diverse types of nematocytes. Additionally, to understand how novel protein-coding sequences acquire adaptive functions, this work is investigating the processes that direct proteins to their proper locations inside the cell. Ultimately, these investigations will enable the development of designer cells with traits that have never come together naturally. The educational goal of this research is to better prepare undergraduate students to pursue careers in integrative research through development of a research-based lab course in evolutionary cell biology. This research is also increasing public science literacy by providing new and innovative learning resources to STEM educators and museum visitors.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this work is to develop a framework for predicting the emergence of novel traits from novel protein-coding genes by investigating the processes that drove the emergence of the nematocyte. To achieve this goal, the proposed work is using mass spectroscopy and proteomic analysis to characterize how unique nematocyte types emerge from taxon-specific interactions among novel proteins (Aim 1). Additionally, using genome engineering to alter protein localization, the proposed work is reconstructing the order of events that permitted the fixation of the nematocyte-specific protein minicollagen in the stem cnidarian genome (Aim 2). Collectively, this work is revealing how functional interactions among novel proteins drive the emergence of novel traits. This work will advance our ability to predict the fate of novel proteins and contribute significantly to explaining cases of novelty that arise de novo from new genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigating the reaction dynamics taking place during the CID of post-translationally modified peptides and nucleosides is challenging because these modifications enable new chemical reactions to take place that cannot occur in their unmodified counterparts. In addition, these modifications can prevent common chemical reactions that take place in unmodified peptides and nucleosides. Professor Barnes and his students will employ sophisticated simulation techniques that are analyzed using graph theory and ab initio calculations to study chemically diverse model systems where tandem mass spectrometry data is already available. A modernized simulation software package will be released to the community that can utilize artificial intelligence (AI) based potential energy surfaces. Their studies could result in reports of the first simulations of the CID of nucleosides and a user-friendly CID simulation software package made available to the community.

Direct dynamics simulations provide an abundance of atomic-level information, allowing for the elucidation of the most relevant mechanistic steps involved in CID reactions. Advanced analysis techniques that rely on graph theory allow for chemical insight to be easily extracted from this data. Once relevant reaction pathways are identified through direct dynamics simulation, electronic structure calculations will be employed to provide reliable energetics. A comparison to experimental data will be made when possible. The data obtained will provide the community with information regarding preferred reaction mechanics in a broad range of CID systems.

This project will furthermore explore rDNA copy number variation in the context of dysregulated cell function, using conditions of altered ribosome regulation or compromised small RNA gene regulation. A discovery-based undergraduate research course will provide students with training in single guide RNA cloning and application of a CRISPR-activation approach to overexpress target genes in rDNA copy number variant backgrounds. Students will train in hypothesis-based investigation, molecular techniques, and organismal phenotyping to assess the consequences of rDNA copy number variation in altered cellular environments.

It looks at whether the location of genes in a genome makes them more likely to help keep species separate. This is important because biologists can better predict how biodiversity is generated and preserved if the same parts of the genome are used in different speciation events. At the same time, this project combines research, education, and outreach to support biology education in the U.S., build student confidence in science, and contribute to the development of a skilled STEM workforce. It will train graduate and undergraduate students in research and mentorship, and the entire research team will visit middle school classrooms to improve public understanding of science and the natural world. Finally, this project will find useful traits in wild sunflowers, which could help make sunflower farming more sustainable and improve global food security. By pursuing these objectives, this project will also create a unique opportunity to integrate multiple levels of mentees into the research process. To achieve this, the project will include the development of a hands-on, inquiry-based module for first-year undergraduate students to explore assortative mating in sunflowers through genotyping offspring that will be incorporated into an existing course-based research experience (CURE). In addition, the research team will initiate a multifaceted operation that links existing research, professional development, and outreach experiences for small cohorts of undergraduate students. Briefly, this initiative will include recruiting students from the CURE class, transitioning them into a summer research program, pairing the students with graduate student mentees to continue their research, including the student-mentee pairs middle school outreach, and finally facilitating professional development opportunities.<br/><br/>This project explores the interaction of parallel evolution, structural variants (SVs), and the evolution of reproductive barriers using dune sunflowers as a model system to examine speciation. Previous work has shown that SVs facilitate parallel adaptation to sand dunes in sunflowers and that dune adaptation results in reproductive barriers, suggesting that SVs facilitate parallel speciation. To test this hypothesis, three primary research questions will be addressed: (1) How and why does assortative mating evolve between sunflower ecotypes? (2) Does parallel evolution lead to parallel speciation? (3) How broadly can SVs facilitate parallel evolution? These questions will be answered by phenotyping 200 individuals from 26 sunflower populations and species that span a range of environments from the dune core, to the dune edge, to non-dune populations. It will connect genotype to phenotype to fitness using GWAS, and measure components of reproductive isolation using crosses from populations with and among the same and different habitat types.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Alaska-Aleutian arc, USA in particular poses high threats to a global aviation community due to its frequently active volcanoes (~2 eruptions and 6 unrest episodes per year) and its location beneath highly utilized North Pacific air routes. One avenue to strengthen the volcanology community?s ability to respond when unrest begins is to have a thorough understanding of the timescales of subsurface processes (e.g., magma movement) that have led to different size and styles of eruption (e.g., plume height). This progress can be accomplished through the integration of multiple datasets (petrology, gas geochemistry, seismology, geodesy) with near-real-time observations of volcanic unrest. Although significant advances have been made to understand the processes that fuel earthquakes and volcanic events in subduction zone centers over the past two decades, significant challenges remain with integrating different techniques for studying these systems (e.g., geophysics with petrology or gas emissions) as well as our ability to interpret the dense data streams collected during unrest events. To address these big picture needs, a three-day workshop will be held at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage, Alaska, to highlight specifically chosen datasets and questions that require attention by the broader volcanology community. <br/><br/>Part 2: Alaska is the most volcanically active region in the USA and one of the most active in the world. The high rate of volcanic activity, and along strike variations in subduction dynamics, provides an ideal laboratory to study the interplay between tectonic and volcanic processes. In May of 2025 a 3-day workshop will be hosted at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a consortium of the USGS, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and State of Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys, aimed at disseminating the current state of knowledge for potentially active volcanoes in Alaska and identifying compelling research directions. The high rates of volcanic activity in Alaska and the comprehensive data collected and archived by the Alaska Volcano Observatory make it the best place to study active volcanic processes at convergent-margin volcanoes in the United States. This is evidenced by several large-scale research efforts underway (PREEVENTS, AVERT) as well as proposed (CONVERSE, SZ4D) that see the benefit of studying the Alaska-Aleutian Arc. In addition, Alaska is home to other volcanoes, including recently restless Mount Edgecumbe and the massive and poorly understood Wrangell volcanic field. This as a crucial time for introducing interested scientists to the datasets and questions that are the highest priority for advancing the science pertaining to these active systems. By selecting datasets that answer crucial gaps in our knowledge, the community can tackle outstanding questions in this field and identify new mechanisms to advance our understanding of the drivers and timescales of processes within subduction zones that broadly fall into two fields: 1) improving our spatial reconstruction of the sub-surface systems that feed volcanic eruptions and 2) progress towards the interpretation and processing of datasets collected during volcanic unrest. Combining datasets allows for interdisciplinary, system-level questions to be asked and investigated, a crucial step to coordinating future efforts and resources, as well as centering science questions around solid, testable hypotheses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solid-state single-photon emitters experience detrimental decoherence caused by noise from spin, charge, and atomic vibrations. However, the relative contributions of these sources to decoherence and their atomistic origin are not well understood. Professor Utzat?s group will leverage a new type of spectroscopy based on quantum optics to disentangle the role of charge and spin noise in decoherence in single emitters within monolayers of boron nitride and quantum dots composed of metal halide perovskites. By accessing currently experimentally challenging timescales from picoseconds to nanoseconds, foundational insights into how the condensed-phase environment interferes with the transduction between electronic and photonic coherences will be uncovered. Further impact arises from the formulation of materials design principles aimed at suppressing decoherence, leading to higher-quality single-photon emitters. The program also supports the development of a quantum-educated U.S. workforce through an extracurricular science workshop for high school students.<br/><br/>Hong-Ou-Mandel spectroscopy compares the single-photon indistinguishability from solid-state emitters as a way to measure bath fluctuations on timescales ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds. Varying photon time separations are employed to disentangle the effects of photon scattering, spin noise, and charge noise on the loss of photon indistinguishability. This loss is probed through the reduction in time-dependent two-photon interference visibility, derived from second-order photon correlation measurements. The Utzat group will use this method to quantify the dephasing mechanisms of two emerging single-photon emitters: defects in hexagonal boron nitride and quantum dots made of lead-halide perovskites. Specific objectives include quantifying the contributions of different dephasing pathways and uncovering their atomistic origins through temperature- and field-dependent studies combined with theoretical modeling. The broader impacts of this work involve the development of tools that address a critical measurement gap in the timescales of single-emitter dynamics. This is important due to the universality of dephasing mechanisms in solid-state environments and the need for future quantum engineering at the single-emitter level. Students participating in this project will gain expertise in an array of principles and methods in quantum optics, which are highly relevant to advanced technology industries, including quantum sensing and quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today's information technologies utilize the electron charge as the primary carrier of information. However, the electron also carries a tiny angular momentum called spin that enables spintronics, which is the spin-based counterpart of familiar electronics. Two key phenomena in contemporary spintronics research are the spin-transfer torque, where flowing electrons interact with local magnetization in a material, and spin pumping, where a varying local magnetization generates a spin current. Spin-transfer torque underlies a host of novel technologies, such as magnetic random access memories that are already commercially available, and neuromorphic circuits for hardware-based artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Even though spintronic phenomena are fundamentally quantum in nature, the standard microscopic understanding of both spin torque and spin pumping is essentially a quantum-classical hybrid: Flowing electrons are treated quantum-mechanically while localized spins are treated as classical objects. This heretofore necessary simplification results in a number of unsolved puzzles when one tries to explain certain spintronic experiments. These puzzles can be traced to quantum effects where quantum entanglement stands out. Entanglement is one of the most remarkable features of the quantum world whereby in a system of just two entangled quantum particles (e.g., two electron spins) what happens to one of them instantaneously determines what happens to the other one, even if they are arbitrarily far away from each other. The overarching goal of this project is to open new avenues for spintronics by bringing entanglement effects into the realm of spin-torque and spin-pumping phenomena. In turn, and in addition to resolving existing puzzles, this will make it possible to design novel protocols for probing quantum magnetic materials via the extensive toolbox of experimental techniques developed for spintronics over the past three decades.<br/><br/>In addition to the development of theoretical methods and open-source software for modeling spin transport in quantum materials, the project will also include advanced training for graduate students, preparing them for a productive participation in the nation's quantum workforce. The project will also provide opportunities for high-school students from Delaware and neighboring states to work on magnetism research projects and prepare them for competitions in math, science, and technology.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The dynamics of localized spins within magnets in contemporary spintronics, driven out of equilibrium by injecting current or by applying external fields, relies on the celebrated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation that considers their local magnetization as a classical vector. The applicability of the LLG equation demands that the underlying quantum state of localized spins must remain unentangled. However, several experiments in spintronics involving particular antiferromagnetic layers cannot be explained by LLG dynamics. This suggests the presence of mixed entangled quantum states of many spins within nonequilibrium antiferromagnets, despite their interaction with the inevitable dissipative environment.<br/><br/>The project will develop theories to explain experimental puzzles in antiferromagnetic spintronics, as well as in current-driven atomic and molecular spins on surfaces as a smaller version of quantum spin systems that can serve as testbed for new method development. These predictions can then be exploited to design experiments where spin torque and spin pumping are used to probe exotic magnetic quantum matter. Such matter notably includes quantum spin liquids, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractionalized excitations, whose confirmation and control is highly sought as a resource for topological quantum computing. The theory developed in this project will also guide experiments toward direct quantification of entanglement of antiferromagnets or quantum spin liquids, but via table-top experiments suitable for two-dimensional and/or nonequilibrium materials where neutron scattering becomes inapplicable. These activities will require construction of new theoretical methods to study the fundamental problem of quantum transport of spin and charge in strongly interacting boundary-driven systems that are coupled to different baths at their edges.<br/><br/>In addition to the development of theoretical methods and open-source software for modeling spin transport in quantum materials, the project will also include advanced training for graduate students, preparing them for a productive participation in the nation's quantum workforce. The project will also provide opportunities for high-school students from Delaware and neighboring states to work on magnetism research projects and prepare them for competitions in math, science, and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On Earth, the flow of liquid is mostly controlled by gravity.  In the absence of gravity, capillary forces (surface tension) govern flow.  In space, water in a glass would not remain conformed to the shape of the glass. In space, water?s shape is driven by capillary forces, and would cover all sides of the glass and form a blob over all surfaces.  The absence of gravity also means the absence of buoyancy.  On Earth, a closed bottle of water with some air would have the air on top, but in space, the air bubbles could be anywhere inside the bottle and have any size. This project focuses on molten metallic alloys, which are a liquid useful for brazing and soldering in space for repair of damaged surfaces (due to impact of micrometeoroids and space debris), as well as for construction in space.  Such alloys melt and solidify gradually.  The goal is to control the concurrent melting and capillary flow of a molten alloy in microgravity and predict the resulting microstructure of the bond.  This project is ensuring durable bonding for repair and construction in space man-made habitats and impacting the ability to control other liquids in space and on Earth.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>It is observed that near-eutectic binary alloys, subject to concurrent melting and capillary/gravitational flow, are prone to flow-induced segregation whereupon it solidifies into two very different microstructures. The extent of segregation varies, apparently depending on the processing conditions as well as on the geometry of the capillary flow. This project consists of: (i) a series of experiments performed on the U.S. International Space Station with simultaneous ground-based experiments, and, since the melting/flow solidification process cannot be observed directly ?  (ii) a detailed mesoscale modelling program of the process (phase field computations). The objectives of the project are to: (i) understand the detailed physical mechanisms of segregation during capillary flow under both microgravity and terrestrial conditions. Focus is being afforded to the effects of gravity, temperature gradients, peak temperature, and interaction of diffusion-controlled melting and flow of the melt.

These machines can improve how individuals and small companies make products by increasing the speed and precision of making products while reducing the costs and labor compared to typical ways of manufacturing. The current ability of digital fabrication to support many kinds of manufacturing is limited by how existing equipment performs when run in an automated mode. Designers and manufacturers rely on techniques for making products that are specific to domains and materials.  Their techniques often require combining automatic and manual operations. However, current digital fabrication technologies enforce the same ways of operating regardless of domain or material.  The machine control methods limit operators to setting machine instructions in advance and responding to machine errors. These methods prevent operators from applying their domain knowledge or manual skills in the fabrication process and keep them from using digital fabrication with their existing way of making things. This project aims to enable experts to use digital fabrication technologies in powerful domain-specific workflows. The project will investigate new machine control methods and software design techniques that blend precise automated ways of making products with an expert controlling the machine by hand. This research will create new business opportunities by allowing domain experts to adapt digital manufacturing processes to the making of their products. This project will also help users tailor digital fabrication machines to their specific needs, which will lead to new products and materials, as well as new types of digital fabrication.<br/><br/>This project will establish domain-specific computer-numerical control (CNC) toolpath abstractions, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software interfaces, CNC machine architecture, and collaborative engineering methodologies for building cross-domain digital fabrication technologies for professional practice. Prior research has examined novice-oriented digital fabrication technologies focusing on high-level design specification and entirely automated fabrication practices or separate efforts in interactive digital fabrication interaction. To date, research in digital fabrication lacks a systematic investigation of the relationship between CNC machine mechanisms, control architecture, CAM toolpath design, and operation paradigms that blend automated and manual control. The investigators will conduct a comparative analysis of the practices of contemporary product designers and manufacturers who produce either manually or digitally fabricated products in low volume. The investigators will use insights on the barriers that practitioners from different domains face in the manufacturing workflow to inform the development of CNC control methods that enable creators to safely and efficiently reconfigure CNC machines to build new products. The investigators will pair the development of new CNC engineering techniques with the investigation of CAM design technologies that allow practitioners to precisely control machine behavior, coordinate machining operations with manual intervention, and understand and predict the fabrication workflow. The investigators will integrate their research with an education agenda that spans higher education and secondary public school education aimed at engaging students in computer science and entrepreneurial learning through applying digital fabrication to produce functional products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Non-Technical Summary  <br/><br/>Many technologically relevant fields require increasingly complex materials that pose severe challenges in their preparation and development.  The limitations of current synthetic approaches thus represent a major bottleneck to the extensive tuning of physical properties and for the realization of potential commercial applications.  This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF's Division of Materials Research, addresses the challenges inherent to the preparation of crystalline semiconductors for facilitating the efficient capture of sunlight for the reduction of carbon dioxide.  Results from this work leading to the synthesis of new semiconductors, and, for example, the efficient production of chemical fuels from them, are important to our nation's progress toward clean and renewable energy production.  The discovery of compounds occurring at the limits of synthesizability is aimed at understanding the impacts of new structural features on their properties and stability during the capture and conversion of solar energy, and thus pushing the frontiers of structure-property relationships.  More broadly, the advancement of synthetic approaches to prepare complex semiconductors helps to accelerate their technological development for many related applications in the electronics industry.  The professional training of undergraduate and graduate students is provided within these research activities, such as advanced characterization techniques at national laboratories, with a focus on the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups.  Educational efforts include the development of an undergraduate laboratory module as well as a professional training workshop at North Carolina State University in advanced materials characterization.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2. Technical Summary<br/><br/>Advancing capabilities to attain crystalline solids with technologically useful properties can be bolstered by the development of synthetic approaches to target new compositions and structures that are thermodynamically unstable, or metastable.  The discovery of the underlying factors leading to their kinetic stabilization, including for those compounds not yet predicted computationally, represents a central objective of the research project. Research plans for this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF's Division of Materials Research, specifically focus on the investigation of metastable, Cu(I)-containing semiconductors that have promising applications as p-type semiconductors for the absorption of solar energy and the catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide at their surfaces. Synthetic aspects are aimed at advancing the accessible range of crystalline structures and optimal photoelectrochemical properties through the unlocking of relatively low temperature pathways using flux-mediated reaction conditions.  Structural characterization by X-ray and neutron scattering is used to help answer key questions regarding the mechanistic synthetic transformations and the resulting kinetic stability.  Fundamental insights into the optimal tuning of their crystalline structures and chemical compositions to achieve the efficient reduction of carbon dioxide under sunlight are probed in depth by photoelectrochemical property measurements.  The key relationships to their thermodynamic instability and electronic structures are also established with synergistic computational efforts using density functional theory.  Educational initiatives include professional training for students involved on this project, a new undergraduate laboratory module in solid-state chemistry, and an annual workshop in materials characterization using Rietveld methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these materials are porous, with molecular structures resembling sponges, allowing them to trap molecules. Among them, frameworks are a large class of crystalline porous materials. Engineering the pore shape and chemical composition of a framework controls what molecules can be absorbed and what chemical reactions occur within it. Inspired by the modular architecture of proteins, there is growing interest in making frameworks out of peptides, which are simpler fragments of proteins. However, peptides are still relatively complex molecules and there are many unknowns regarding how to make them self-assemble them into porous materials. This proposal aims to append peptides with flat molecules that are prone to stacking, called aromatic ?-stackers. Aromatic ?-stackers are highly diverse in shape, size, and other properties, and they have well-established assembly rules that could be used to predictably guide the peptide assembly, allowing for more straightforward and rational synthesis of sophisticated peptide frameworks. Specifically, this proposal seeks to uncover the rules that will allow chemists to target peptide framework structure and dynamics through design of the ?-stacker unit. If successful, these porous peptide frameworks can further evolve through mutations of the peptide sequence to meet a broad range of applications improving sustainability and health. In addition, this proposal will develop educational 3-D printed peptide model kits aimed at increasing intuition for complicated protein interactions through the power of touch.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Porous crystalline materials (or ?frameworks?) possess pores or channels that provide 3-D microenvironments for interacting with molecules, making these materials broadly useful in separation and catalytic processes. Most frameworks are composed of inorganic or organic building blocks, but there is significant interest in using bio-derived components to construct pores that better resemble the complex active sites of proteins, as these protein-mimicking frameworks could be well-suited for broadly important applications like stereoselective catalysis, chiral separations, molecular sensing, and drug-delivery. Small peptides are potentially ideal building blocks to achieve this objective since they are simpler fragments of proteins; however, it remains difficult to precisely control peptide assembly. The objective of this proposal is to establish predictable strategies for making porous peptide materials by combining peptides with tailored ?-stacking aromatic groups that drive the assembly and provide added function. This proposal will develop new porous topologies by rationally tuning the ?-stackers, which is expected to also impact framework conformational dynamics upon molecular recognition. Additionally, to better teach the complicated concepts of protein and peptide assembly, 3-D printed molecular puzzles will be developed to engage tactile skills. Tactile manipulation adds to visual learning, providing a multisensory approach to increase intuition for understanding intricate protein interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to vast design freedom, the rapid laser melting during additive manufacturing can produce highly refined structures at the nanoscale in metals for achieving high strength. However, high-strength nanostructured metals often suffer from limited ductility, which is an ability to be stretched without breaking. This strength-ductility tradeoff has been a long-standing challenge in materials science and the quest for materials that can simultaneously enhance strength and ductility has been a long-sought-after goal. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of materials that contain high concentrations of five or more different elements in near equal atomic proportions, in contrast to traditional alloys that are primarily based on one major element with some minor alloying elements added. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental investigations into additive manufacturing of HEAs towards strength-ductility synergy beyond current benchmarks. This project is helping to understand the microstructural origin and deformation mechanism that govern the mechanical properties of 3D-printed HEAs by integrating microstructural characterization, mechanical testing, and computational modeling. The knowledge being established in this project will guide the development of strong yet tough metal alloys for various applications such as advanced energy systems, transportation, and defense. This CAREER award also includes a significant educational component that engages students in research across high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. Through broadening participation of underrepresented groups, this project is diversifying the next generation of researchers and STEM leaders in materials science and advanced manufacturing. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>3D-printed metal alloys usually involve highly localized melting processes, strong temperature gradients, and fast cooling rates. These extreme printing conditions result in far-from-equilibrium states that enable microstructural refinement to the nanoscale for achieving high strength. However, high-strength nanostructured metal alloys often suffer from limited ductility, known as the strength-ductility tradeoff. Through harnessing the extreme printing conditions of laser additive manufacturing and favorable compositional effect of HEAs, a unique type of hierarchical microstructure in the form of dual-phase nanolamellae embedded in microscale eutectic colonies is achieved in 3D-printed eutectic HEAs. This process gives rise to an exceptional combination of strength and ductility. This CAREER award is investigating the fundamental processing-structure-property relationship in these strong yet ductile nanolamellar EHEAs produced by additive manufacturing. The scientific objectives in this study are to: 1) Understand how laser printing protocols affect the solidification microstructure and mechanical properties of 3D-printed eutectic HEAs. Process-sensitive thermal modeling will be developed to unveil the physical link between the complex printing parameters and the solidification microstructure and resulting mechanical properties. 2) Unravel the deformation mechanism and micromechanical response of 3D-printed eutectic HEAs by in situ neutron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. 3) Elucidate the phase transformation pathways in 3D-printed eutectic HEAs upon post-printing heat treatment. A fundamental investigation of the phase transformation pathways and kinetics during annealing of the far-from-equilibrium 3D-printed HEAs are being performed to expand the palette for materials design. The mechanistic insights and design motifs being provided by this CAREER project have broad implications for the development of hierarchical, multi-phase, nanostructured alloys with excellent mechanical properties. This award also encompasses an educational and outreach plan to advance research training and education of next-generation students and underrepresented groups. New outreach initiatives such as 3D printing workshops and a summer-enrichment program will be developed to inspire women and underrepresented minorities and increase the diversity of our future workforce in materials science and advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One pathway toward increasing the performance of solar cells is to increase the portion of sunlight that can be used to generate electricity. Much of the sun?s light is wasted because it consists of low-energy photons which are not absorbed by the semiconductors used to make solar cells. Low energy photons can be made usable by transforming them into higher energy photons through a process called upconversion. For example, two low-energy infrared photons can be converted into a higher-energy visible photon. This project will use a combination of organic molecules known to enable the upconversion process and metal halide perovskites, which are currently being investigated for use in solar cells. The perovskite will be used to absorb the low energy light and excite the organic molecules. Upon successful upconversion, higher energy light can then be absorbed for use in a solar cell. A combination of optical techniques and microscopy will lead to a detailed understanding of the underlying processes. Beyond the scientific impact of this project, a goal is to guide students to further pursue a scientific career and inspire their independent research, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving capabilities by strong mentorship in undergraduate research and education. This activity aims to inspire a new generation of scientists. To close the growing rift between scientists and the non-scientific community, a strong foundation linking the PI?s institution with the local community will be built by outreach lectures and science communication (?Kitchen Chemistry? or ?Kitchen Spectroscopy?) via local TV and social media outlets.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Efficient interconversion of solar energy to chemical or electrical energy is the key to meeting the future energy demands of our society. Improved photon utilization through an upconversion process involving triplet generation at the perovskite/organic semiconductor interface is a very promising approach to increase the photoexcited state lifetime and therefore, overall device efficiencies. The principal investigator will explore perovskite-sensitized solid-state upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation to unravel the role of microscale and nanoscale molecular arrangement in OSCs. A combination of optical spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy will be employed to elucidate the local optoelectronic properties originating from specific molecular arrangements of polyacenes on perovskite substrates. Control over orbital coupling by molecular placement will allow the involved steps to be systematically evaluated. The main goal is to understand why commonly utilized annihilators which exhibit high efficiencies in solution (e.g., diphenylanthracene) do not yield transferable results in the solid state, and how aggregation effects can be harnessed or avoided to improve solid-state upconversion yields. To achieve this goal, new perovskite/triplet acceptor pairs will be developed to investigate why promising solution-based triplet annihilators perform poorly in the solid state. The effect of local intermolecular interactions on the upconversion process will be studied on the microscale and the nanoscale using optical scanning probe microscopy and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The combination of characterization methods spanning from the ensemble to the atomic scale will reveal the local structure-property relationships governing the bulk optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskite/OSC-based TTA upconversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike traditional, theoretical approaches, which assume adversaries act purely rationally, this project incorporates data from human decision-making experiments and surveys to create more realistic and actionable models.

These particles (also called ?particulate organic matter? or POM) carry carbon into the deep ocean where it is stored for hundreds of years. The storage of carbon in the deep ocean contributes to the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as loss of nutrients from the surface ocean. Understanding the mechanisms and processes that govern the fluxes of POM is thus directly relevant to the global carbon cycle, marine ecology, and fisheries. This project uses new tools to measure the isotopes of three different elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen). The approach shows promise for addressing a long-standing question: to what extent do bacteria replace the organic matter from algae (the original source of the POM) as particles sink. Results from this study will be important for predicting the amount and dietary quality of POM in a rapidly changing ocean. The project will support Ph.D. students at both Caltech and University of Miami and educational activities for K-12 and college students. <br/><br/>The project takes advantage of a recent analytical development, the measurement of hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a new tracer. Preliminary measurements suggest that there is a large (up to 20%) shift in the hydrogen isotope ratio of amino acids within POM over the upper 300 m of the ocean, consistent with the depth at which POM degradation is most intense. The investigators hypothesize that the shift in hydrogen isotopes reflects the replacement of phytoplankton biomass with bacterial biomass. The project will test this hypothesis through 1) the analysis of archived POM samples from four different localities in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 2) measurements of diverse phytoplankton grown in culture, and 3) degradation experiments in which algal biomass is fed to bacteria and zooplankton. In addition to cutting-edge hydrogen isotope measurements, the investigators will employ a suite of additional measurements to characterize the microbial communities and POM being studied. Collectively, this work aims to develop hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a novel proxy for the turnover of organic matter within marine particles, which could be applied to studies of marine POM throughout the world?s oceans. The project will also develop outreach activities to introduce K-12 and collegiate students to marine science. These will be implemented through the GO-Outdoors program in Pasadena, the Exploring Marine Science Day in Miami, and undergraduate student cruises in Miami.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large number of receptors located on the plasma membrane of the plant cell sense these stresses.  The goal of this project is to characterize the components and functions of structures called nanodomains located on the membrane of each plant cell.  Nanodomains are specialized regions of the membrane that are highly enriched in saturated lipids and nanodomain-specific proteins.  This project will explore how nanodomains change during plant responses to pathogen infections, using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the economically important crop potato.  The broader impact of this project will support the development of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) that will engage undergraduate students in original research.  In addition, the investigator will provide a trainer workshop to engage K-12 teachers in Mobile County, AL through a strategic partnership with the USA Department of Leadership and Teacher Education.  The integrated scientific and broader impact goals will bring a unique experience both to students participating in the CURE and to Education students/future K-12 teachers.  This project will enhance the recruitment, retention, and professional development of educators and students not only at the University of South Alabama but also in regional public-school systems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to characterize the lipid and protein constituents of the plasma membrane nanodomains in Arabidopsis thaliana and their contributions to plant immunity.  Plant cell plasma membrane is a complex organelle partitioned into heterogenous fractions, allowing for recruitment of specific proteins.  Membrane nanodomains are specialized regions of the plasma membrane that are enriched in ordered lipids (sterols, saturated phospholipids, ceramides, etc.) and they may contribute to responses to biotic interactions in many plant species.  The project will explore the functions of a group of highly conserved nanodomain-occupying proteins called Remorins.  The researchers will use a combination of proteomic, lipidomic, and biochemical approaches to identify shifts in membrane nanodomain components and dynamics upon the activation of plant innate immunity, and how these changes are driven by Remorin family proteins in both Arabidopsis thaliana and potato.

Living creatures use Earth?s predictable, 24-hr light:dark cycle to organize and optimize biological processes. While this has been beneficial for millions of years, the modern use of artificial light at night, which includes environmental light pollution and night shiftwork, hijacks light-sensing mechanisms and disrupts biological processes. Recently, light has been found to affect one of the most shared and essential biological processes ? breathing. This project will advance the understanding of how light affects fundamental biology by defining the neurobiological pathways used by light to affect breathing. Integrated into the research program, this project emphasizes the education and training of undergraduate students in creative problem-solving skills. These skills are expected to foster the next generation of STEM innovators to promote scientific discovery in an ever-changing world.<br/><br/>Defining the neurobiological circuits that mediate light?s effects on breathing can better equip society to predict and respond to the physiological effects of light pollution. The goal of this project is to identify the retinal and brain pathways used by light to modulate breathing and blood gas homeostasis. This project uses whole-body plethysmography and a combination of chemogenic and viral approaches in transgenic mice to: 1) Determine the neuronal populations by which intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) modulate breathing rate and minute ventilation, and 2) Determine the extent to which ipRGC projections to the hypothalamic biological clock organize the respiratory chemoreflex to the light:dark cycle. This contribution is significant because it critically expands the current understanding of breathing behavior to include light as a fundamentally important, ubiquitous, and previously undocumented modulator of breathing. Overall, this project is expected to positively impact several research fields, including basic and clinical respiratory physiology, circadian biology, neuroscience, and ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, radiocarbon, which decays over thousands of years, can be used to determine that ocean currents travel from the surface to the deep sea in about 300 to 1000 years, depending on where you are.  Radiocarbon decay is too slow for this technique to be used in the upper ocean.  Beryllium-7 is another radioactive element generated in the atmosphere.  Beryllium-7 decays in months so it is well suited to the faster circulation of the upper ocean.  Unfortunately, beryllium-7 is very rare, so measurements are expensive.  In this project an affordable and efficient system will be designed and built to sample beryllium-7 in seawater.  The system will be tested near Florida and then used near Bermuda to estimate how quickly the upper ocean circulates.  The circulation timescales will be used with oxygen measurements to estimate the rate of biological activity in this part of the Atlantic Ocean.<br/><br/>The project will develop an in situ pumping system to more easily collect beryllium-7 from seawater.  The prototype will be tested on a brief cruise near Florida and then deployed as part of Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) cruises over four seasons and two years.  To estimate lateral trends in preformed oxygen and in beryllium-7, additional sampling near the BATS site is planned on all cruises.  The beryllium-7 data collected at BATS will be applied in an established vertical mixing model to estimate vertical diffusivities (Kz) and Oxygen Utilization Rates (OURs) over a full seasonal cycle.  The lateral beryllium-7 and oxygen trends measured will be used to calculate the impacts of horizontal transport on the vertical model.  The Kz and OUR estimates will be compared with those determined at BATS in 2007/8 using the older, large volume sampling technique for beryllium-7.  The sampling system has promising applications to other trace elements and isotopes and will provide for more widespread applications of beryllium-7.

The Q-ICPMS makes it possible to measure most of the elements in the periodic table with great sensitivity (below parts per trillion detection limits) in minutes. The LAM is a front-end sampler that allows measurement of solid materials in spots as small as 5 microns. Twenty-one separate research groups have developed new applications with the proposed instrumentation, including projects that bear on volcanic hazards, geohealth, and critical minerals.

The primary research to utilize the LAM-Q-ICPMS system is focused on measuring chemical zonation in volcanic crystals for developing diffusion timescales of magma in motion beneath active volcanoes, and on measuring boron isotopes in serpentinites to trace the deep earth water cycle at subduction zones. Others in the user group propose provenance studies that focus on paleoclimate or human artifacts; in situ trace element analyses of melt inclusions, tephra and crystals for volcanic-magmatic-ore deposit research; corals and foraminifera for paleo-climate reconstructions; geohealth applications in the study of trace metals in rice, hair, soil and paint; and environmental engineering applications in carbon sequestration and processing of ores. In addition to LDEO and the AMNH, the new instrumentation will support research at other institutions in the New York City area, including several CUNY campuses and Stockton University.

Stiff arteries affect up to 20 million people over the age of 60. The solution is a medical device that is implanted through minimally invasive procedures, serving the patients who are not responsive to medication. The treatment population can benefit from a higher quality of life and a lower risk of complications including stroke, heart failure, heart attack, kidney failure, and vision loss. In addition to increased patient health, this solution can result in a reduction of expensive surgeries associated with cardiovascular diseases and strokes. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of a physical approach to reduce systolic blood pressure. Within a pulse of blood from the heart, energy is usually distributed through the arteries due to their compliance. However, as people age, the arteries stiffen, leading to reduced buffering of this pulse wave and ultimately to isolated systolic hypertension. This disease is difficult to adapt to, since it stems from a physical change in the molecules that make up the walls of the blood vessels. The solution restores the native compliance of the blood vessels using an implantable device, which then brings the patient's blood pressure back to a healthy state. This solution differs from current treatments by directly treating stiff arteries, which are one of the most critical risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ubiquity of this concept is central to its connection with dynamics, the study of systems that evolve in time and space. These processes can be either deterministic, as in the movement of planets, or stochastic, as in the throwing of dice. The main purpose of this proposal is to study the interplay between dynamics and groups (group actions and dynamics) using the methods of logic, with a particular emphasis on the tools of descriptive set theory. Descriptive set theory precisely studies how complicated it is to define certain subsets, equivalences, and related objects. In particular, it can show whether certain simple classifications of objects exist or are impossible.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will focus on understanding the complexity of random walks and their Poisson Boundaries, the possible symmetries and joinings of dynamical systems, and the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Poisson Boundaries capture the notion of asymptotic indistinguishability for random walks. They also classify the space of an important set of functions on groups (the bounded harmonic functions). When the boundary is trivial, this implies that in the long term all random walks look similar. One goal of this project is to make progress in understanding when this triviality occurs. Joinings represent a broad notion of symmetry, more general than morphisms or factor maps, that topological dynamical systems can have. Understanding the joinings of a topological dynamical system to itself provides a rich perspective on the various symmetries that the system can possess. Borel equivalence relations are a formal way to precisely describe whether classification problems are easy or difficult. This project aims to further impact their study, as well as to initiate the exploration of linear algebraic analogues of Borel equivalence relations.

The LA metropolitan area sits above a deep sedimentary basin that significantly affects the level of ground shaking from local and regional earthquakes. The basin has a complex tectonic history of extension and compression and is also crosscut by numerous faults. This has resulted in a complicated subsurface structure that leads to significant variation in site amplification of seismic waves across the basin, as evidenced by the recorded ground shaking following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake. In the summer of 2022, a temporary 300-node geophone array was deployed across the entire LA basin, providing a seismic data set with uniform and dense coverage for the first time. In this project, the researchers will analyze these data and combine them with other available seismic and gravity observations in the region to construct a detailed 3D basin model. The model will help explain the level of amplification in different areas of the basin as well as its lateral variations The resulting model may be used to model ground motion for realistic earthquake scenarios, which is vital for evaluating infrastructure preparedness.  In addition, this project will explore the connection between the resulting seismic velocity model with mapped geological features, and the tectonic evolution of the LA Basin. Through the research, the project will support graduate and postdoctoral education, and the scientific findings will contribute to seismic hazard assessment efforts in southern California.<br/><br/>The density of the 300 sensor LA nodal array deployed in 2022 will enable the use of novel passive seismic imaging methods. By extracting Rayleigh and Love surface waves from multi-component ambient noise correlations, it will be possible to measure their velocity dispersion and Rayleigh wave ellipticity in the region. Techniques based on particle motion and apparent slowness will be developed to isolate different modes of surface waves. Both isotropic as well as radially and azimuthally anisotropic basin structures will be investigated using surface wave measurements. By using receiver function and autocorrelation methods, in addition to surface wave properties, it will be possible to determine crustal discontinuities, including major intra-basin sedimentary interfaces, the bottom of the basin, and the shape of the Moho beneath it. The use of gravity data will guide the identification of converted and reflected phases and determine the tectonic extension that the basin has experienced, enabling evaluation of the extent of thermal subsidence that has occurred within it. The dataset that will be analyzed is unique in an academic setting for its density, regularity, and completeness of coverage, allowing for the exploration of new methodologies. These include mapping shallow seismicity to identify possible unknown faults, using reflected surface waves to map the properties of faults within the basin as well as discover new ones, and determining aspects of the stress field through anisotropy. The 3D basin model constructed in this project is expected to be more accurate than the current community velocity models (CVMs), enabling more reliable ground motion predictions for various earthquake rupture scenarios. The new model will be validated through simulations of recent earthquakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Food?s energy, however, is only made available for the body?s metabolic functions through intestinal absorption, which is impacted by both environmental and evolutionary factors. For example, children living in adverse and unsanitary conditions often have damaged intestines and poor intestinal energy absorption, which negatively affects their growth, development, and lifelong metabolic health. Impaired intestinal absorption leads to increased energy loss through urine and feces. This loss causes higher food energy demands, that may not be attainable under adverse conditions. Despite its importance, research and data on intestine function variation and its impact on children?s health and growth is limited. To address this issue, this doctoral dissertation research project investigates differences in children?s energy absorption among those living in adverse and unsanitary conditions in both rural and peri-urban contexts. Results are shared broadly, and outreach activities are directed to K-12 children.  <br/><br/>This research advances understanding of the role of intestinal absorption in driving variation in human phenotype and health by investigating intestinal function among children living in rural and peri-urban contexts. Data collection in both contexts capture a wide range of variation in experienced diet, lifestyle, sanitation, and pathogen exposure. There are two main research questions: (1) How do household conditions relate to children?s intestinal function and energy loss? And (2) How do intestinal function and energy loss impact children?s body size and nutritional status? By measuring fecal energy loss using the 'bomb' calorimetry approach, this research has the potential to better characterize global variation in intestinal energy absorption and to improve the accuracy of estimates of children?s energy requirements. These improved estimates will refine life history models of human evolution and could inform more effective nutritional interventions for children in similar contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Imaging in the MIR range of the spectrum is attractive because it produces images with molecular-specific contrast. State-of-the-art MIR cameras, however, lack the performance and speed needed to tackle numerous imaging challenges. A new MIR detection approach, based on non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) in the detector chip, promises to overcome such shortcomings by enabling MIR mapping with prototypical silicon-based detectors. This program significantly advances the MIR sensitivity and detection speed of silicon-based cameras by modifying the detector surface such that the NTA process is dramatically enhanced. These modified surfaces, called metasurfaces, consist of micrometer-sized structures that concentrate the incoming light and boost the affinity for two-photon absorption in silicon. The advances made in this project render silicon-based cameras ripe for fast imaging applications in the MIR, offering high-definition visualization not possible with existing MIR cameras. The project further supports extensive training for graduate and undergraduate students, equipping them with advanced skills in the areas of physical chemistry, optical microscopy, and molecular biophysics - skills essential for the support of cutting-edge science and technology in society. Finally, by offering students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) an exciting and immersive summer research experience, this project promotes diversity by increasing the number of African American doctoral students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>Technical description of the project:<br/>MIR imaging allows the visualization of objects with chemical contrast. Imaging technologies based on MIR light are important in a myriad of fields, including the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries, forensics, art conservation, biomedical imaging, and more. There are, however, several technological hurdles that have held back a broader implementation of the MIR imaging approach, and chief among these is the limited performance of MIR cameras. Compared to technologically mature Si-based cameras optimized for the visible and near-infrared (NIR) range of the spectrum, MIR cameras offer limited pixel density and acquisition speed, and suffer from issues related to thermal noise. Several recent developments seek to overcome these limitations by employing frequency conversion strategies that allow MIR detection with Si-based cameras instead. Among these developments, NTA-based MIR detection is particularly attractive, as it offers robust mid-infrared imaging capabilities at frame rates exceeding 1 kHz. In this project, we advance NTA-enabled MIR imaging by developing silicon detectors optimized for NTA detection. So far, the NTA approach has relied on conventional Si photodetectors that are designed for one-photon absorption for light detection. Here, we design metasurfaces that dramatically improve the two-photon absorption process in silicon, giving rise to a boost in the NTA detection efficiency by at least one order of magnitude. By precisely sculpting the sensor surface with micrometer-sized silicon structures and following a systematic optimization approach that leverages the state-of-the-art in metasurface design, we will produce the first silicon-based detector specifically optimized for light detection in the MIR wavelength range.  The MIR detection sensitivities achieved in this work render NTA detection a practical and robust solution for MIR imaging applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there is a need to reduce leakage when part of an intestine is surgically removed, and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). Resultant infections may produce complications that may be life-threatening, costly, and detrimental to patient outcomes. The technology is a bioresorbable 3D-printable tube and compressive band combination. The 3D printing allows for a printed, customized surgical solution to accommodate individual anatomical variations. With widespread adoption, this technology has the potential to set a new standard for GI surgical care, improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs. In addition, this advance may lead to applications that address leakage in other tubular organs and may inspire the development of new bioresorbable medical devices.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a bioresorbable stent and compressive band combination to improve the safety of gastrointestinal (GI) anastomoses. The goal of the technology is to prevent anastomotic leakage and its resultant infectious complications. The collapsible, low-profile device design allows for introduction and delivery through laparoscopic ports for use in minimally invasive procedures. After implantation, the components are resorbed by the body by which time the risk of leakage has passed, eliminating the need for follow-up procedures to remove the device. The expandable, low-profile design can be used in minimally invasive procedures. Benchtop testing has demonstrated the device?s ability to create anastomoses with minimized leakage risk. This device may address the current limitations of existing methods such as staples and sutures and improve patient GI surgery outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given present day situations as a consequence of population movement as a result of war and violence, archaeology can help to understand how such populations negotiate aspects of their lives through material culture over multiple centuries. Archaeological ceramic analysis is well suited to study this phenomenon because it can yield information on how communities? choices in production, consumption, and use changed or stayed the same before and after cultural contact events. These choices often reflect social and economic affiliations of group members. Data from this project offers insights into how human populations adapt to social change, providing valuable perspectives for contemporary issues of migration and cultural integration. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence showing societies have a wide range of responses to both external stimuli and internal negotiations. The project produces new knowledge on adaptations to growing issues of culture contact experienced today and provides information to partners on ancestral practices and land use. The researchers are working with community organizations to integrate analytical perspectives, give local presentations and museum exhibits, and improve public understanding of archaeological science and the scientific method.  <br/><br/>The research examines how choices in ceramic production, consumption, and use were mediated when inhabitants interacted with a very early city site.

This project integrates chemical data collected via neutron activation analysis (NAA) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) as well as mineralogical data collected from ceramic petrography.

The synthesis of new ribosomes (which make proteins) plays a crucial role in supporting the increased protein synthesis required during the cell cycle and division to make new cells.  However, the role of the synthesis of new ribosomes in cells that are fully matured and incapable of cell division remains much less clear.  Mature skeletal muscle cells are differentiated cells, meaning that they cannot undergo cell division anymore; yet several proteins typically associated with the cell cycle are expressed in skeletal muscle cells, even though they will never divide.  This research project  will investigate the roles of proteins responsible for cell cycle progression in non-dividing cells, such as mature muscle cells, in particular the synthesis of new ribosomes.  Using novel genetically modified mouse models, the researchers will manipulate the cell cycle to explore the effects slowing or speeding up the cell cycle on ribosome production and muscle cell size.  Undergraduate students working from the Principal Investigator?s lab, and from a new Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE), will receive extensive training on muscle biology while supporting this project.<br/><br/>While cell cycle progression has been extensively studied in proliferative cells, the role of cell cycle regulators in postmitotic cells remains unclear.  Fully differentiated skeletal muscle cells can express several cell cycle regulators that are key to ribosome biogenesis ? a cellular process where we hypothesize that the role of these regulators is conserved in postmitotic cells. This research aims to investigate the role of cell cycle regulators in mature skeletal muscle cells, focusing primarily at the level of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4), a central kinase regulating ribosome biogenesis in proliferative cells.  Specifically, this study will:  1) Determine whether CDK4 regulates muscle ribosome biogenesis and muscle cell size, and; 2) Test whether promoting cell cycle progression via a constitutively active CDK4 in differentiated muscle cells causes the muscle progenitor cells, known as satellite cells, to fuse with the mature myofibers. To address these questions, the PI, graduate, and undergraduate researchers will use genetically modified mouse models to specifically and conditionally knock out or overexpress key regulators of the cell cycle, such as CDK4, in mature myonuclei.  If the hypothesis is correct, the results from this proposal will represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the role of cell cycle in terminally differentiated cells, such as muscle cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Membrane assembly is a spontaneous event driven by the simple fact that oil and water do not mix. This project seeks to understand how membrane encapsulated vesicles (protocells) might have formed and reproduced in the absence of any genetic information. The project investigates how molecules that are amphiphilic (simultaneously polar and non-polar) assemble into vesicle compartments, and how these compartments might drive the formation of additional membrane building blocks. This project tackles whether information can be carried over across generations of vesicles, with offspring adapting to their environment over time. If true, this will demonstrate the feasibility of a form of Darwinian evolution on a system that does not (yet) contain genes. A Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience Astrobiology course where students design a space exploration mission will be expanded. The course is designed to develop a teamwork ethos, critical thinking, data analysis, and public presentation skills. The novelty of the type of laboratory work involved would provide students the opportunity to develop a unique skill set in microfluidics. <br/><br/>This project has three main scientific goals: (i) use catalytic minerals to promote the synthesis and polymerization of organosulfur species to yield amphiphilic molecules. (ii) Probe the capability of such amphiphiles to self-assemble into vesicle compartments and develop a robust methodology for studying their individual and population-wide composition. And (iii) assess if such vesicles display generational heredity ? allowing for a primitive form of evolution by natural selection. Selection pressures, such as changes in temperature and pH, will be applied to determine if the naturally-selected composition of older generations biases that of future ones. Custom-made microfluidic setups will be incorporated to enable the control and manipulation of fluids constrained to the microliter scale, where surface forces prevail over volumetric ones, and allow for the simulation of the out-of-equilibrium conditions naturally found in energy-rich geochemical settings.

This multifaceted project examines the ways that the distributions of parasites and their hosts align with the geographical distribution of extreme hydrological events. Concurrently, the researchers examine heterogeneity in human communities that may be associated with the risk of parasitic infections during floods. By combining these data sources, the researchers advance a general conceptual model for the transmission of parasitic infections. Key findings are shared with local community partners, and the project contributes to the education and training of an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>This project considers human variability to parasitic infections in response to both environmental factors, especially hydrological events, and variation in human populations. Adopting a biogeographical approach, the researchers examine the distribution of vector species over time while concurrently leveraging machine learning methods to identify the considerations that underlie vulnerability. As a complement to the quantitative modeling, the researchers employ focus groups to substantiate the mechanisms that underlie disease transmission and potential remedies.

The chemicals produced could be a fuel like hydrogen, or they could be other desirable products with other commercial uses. Usually, the energy from sunlight is collected using photovoltaic solar cells made from silicon that generate electrical energy. These solar cells are typically seen on rooftops. However, these systems are not currently used to produce chemicals because it is not cost-effective. This project uses the same semiconductor material silicon to make millions of microscopic particles that each behave as a miniature solar cell. The project will design the particles to produce high voltages that make them capable of doing chemistry. Unlike a panel on a rooftop, these particles can simply be suspended in water to do the chemistry, providing a new method to perform photoelectrochemistry. The project will develop the fundamental principles to make the particles, stabilize them in water, and make them perform chemistry efficiently. It will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will gain experience in nanomaterials synthesis, microfabrication, electrochemistry, solid-state catalysis, optical measurements, and optoelectronic modeling. A broad set of outreach efforts will be pursued, including programs and demonstrations in elementary schools and local libraries and an annual public science exposition. <br/><br/>Multijunction Si nanowire photocatalysts blur the distinction between, on the one hand, a photovoltaic structure connected to an electrolyzer, and on the other, a semiconductor photoelectrode performing catalysis. The structures are created by a bottom-up vapor-liquid-solid growth process that permits the synthesis of a precise multijunction structure containing both p-i-n solar cells and n-p tunnel junctions in a high aspect ratio particulate form factor hundreds of nanometers in diameters and microns in length. They offer unique advantages for particle suspension reactors, including (1) usage of earth-abundant and non-toxic Si, (2) broadband light absorption into the near infrared, (3) photovoltage tunable for specific reaction chemistry by number of p-i-n junctions, and (4) spatial separation of anodic and cathodic reactions due to the high aspect ratio and axial orientation of the photovoltaic structure. Because the nanostructures uniquely contain both photovoltaic and photoelectrode elements, numerous fundamental scientific questions arise about the single-particle properties, ensemble interactions, and co-catalyst functionality. Thus, the overarching goals of this project are to understand (1) the chemical effects of liquid solution on individual nanowire photovoltaic and photocatalyst properties, (2) the electrochemical and photonic interactions of nanowires in suspension, and (3) co-catalyst design principles that enable well-controlled and efficient photoelectrochemical reactions. The project combines measurements on single nanowires and ensembles of nanowires in suspension with simulation and modeling efforts to predict and interpret their properties. The project will provide fundamental insights into the operation of particle suspension reactors that are applicable not just to Si nanowires but also to a range of photocatalyst material systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the sources and sinks of organic matter associated with this pool of carbon are not well-understood. This project will investigate organic carbon cycling processes that occur as seawater flows through oceanic crust at low temperatures. A large volume of seawater flows through cool ocean crust as it ages, but these sites are not well-studied. Unlike hydrothermal vent fluids, low temperature seeps are difficult to identify because the temperature and chemistry of bottom seawater and cool crustal fluids are more similar. This makes it difficult to find these sites at the seafloor, leaving them largely unexplored. This study will measure the concentration and composition of dissolved organic matter in fluids from two newly discovered sites where low-temperature fluids discharge from seamounts.  In addition, the research will provide new tools for organic matter characterization. As a result, this project will illuminate a part of the oceanic carbon cycle that has often been overlooked. This project also aims to inspire an interest in chemistry and biology among K-12 students by bringing the deep ocean to them. Teachers will develop classroom materials that introduce students to the charismatic octopus families that are attracted to sites of natural fluid discharge, and the fluid chemistry that shapes their behavior, during professional development workshops. The project will also engage students from primarily undergraduate institutions in deep-ocean research. Undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Delaware will also be involved in the project.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of this 5-year project are to: (1) expand the view of cool, aging crust from one study site (North Pond IODP (International Ocean Discovery Program) Site) to three by following the lead of brooding octopus mothers which have recently been found clustered around sites of moderately warm natural discharge from the Dorado and Davidson Seamounts; (2) broaden the analytical window for dissolved organic matter characterization to better identify signatures of microbial activity; and (3) refine the present global estimate of organic carbon loss from the deep ocean by crustal processes. In addition, societal benefits of the project include educational and learning activities for students from the K-12 to the graduate level that are well-integrated with the research. The project will provide training for one graduate student and more than 10 undergraduate students, half of which will come from primarily undergraduate institutions. This project also includes workshops for 30 STEM teachers over 3 years emphasizing hands-on activities that will bring environmental chemistry lessons aligned with Next Generation Science Standards into K-12 classrooms in the State of Delaware.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With sea levels projected to rise 10-12 inches by 2050 along the U.S. coasts, barriers to prevent flooding are needed. Currently proposed methods rely on building extensive infrastructure both above and below land or moving residents to higher elevations, all of which are intrusive to the day-to-day lives of Americans. This project aims to prevent flooding in communities built on limestone soil by modifying the permeability of limestone using naturally occurring bacteria. Reducing the permeability of limestone will prevent underground water from rising into communities. The approach is less invasive than existing technologies, does not require excessive excavation, and may allow citizens to remain in their homes despite the sea level rise. It addresses NSF?s mission to ensure the prosperity of the average American citizen. It also involves stakeholders across multiple industries, including industrial microbiology, geochemistry, and construction, and can be applied to large areas of the US, thus potentially creating jobs and tax revenues from many sources. <br/><br/><br/>Microbially-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP), a process that uses naturally occurring bacteria to create calcium carbonate crystals on surfaces, will be employed to reduce the permeability of limestone to water. Upon optimizing and scaling this process, MICP will be used to modify in-ground limestone structures to reduce flooding in coastal communities. With this long-term goal in mind, and within the scope of an SBIR Phase I project, the goals of this proposal are to optimize the growth and MICP capabilities of naturally occurring bacterial strains in conditions that mimic the underground limestone environment and to test the structure, strength, and permeability of the MICP-modified limestone. The above will be accomplished using a suite of microbial growth and urease assays, biochemical and microscopy assessments of calcium carbonate deposits, and physio-chemical assessment of limestone porosity and bond strength. Together, the work proposed will establish the preferred conditions for MICP on limestone in environmentally relevant experimental conditions. This represents the first critical step towards using MICP in coastal communities to reduce or eliminate groundwater flooding as sea level waters rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are the most numerous life-forms on the planet. In general, bacteriophages consist of a genome made either of DNA or RNA that is packaged into a protective protein shell called a capsid. While much is known about bacteriophages with DNA genomes, far less is understood about those with RNA genomes. This project will investigate how these RNA genomes are packaged into their protein capsids. In particular, the project will describe the shapes into which the RNA genomes are folded, and how these shapes are recognized by the proteins and selected for packaging. By identifying these structures, the project will inform the design of synthetic capsids capable of packaging synthetic RNA molecules for use in RNA-based technologies. Furthermore, these RNA structures will facilitate the discovery of new RNA viruses by learning how to recognize viral RNA in the sequence libraries obtained directly from the environment. These discoveries will advance the understanding of RNA bacteriophage diversity and enable the production of novel nanoscale materials derived from their coat proteins. Throughout, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students in challenging fields of physical chemistry, biochemistry, and computational biology.<br/><br/>Bacteriophage MS2 is the canonical model system for studying viral RNA packaging, yet the mechanisms by which MS2 coat proteins selectively package their RNA genomes while excluding abundant cellular RNA remain unclear. While RNA of a model phage MS2 is believed to contain structural signals that are recognized by its coat proteins during packaging, the precise nature of these signals and their role in selective packaging is not fully understood. This project will use quantitative packaging experiments inside the cells to identify key RNA structures involved in selectivity. Plasmid-encoded RNA molecules with defined structures will compete with the cellular transcriptome for packaging by MS2 coat proteins. Single-particle imaging and high-throughput sequencing will quantify the packaged RNA composition, providing a direct measure of selectivity. These measurements will be used to critically evaluate current hypotheses of selective packaging and identify the key RNA structures involved. The project will then use these structures to screen metagenomic datasets for previously undescribed RNA bacteriophage genomes. Once discovered, the coat proteins from newly identified bacteriophages will be expressed in cells to produce protein capsids. In addition to verifying the discovered bacteriophages, these capsids will provide the research community with new protein nanoparticles for applications in biotechnology and nanoscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike most early learned nouns and verbs, logical words such as ?no? and ?not? cannot be learned by observation because they do not refer to anything children can see or experience directly. Yet, the word ?no? is one of the first words most children say. However, how children learn this word and other words like it is not well understood. Discovering the answer to this question would reveal both the basic mechanisms by which children learn abstract words generally, as well as the childhood origins of the most foundational elements of critical thinking, reasoning, and logic. The broader impacts of this project include teaching and training in developmental and languages sciences for graduate and undergraduate students, and sharing of new language corpus resources created through this project with the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>This project aims to disentangle the difficulty of learning the concept of negation from learning the word (or words) that express the concept. Towards this goal, the project studies how infants and toddlers learn words for negation in English in comparison to other languages. These languages span a spectrum of how many different words are used to express related meanings such as rejection, prohibition, and absence. For example, English expresses these meanings with ?no?, whereas other languages use a different word for each of these meanings. This project tests the hypothesis that infants can grasp the concept of negation early in life, but the ease with which they can learn to express it depends on how many different, closely related words exist in the language they are learning by using language corpora and behavioral testing studies with infants and toddlers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through these outreach and training initiatives, this project will contribute to the development of a well-equipped STEM workforce in the United States, fostering the next generation of scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>This research examines the nanoscale organization of the peptide loading complex (PLC) within the ER, focusing on its structural relationship with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1/2). The complex plays a critical role in assembling major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, which are essential for immune recognition. The project aims to determine how ER morphology influences the function of the complex, thereby providing insight into the broader role of ER architecture in cellular processes. By employing advanced super-resolution microscopy techniques such as DNA-PAINT and 4Pi-SMS, the study will map the spatial distribution of PLC clusters and quantify their size and stoichiometry. Additionally, the research will explore how modulating the PLC?s supramolecular organization affects its function, shedding light on the structural determinants of its activity. This investigation will combine expertise in biochemistry, structural biology, and high-resolution imaging, drawing on the collaborative strengths of the Tamp lab (Frankfurt) and the Bewersdorf lab (Yale). By systematically integrating these methodologies, the project aims to build a comprehensive model of how ER nanomorphology supports cellular processes essential to immune function. The insights gained from this study will not only deepen our understanding of antigen presentation but also contribute to the broader field of ER research by elucidating how macromolecular assemblies are spatially regulated within cellular compartments.  <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Germany project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the German Deutsche Forschung Gemeinschaft (DFG) where NSF funds the US investigator and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New approaches in urban management and community planning are needed to protect life and infrastructure in areas burdened by increased amounts of heavy snow and rain on snow. In Anchorage, rapidly changing snow characteristics in recent years has led to severe property and infrastructure damage. In 2023 and 2024, 24 buildings collapsed under the weight of snow, resulting in one fatality. Most snow monitoring stations are located in nearby mountains and not in urban-population centers. Warnings to clear snow from urban homes and businesses are based on data from these stations despite them being located outside the city. This can lead to difficulties issuing public safety warnings as data may not align with local conditions. Evidence-based information will inform businesses and residents on when and how to safely remove snow. Educational efforts will advance STEM knowledge, ensuring awareness of snow science and load-hazard management. Project outcomes will provide management strategies to improve community planning and prevent building collapse. The findings can be applied to other Alaskan urban areas, such as Fairbanks and Juneau, as well as to other geographical areas facing similar challenges.<br/><br/>The researchers will work with community partners in Anchorage, Alaska, to improve snow- modeling capabilities using an enhanced version of the atmosphere-urban-land-surface model WRF-Urban. The team will better quantify the link between ground-based observations of snowpack properties and snow loads on municipal Anchorage rooftops. This will help create a more sophisticated snow-characteristic model that will improve management and mitigation strategies by improving urban hazard warnings. This project will help build the STEM workforce by engaging high school students to measure the properties of snowpacks related to rooftop snow loads. During the course of this project the research team will develop partnerships to bring this approach to other areas affected by similar events and risks to improve heavy snow hazard mitigation across the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will help physicians to utilize the best antibiotic at the optimal dosage sooner, reducing the number of exposures for antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  Such infections are responsible for more than 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually in the U.S. The integration of the proposed platform with mobile devices for result interpretation ensures that it can be widely deployed, including in resource-limited settings and during emergencies. This adoptability is crucial for promptly responding to future pandemics and ensuring that even remote or underserved areas have access to advanced diagnostic capabilities. This project will help to reduce the economic burden associated with AMR ($20 billion/year) and infectious diseases ($41 billion/year). Once commercialized, the proposed platform is expected to promote better antibiotic stewardship, reducing antibiotic release into the environment. Antibiotics in plants and the food chain pose risks to human and animal health, and contribute to the spread of resistant bacteria, making infections harder to treat and increasing outbreak risk.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel microfluidic platform for rapid and precise AST. Current methods, such as broth microdilution and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion, are limited by long turnaround times of 3-5 days. This delay leads to a postponement in adjusting antibiotics. Even emerging rapid diagnostic systems, while quicker, still require >20 hours to provide results, resulting in >4 doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics before precision adjustments can be made. The proposed platform generates actionable results within 6-9 hours from time of sample, as opposed to the conventional 3-5 days, identifying not only the most efficacious drug but also the appropriate dose. In the short-term, the technology will improve patient outcomes, particularly in life-threatening conditions like sepsis. In the long-term, more precise antibiotic usage promotes stewardship and extends the overall value we can derive from antibiotics before resistance mechanisms become ubiquitous. Three primary areas of risk will be addressed during this project: 1. Compatibility with scalable manufacturing materials used in injection molding, 2. Extending the shelf life to >6 months by lyophilizing pre-loaded antibiotics, and 3. Creating colorimetric interpretation software that can run on mobile devices to provide accessible and objective analysis and readouts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The novel interface integrates robot sensor readings and high-speed predictive simulations of hydrodynamic forces to create an immersive mixed reality (MR) display. In addition to augmented video images of the robot's surroundings, the interface converts measurements of water flow rates, hydrostatic pressure, ambient temperature, and other variables into tactile sensations for the operator. Likewise, the interface will render natural movements of the operator's body into control commands to the robot. The goal is human-robot ""sensory transfer,"" that is, seamless translation of perceptions and actions between the operator and the robot. The goal of this project is to develop and match the capabilities of the interface to industry and worker needs. One anticipated benefit is to reduce the extensive training currently required for operators, thereby increasing access to these jobs while reducing industry training expenses and downtime due to personnel shortages. The project will study the most effective way to improve worker performance, safety, and quality of life, and by requiring a diverse set of subjects, will show how such human-robot interfaces can expand economic opportunity to broad sections of society. The interface can also be used in a purely virtual mode as a training tool. The project will examine the use of this capability to recruit workers from adjacent fields, such as construction. Offshore applications that would directly benefit from this project include subsea infrastructure inspection, geological surveys, marine habitat monitoring, pollution assessments, ship-hull inspections, unexploded ordnance surveys, contraband detection, aquaculture monitoring, search and rescue, and archaeological exploration and surveys. An increase in extreme weather and rising sea levels will place increasing demands on offshore operations to protect and repair coastal damage. Similarly offshore sustainable energy infrastructure such as wind, wave, or tidal generators will increase the demand for undersea inspection, construction, and maintenance.<br/><br/>This project will reconceptualize future subsea industry by advancing knowledge of underwater Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in under-explored subsea workplaces, illuminating socioeconomic features and adult-learning needs of workforce transformation to subsea industry, and establishing academia-industry-government partnerships for improving performance, safety, and societal outcomes of subsea works. Novel human-robot sensory transfer methods are suggested for reliability against conditions unique to subsea. These methods will support fast and accurate reconstruction of subsea workplaces. MR will be used to generate human-perceivable simulation of remote subsea workplaces in real time based on feedback from a novel robotic sensing and data transmission system. Motion capture will be created for easier navigation of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).

However, trace amounts of sulfur exist as dissolved organic sulfur (DOS). Research on DOS in the ocean began in the 2000?s. This is because it is difficult to measure DOS concentration in a solution having almost one million times more inorganic sulfate. While relatively small in quantity compared to inorganic sulfur, DOS plays critical roles in oceanic and atmospheric processes. For example, sunlight degrades DOS into carbonyl sulfide gas, which moves into the upper atmosphere, forming sulfate particles that block sunlight reaching the Earth. Many DOS compounds are essential for microbial growth in the ocean. Additionally, some DOS compounds react with essential (e.g., zinc) and toxic (e.g., mercury) trace metals to affect their solubility and biological availability. To uncover the mysteries of DOS, this study will utilize archived samples collected from over 100 locations in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Antarctica and collect fresh samples in the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. The scientists will measure the total concentrations of DOS in these samples and determine the compounds that make up DOS. Graduate and undergraduate education is a central part of this project. The project will support one graduate student at Old Dominion University and graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. The scientists will share their research with the public through already scheduled lectures and forums. They will also develop and use a virtual reality (VR) experience to simulate what it is like to go to sea and collect samples for DOS.<br/><br/>This research project will uncover the processes governing the marine DOS cycle in the Pacific Ocean, with three primary objectives: 1) Accurately quantify the DOS inventory across the entire Pacific Ocean to clarify its role in the global sulfur cycle. 2) Identify the abiotic and biotic processes responsible for DOS production and removal along two meridional Pacific transects, encompassing different biogeochemical regimes, hydrothermal plumes, and oxygen minimum zones. 3) Conduct a year-long, monthly collection of depth profiles at the Bermuda-Atlantic Time Series (BATS) to investigate the reactivity of DOS and its components. The research will leverage archived samples from three Pacific meridional transects, spanning from Alaska to Antarctica and Antarctica to Mexico, along with newly collected samples from the monthly BATS cruises.

For example, fruit flies rely on cues such as vertical stripes and polarized light to determine which direction to move. Yet, these visual features may represent only a fraction of those necessary for navigation. The main goal of this project is to understand the detailed network dynamics underlying visual processing and identify important visual features for navigation by combining anatomical, physiological, and computational approaches. The study will represent a significant step toward mechanistically describing the dynamics of an entire neural circuit, from sensory processing to developing spatial and directional senses??abstract cognitive entities. In addition, the proposed studies can inspire broader fields in engineering, including designing computer vision algorithms that can analyze task-specific features from the environment and robots that autonomously navigate in hazardous environments where external help signals such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are unavailable. Based on these advances, the team will develop a new computational neuroscience course focusing on mechanistic models of neural circuits that have been validated in biological brains. The researchers will also reach out to high school students and families to increase awareness in neuroscience with hands-on lab experiences demonstrating advanced neuroscience techniques, such as using optogenetics to alter the mating behaviors in flies. Finally, they will provide a career workshop to undergraduate students to help efficiently advance their careers in biological sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The team will investigate how information is transformed across multiple stages of the pathway from the optic lobe to the compass neurons (also called EPG neurons), which encode the fly's sense of direction and share similarities with mammalian head direction cells. This pathway, called the anterior visual pathway (AVP), has three major types of neurons. MeTu neurons, which receive input in the Medulla (optic lobe) and send axons to the Anterior Optic Tubercle (AOTU), respond to specific visual primitives such as certain wavelengths and light polarization. TuBu neurons integrate the output of MeTu neurons from a specific spatial area, such as vertical or circular areas. Finally, ER neurons, which are postsynaptic to TuBu neurons and serve as the last stage of visual scene processing before the compass neurons, interact with each other to preprocess information about multiple visual features before they are integrated by compass neurons. The team will identify the visual features that two ER types extract along the AVP. To this end, they will tether flies and place them in a custom-built virtual reality arena that spans 360o azimuth and projects full-color stimuli. Using two-photon calcium imaging, they will monitor neurons? activity in these pathways in response to visual stimuli with various visual features.

After separating from the coast of Japan, the Kuroshio becomes the Kuroshio Extension (KE), an eastward-flowing jet, that then carries these waters in the direction of the US. While flowing northward and eastward, respectively, the Kuroshio and the KE exchange heat with the atmosphere which influences weather patterns and long-term weather fluctuations in the region, but also over the North American continent. This project seeks to investigate recent changes in the Kuroshio/KE path that have been occurring since 2018 and that are referred to as a ?regime shift?. The newly detected path involves a large Kuroshio meander south of Japan and a KE system consisting of a highly stable jet that flows eastward without creating many additional meanders or pinched-off eddies. The goal is to explore, with available data and models, what caused the regime shift and what the regime shift means for North Pacific oceanic and atmospheric conditions, with implications for North American weather patterns. This project will provide training for one graduate student who will learn about ocean-atmosphere interaction in the Kuroshio/KE system and other extratropical regions. <br/><br/>The emergence of a new dynamic Kuroshio/KE regime has added new complexity to the understanding of the variability in the North Pacific coupled ocean-atmosphere system. It is hypothesized that the new, on-going dynamic regime is a result of combined external wind forcing, of nonlinear interaction between the Kuroshio large meander and stabilized KE jet, and of coupled feedback by KE?s thermal forcing to the overlying atmosphere. By conducting analyses of available satellite/in-situ data, ocean/atmosphere reanalysis products, and high-resolution coupled model output, the plan is to (1) elucidate the oceanic and atmospheric processes responsible for generating and sustaining the on-going Kuroshio/KE dynamic regime, (2) explore and contrast the basin-scale atmospheric responses to the Kuroshio/KE dynamic regime changes, and (3) quantify the impacts by the new Kuroshio/KE dynamic regime on changing upper ocean heat content and water mass properties in the northwestern Pacific basin. Since many of the scientific questions addressed in this proposal apply to other western boundary current systems, an improved understanding of the KE variability could serve as a useful step in elucidating ocean's role in extratropical ocean-atmosphere interactions in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The uniquely human ability to understand language is shaped by the words and structures that are most frequently encountered, in a process known as adaptation. However, most work on adaptation has focused on ?small units? like speech sounds, words, and sentences. Much less is known about how people use common patterns in conversation and discourse to develop robust mechanisms for understanding language in context. This project tests the ability to track patterns in reference ? that is, who or what is referred to ? including how human learners extract reference patterns and how doing so changes interpretation of a speaker?s meaning. Understanding this kind of adaptation in language could explain how people adjust to differences in communication styles and why language use changes across generations. This project provides scientific training for the next generation of STEM scholars by supporting the development of skills in experiment implementation, statistical analysis, and written and spoken science communication.<br/><br/>This project focuses on words that depend on context to clarify the speaker?s intended meaning. For example, in ?the professor told the student to edit their paper,? ?their paper? could refer to the student?s paper, the professor?s paper, or a joint paper by the professor and student. The context is useful, in part, because people learn which types of references are most frequent. However, it is not yet known how many different frequency patterns people can track. Using an experimental approach, this project tests how adaptation to specific linguistic patterns influences reference interpretation. Specifically, this study examines whether people track multiple reference patterns simultaneously and how such adaptation is used to develop effective processing strategies. By testing the generalization of adaptation, this project discovers whether different types of referring contexts are considered the same for the purpose of adaptation. Moreover, this work examines adaptation as a mechanism for explaining why language changes over time and how speech patterns lead to shifts in how language is interpreted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will consist of hands-on activities that provide practical experience with science and engineering practices, as well as exposure to pathways to careers in biological research. The leaders of the research activities will receive valuable training in effective scientific communication. <br/><br/>In Drosophila melanogaster, direct nutrient sensing by the ovary and remote nutrient sensing by the adipose tissue regulate oogenesis; however, the different modes of amino acid sensing used are not fully understood. The overall goal of this work is to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate dietary protein sensing and communication. This work leverages the power of D. melanogaster genetics to perturb the amino acid response pathway, a branch of the integrated stress response that senses limitations in amino acids, in specific ovarian cell types, to assess its currently unknown role in oogenesis. Additionally, a targeted candidate approach will be taken to identify adipocyte-derived factors that function downstream of the amino acid response pathway and mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling to regulate ovarian germline stem cell maintenance and ovulation, respectively. Taken together, this project will define the molecular mechanisms that govern amino acid sensing in and communication between ovarian and fat tissues. A post-doctoral fellow and both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program, the BIO-IOS-Animal Developmental Mechanisms Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drug discovery and development is time consuming and costly with high failure rates. Success often depends on reliable identification of potential drug candidates in the early stage of the pipeline. Virtual screening of large numbers of compounds has been very useful in identifying additional drug candidates for experimental validation and subsequent optimization. However, there still exists an unmet need for improved virtual screening due to the billions of chemical compounds and unknown target molecules or biomarkers. AI technologies have had considerable impact in drug discovery. Improved predictions by AI-based technologies can significantly accelerate virtual screening or early-stage drug discovery and hence subsequent drug development in many disease areas, providing broad economic advantages in terms of time and cost in both biomedicine and healthcare.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a general meta-modeling framework of ligand-protein binding affinity prediction by integrating traditional physical docking tools and sequence-based artificial intelligence (AI) models. The technology has more than 1,000 pre-trained, sequence-based, deep learning models using 10 different architectures and more than 200 pre-trained machine-learning meta-models. The combined models have shown superior performance in three different benchmarks compared to exclusively structure-based AI models, suggesting that scalable virtual screening is possible without structural data for accurate prediction of binding affinities. A key advantage of the technology is to leverage the ensembling power of multiple tools and datasets in multi-dimensional ways, reducing model-specific bias and enhancing model-specific strengths. The technology expands the scope of diverse drug targets, providing new avenues for different diseases. In particular, the innovation may help discover and optimize small molecule ligands for challenging target proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This problem has been overcome with the discovery of novel compositions that demonstrate efficacy equal or superior to many of the first line therapies used to treat immune diseases. The improved safety, efficacy and lower cost of these therapeutics should provide a significant benefit to patients by overall contributing to their quality of life as compared to current medications, as well as marketing and partnering advantage in its commercialization efforts, which will focus on rare diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis and pediatric Crohn?s disease among others. In the era of socio-economic disparities, these affordable drugs will become available to the historically neglected low-income communities. If executed successfully, this proposal would validate the platform technology and demonstrate the feasibility of identifying candidates for further development into life-changing treatments.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the unique design of novel compounds to augment and re-program the immune responses from pro- to anti-inflammatory, based on the binding to MHC class II molecules that leads to immunomodulation. The technical complexities of understanding the effects of peptide sequences on the outcomes of cellular interactions present challenges related to selecting the appropriate amino acids both for the random and specific components of these compositions. These hurdles will be addressed by design of several candidate compounds for each target condition, juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis and pediatric Crohn?s disease, that will take into account the structure of autoantigenic peptides known to interact with both the MHC class II and T cell receptor (TCR). These candidate compounds will be initially tested in vitro in human macrophages to assess their potential to inhibit secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of these compounds, the most efficient ones will be tested for activity in relevant animal models.

Understanding how these circuits work has been a major goal in cell biology.  Most tools available to researchers involve breaking  molecular circuits, for example by removing one or more of the proteins in the network.  This project will develop a method for adding new connections to the networks inside a cell, by implanting a physical electronic device that can interface with the cellular circuits, providing  a completely new type of tool for studying how cells make decisions and carry out complex behaviors.   If the project works, it could usher in a new era of convergence between molecular biology and microelectronics, with impacts on basic biology, biotechnology, and the semiconductor industry. Broad application of this approach will require a workforce with comprehensive understanding of both electronics and cell biology. A key broader impact of this project is that it will create an unprecedented opportunity for trainees from both electrical engineering and molecular cell biology labs to become cross-trained in both fields, via personnel exchange between research groups as well as pioneering interdisciplinary courses in cellular electronics. Another broader impact will be development of public outreach by showcasing new demonstrations at the Exploratorium science museum. <br/><br/>This project is based on the hypothesis that intracellular signaling network models could be tested more rigorously, and networks reprogrammed to a wider range of behaviors, if it were possible to modify the links between nodes by introducing new functional connections between signaling proteins.  It is difficult to create new connections between proteins using conventional molecular biology approaches. This project will develop a radical solution to address this problem by implanting microelectronic chips into living cells, which will sense kinase activities and/or monitor the concentration of second messenger molecules, and then trigger release of mRNA, siRNA, or small molecules to target specific signaling proteins, effectively ?rewiring? the signaling pathway under electronic control. These chips will integrate biochemical sensors and actuators on a single chip, complemented by wireless communication and power delivery systems, controlled by onboard logic, all engineered to be of a size suitable for implantation into living cells. The device will incorporate nanofabrication techniques and advanced integrated circuit design to achieve a final chip size smaller than 100 m by 100 m, and 10 m thick, allowing it to be accommodated within a single cell. The focus of this proposal is to conduct proof of concept experiments to determine the feasibility of this vision. At each step of the project?s progression, prototypes will be tested within living cells, using the giant amoeba Chaos carolinensis because of its large size and amenability for microsurgical implantation.

Infections related to implanted medical devices are shockingly common, as one million implant-related infections occur each year in the United States. These infections are usually treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, overuse of antibiotics can cause multi-drug resistance, leading to more severe infections, making them harder to treat. There is a higher five-year mortality rate for prosthetic joint infections than for breast cancer. These infections not only present significant treatment challenges due to a biofilm formed by colonizing bacteria, but they also impose a massive financial burden on the healthcare system, costing more than $8.6 billion annually. This proposal addresses this critical issue by creating a novel nano-biological coating designed to inhibit biofilm formation and protect against all types of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, while ensuring high biocompatibility. As such, the primary target market for this technology is medical device manufacturers, particularly in the orthopedic implant sector, anticipating $8 million in revenues by the third year of commercialization. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of a novel mammalian cell-based nano-biological coating when applied to orthopedic implants and demonstrate that the nanoparticles that can limit infection and inflammation while promoting bone growth. Nanoparticles are well known to reduce infection but how they are coated on medical devices remain problematic and undescribed.  This proposal will establish an innovative approach to treat medical devices with nanoparticles to inhibit bacteria via cell stimulation. Several technical challenges that arise from stimulating cells to produce nanoparticles on medical implants, include optimizing nanoparticle synthesis, in vitro characterization and validation, and in vivo proof-of-concept studies. Commercialization of this technology depends on establishing a controlled production system, scaling up production, obtaining regulatory approvals, and achieving market launch. The specific technical objectives of this SBIR Phase I are: (1) Characterization of nanoparticles produced by different cells on Ti6Al4V and stainless-steel orthopedic implants, (2) Determination of the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of such coated surfaces, (3) Determination of bone and fibroblast cell proliferation on such coated implants, and (4) Determination of the performance of nanoparticles produced by the cells as the active ingredient from such coated surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project will develop a bioabsorbable magnesium alloy for maxillofacial fixation. This innovation aims to improve healthcare outcomes by eliminating secondary hardware removal surgeries, which occur in 5-20% of maxillofacial fixation cases and cost the U.S. healthcare system $1.72 billion annually.

The length of telomeric DNA in different animals and plants varies substantially, but the significance of this variation for organismal integrity is not fully understood. This study will analyze the importance of having long or short telomeres for plants grown in good or stressful environmental conditions. Specifically, it will evaluate the number of seeds produced and the timing of flowering initiation as a measure of plant adaptation to stress. The project will also help extend hands-on research options for undergraduate students. It will also provide many opportunities for STEM-themed outreach activities to increase scientific literacy and to advance career preparation for the next generations of biology students.<br/><br/>Telomeres are evolutionarily conserved protein-DNA complexes that cap linear eukaryotic chromosomes and ensure proper genome maintenance and stability. In humans, the length of telomeric DNA is often viewed as one of the most accurate cellular markers of biological age. However, in plants and many other organisms the significance of telomere length changes over organismal lifespan or in response to environmental stressors is largely unclear. Recent findings in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that natural variation in telomere length influences reproductive fitness and the timing of floral transition. Nevertheless, the exact molecular and genetic mechanisms linking telomere length with plant developmental traits are unknown. Through several transcriptome and candidate gene analysis projects this study will elucidate the functional crosstalk between telomere length regulation and flowering time control. It will also characterize the effects of telomere length variation on plant fitness and decipher molecular mechanisms acting on extreme telomere length phenotypes. Finally, the project will aid in developing career-shaping research and educational experiences for undergraduate students.

The school will be held the at the CIRM-Centre International de Rencontres Mathmatiques near Marseille, France, while the two workshops will take place at the IHP. This school will offer an opportunity for US based graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to learn a variety of topics on higher rank geometric structures from international experts. The two workshops will bring together researchers throughout the world and give the US based attendees a venue to exchange ideas and make connections with their European and international colleagues. The primary focus of the award is to support travel for early career US-based mathematicians.<br/><br/>The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has a long history with connections to many different areas of mathematics including geometry, dynamics and number theory. Some of the earliest advances in the field (of Mostow, Margulis, Ratner) were about characterizing rigidity. For example, showing that a group is isomorphic to a unique lattice in a Lie group. On the other hand, Teichmller theory and Thurston?s theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds involved studying the deformation theory of hyperbolic 2 and 3-manifolds. While Thurston developed this theory in the 70?s (depending heavily on the earlier work of the Ahlfors-Bers school) this deformation theory of flexible groups was largely undeveloped outside of these two examples. This changed two decades ago when Labourie introduced the notion of an Anosov subgroup and Fock- Goncharov gave coordinates for studying certain discrete representations of surface groups in semi-simple Lie groups. Since then, the subject has grown immensely and attracted a multitude of researchers. This award will give the opportunity to early career mathematicians from the US to learn from and interact with experts from all over the world who are leading the field. <br/><br/>Further information about the school and workshops can be found at the website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11551/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, over 70 million tons of PG are produced each year, with over 1 billion tons stored in Florida alone. Improper storage risks contaminating groundwater and harming nearby communities by allowing radioactive elements and heavy metals to leach into aquifers. Moreover, radium in PG can decay into radon, a carcinogenic gas. The proposed innovation aims to address those environmental risks directly and offers substantial commercial opportunity by generating up to $50 million in annual revenue per processing facility, cleaning and converting over 200,000 tons of PG per year. Thus, this innovation addresses a pressing need for sustainable waste management, mitigates groundwater contamination risks, and transforms problematic waste into economically viable resource.<br/><br/><br/>PG is a byproduct of phosphoric acid production and includes naturally occurring radionuclides, making the material radioactive. These radionuclides are found in phosphate rock and are mostly uranium, thorium, and radium. This project focuses on developing an innovative, eco-friendly process technology that employs double salt formation using one or more ionic salt solutions to release all the contaminants from the gypsum crystal structure. After separating the double salt from those contaminants, gypsum is regenerated and converted into ammonium sulfate and calcium carbonate through the company?s proprietary process that uses flue gas as a source of CO2.  The contaminants can be either separated or disposed of safely. The project aims develop process conditions that achieve consistently high separation efficiency for broad range of PG feedstocks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LA metropolitan area sits above a deep sedimentary basin that significantly affects the level of ground shaking from local and regional earthquakes. The basin has a complex tectonic history of extension and compression and is also crosscut by numerous faults. This has resulted in a complicated subsurface structure that leads to significant variation in site amplification of seismic waves across the basin, as evidenced by the recorded ground shaking following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake. In the summer of 2022, a temporary 300-node geophone array was deployed across the entire LA basin, providing a seismic data set with uniform and dense coverage for the first time. In this project, the researchers will analyze these data and combine them with other available seismic and gravity observations in the region to construct a detailed 3D basin model. The model will help explain the level of amplification in different areas of the basin as well as its lateral variations The resulting model may be used to model ground motion for realistic earthquake scenarios, which is vital for evaluating infrastructure preparedness.  In addition, this project will explore the connection between the resulting seismic velocity model with mapped geological features, and the tectonic evolution of the LA Basin. Through the research, the project will support graduate and postdoctoral education, and the scientific findings will contribute to seismic hazard assessment efforts in southern California.<br/><br/>The density of the 300 sensor LA nodal array deployed in 2022 will enable the use of novel passive seismic imaging methods. By extracting Rayleigh and Love surface waves from multi-component ambient noise correlations, it will be possible to measure their velocity dispersion and Rayleigh wave ellipticity in the region. Techniques based on particle motion and apparent slowness will be developed to isolate different modes of surface waves. Both isotropic as well as radially and azimuthally anisotropic basin structures will be investigated using surface wave measurements. By using receiver function and autocorrelation methods, in addition to surface wave properties, it will be possible to determine crustal discontinuities, including major intra-basin sedimentary interfaces, the bottom of the basin, and the shape of the Moho beneath it. The use of gravity data will guide the identification of converted and reflected phases and determine the tectonic extension that the basin has experienced, enabling evaluation of the extent of thermal subsidence that has occurred within it. The dataset that will be analyzed is unique in an academic setting for its density, regularity, and completeness of coverage, allowing for the exploration of new methodologies. These include mapping shallow seismicity to identify possible unknown faults, using reflected surface waves to map the properties of faults within the basin as well as discover new ones, and determining aspects of the stress field through anisotropy. The 3D basin model constructed in this project is expected to be more accurate than the current community velocity models (CVMs), enabling more reliable ground motion predictions for various earthquake rupture scenarios. The new model will be validated through simulations of recent earthquakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accordingly, organisms normally maintain defense systems to silence (turn off) the gene expression from this potential intruder. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa (an orange bread mold), a defense system operates during the sexual cycle to minimize the production from an unpaired gene. It is called Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA (MSUD), and it utilizes an RNA-based gene silencing system to single out its targets. The goal of this project is to better understand the mechanism behind the MSUD pathway. Since DNA segments lacking a pairing partner are also targeted in worms, mice, and humans, this project will shed light on how DNA pairing could affect gene regulation in a variety of organisms. The investigators will recruit and train undergraduates through different campus student success programs. Research activities from this project will be used to develop lesson modules for lab tours and outreach visits to a local elementary school. Efforts will also be made to promote scientific literacy, interdisciplinary partnership, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education.<br/><br/>In many organisms, robust genome surveillance mechanisms are used to keep transposons and other selfish elements from spreading. One example is the MSUD pathway, which is first described in the filamentous fungus N. crassa. In this pathway, an unpaired gene generates a silencing signal (in the form of small interfering RNAs), which subsequently turns off the expression of this unpaired DNA as well as any other copies in the genome. MSUD utilizes Argonaute and other common RNA interference (RNAi) proteins to suppress the expression of its targets. Using the tools they have developed (e.g., silencing mutants, cellular markers, gene placement systems, and various assays), the investigators will characterize the phenotypes of silencing-deficient mutants and investigate the interactions and specific roles of MSUD components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these structures, especially in long questions such as ?What does her mother think she is reading?? requires children to grasp intricate relationships between words and hold information in memory while comprehending longer sentences. Remarkably, by age four, children achieve this feat despite two major challenges: (1) cognitive limitations, such as reduced memory capacity compared to adults, and (2) variations in language input, as children are exposed to widely different linguistic environments but still succeed in learning these complex relationships. This research investigates theories of language learning and examines whether they can account for children?s ability to overcome these challenges. The findings provide valuable insights into the processes of language acquisition and child development, as well as practical strategies to support children?s learning.<br/><br/>The project employs computational cognitive modeling to implement a learning theory of wh-dependency acquisition. This approach concretely specifies how the learner processes wh-dependencies in child-directed speech and how the learner outputs behavior that demonstrates adult-like wh-dependency knowledge. To implement the two sources of limitations outlined above, this research tests the performance of the learning model under child-like memory limitations and examines how the model behaves with input across different environmental settings. To ensure the learning theories reflect real-world scenarios, the research also expands a database of child-directed speech to better capture the input children encounter. By precisely implementing learning theories and aligning them with limitations children face, this project aspires to uncover foundational principles of language learning and further our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that support this remarkable ability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Four questions guide this research: (1) What types of activities took place in the different buildings, and how did different social groups participate in them? (2) how did the structures change over time? (3) what role did the structures play in existing interregional interaction and exchange spheres? and (4) on a regional scale, how does the distribution of U-shaped structures reveal patterns of societal organization?

In cereal crops such as economically important corn, wheat and rice, inflorescences have complex branching patterns. The number, length and position of branches collectively compose architecture, an agronomic trait that impacts grain yield and harvesting ability. Inflorescence architecture in cereals is controlled in part by the timing in which a developing branch terminates in a grain-bearing unit called a spikelet. While spikelet development is generally conserved across cereals, little is known about the mechanisms that control it at the molecular level. This project aims to dissect the molecular underpinnings of spikelet development and identify control points for precision breeding or engineering high-yielding cereal crops. The proposed work leverages the model cereal Setaria viridis, which is closely related to corn but is small and rapid cycling, making it ideal for lab-based hypothesis testing. It also has a unique inflorescence architecture where spikelets can be converted to sterile branches, and vice versa, through applications of growth hormones. This genetic system enables rapid discovery that can be directly translated to corn and other cereal crops, ultimately impacting crop productivity and food security. The project also provides cross-disciplinary training in advanced molecular and microscopy techniques and computational biology for undergraduates and high school students. A curriculum based on this project will be deployed in high schools and community colleges, from rural to city schools, providing research experiences that link molecular lab skills to concepts in food security and impacting future workforce development.<br/><br/>Inflorescence architecture is an important agronomic trait, directly related to grain yield and harvesting ability. Architecture is determined by position and fate of differentiating stem cell populations called meristems. In grasses, different meristem types and variations in their determinacies give rise to diverse, complex branching patterns of the inflorescence. This proposal is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling cell fate decisions during inflorescence development and how those decisions determine architecture and grain bearing potential. The work takes advantage of the model grass Setaria viridis because of its unique inflorescence architecture and emerging breadth of genetics and genomics tools. In Setaria spp., inflorescence branches terminate in either a grain-producing spikelet or sterile bristle, and these structures are paired. The loss-of-function bristleless1 mutant is defective in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and fails to initiate a bristle identity program, resulting in homeotic conversion of bristles to spikelets. In contrast, mutations in the spikeletless (spkl) gene convert spikelets to bristles. Spkl encodes a panicoid grass-specific transcription factor and functional ortholog of maize ramosa1 (ra1), a domestication gene that impacts harvestability by conferring meristem determinacy in ears. Despite its importance in evolution and development, the molecular mechanisms surrounding RA1 function in maize and other panicoid cereals is largely unknown. This proposal aims to i) leverage the unique spikelet vs bristle program in Setaria to dissect molecular mechanisms controlling this core genetic module involving RA1 and growth hormones in shaping meristem fate and inflorescence architecture, and ii) extend these findings through comparative approaches to closely related cereal crops maize and sorghum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced techniques such as autocorrelation and wavelet coherence analysis will be used. Ultimately, by revealing causal mechanisms linking tidal day-to-day variability to ionospheric changes, this research will play a significant role in enhancing I-T predictability during geomagnetically quiet times, driving future advancements in whole atmosphere modeling, improving operational forecasts at NOAA/SWPC, and strengthening global space weather resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current oxyfluoride process is a semi-batch process that relies on consumption of a graphite anode which produces carbon dioxide and perfluorocarbons pollutants. The direct generation of perfluorocarbons, which are strictly regulated by the US EPA, makes domestic deployment of the oxyfluoride process challenging and costly. A novel alternative molten salt electrolysis process has been developed that is more electrically efficient than oxyfluoride. However, the process was originally developed for intermediate temperature, solid neodymium reduction. To achieve cost-competitiveness, this project aims to advance the novel process to run stably for extended durations at higher temperatures where liquid neodymium can be produced continuously, achieving cost-advantaged neodymium reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Invasive plants threaten biodiversity by outcompeting native species, disrupting plant-pollinator interactions, and degrading soil conditions, resulting in over $3 billion in annual economic damages in the United States. This project addresses a critical question in ecology: why do some non-native plants become invasive while others do not? Understanding the traits that promote invasiveness is essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The findings from this research will inform conservation strategies, enabling practitioners to identify and manage high-risk invasive species and protect vulnerable ecosystems. Beyond its scientific contributions, this project will foster the development of a skilled scientific workforce through the mentorship of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, independent research opportunities, summer educational programs, and a community-oriented ornamental garden initiative.<br/><br/>This research investigates the mechanisms driving plant invasions by examining how aboveground and belowground traits contribute to invasiveness and influence soil communities and ecosystem processes. Specifically, the study will explore the interplay between analogous traits - such as specific leaf area and specific root length, and leaf nitrogen and root nitrogen content - to understand their role in invasions. The project integrates field experiments and modeling to (1) identify plant traits that drive invasions under varying disturbance and resource conditions, (2) evaluate their effects on soil food webs, and (3) investigate how plant traits interact with soil communities to influence nutrient cycling. By comparing invasive plants with closely related native and non-invasive exotic species, this research will advance our understanding of plant-soil interactions in invasion ecology and generate actionable knowledge for managing invasive species. The outcomes will bridge gaps in ecological theory while offering practical tools to address the ecological and economic challenges posed by invasive plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On Earth, the flow of liquid is mostly controlled by gravity.  In the absence of gravity, capillary forces (surface tension) govern flow.  In space, water in a glass would not remain conformed to the shape of the glass. In space, water?s shape is driven by capillary forces, and would cover all sides of the glass and form a blob over all surfaces.  The absence of gravity also means the absence of buoyancy.  On Earth, a closed bottle of water with some air would have the air on top, but in space, the air bubbles could be anywhere inside the bottle and have any size. This project focuses on molten metallic alloys, which are a liquid useful for brazing and soldering in space for repair of damaged surfaces (due to impact of micrometeoroids and space debris), as well as for construction in space.  Such alloys melt and solidify gradually.  The goal is to control the concurrent melting and capillary flow of a molten alloy in microgravity and predict the resulting microstructure of the bond.  This project is ensuring durable bonding for repair and construction in space man-made habitats and impacting the ability to control other liquids in space and on Earth.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>It is observed that near-eutectic binary alloys, subject to concurrent melting and capillary/gravitational flow, are prone to flow-induced segregation whereupon it solidifies into two very different microstructures. The extent of segregation varies, apparently depending on the processing conditions as well as on the geometry of the capillary flow. This project consists of: (i) a series of experiments performed on the U.S. International Space Station with simultaneous ground-based experiments, and, since the melting/flow solidification process cannot be observed directly ?  (ii) a detailed mesoscale modelling program of the process (phase field computations). The objectives of the project are to: (i) understand the detailed physical mechanisms of segregation during capillary flow under both microgravity and terrestrial conditions. Focus is being afforded to the effects of gravity, temperature gradients, peak temperature, and interaction of diffusion-controlled melting and flow of the melt. This activity also allows for the formulation of the mathematical/computational theory needed to operationalize this understanding. (ii) apply this theory to the design of methodologies for brazing and soldering in both space and terrestrial materials bonding.The new theory and predictive models being produced in this work utilize a phase field formulation of the capillary flow under conditions of void formation and is being verified through the experiments capturing the differences in microstructure of the re-solidified melts obtained in microgravity and under terrestrial conditions. In addition to brazing metals, the results will be relevant for capillary phenomena involving low temperature soldering as well as processes related to bonding of ceramics and metals at high temperatures.  Furthermore, the findings of this project are leading to better understanding of capillary phenomena involved with multilayer metal deposition in advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing via selective laser melting. Educational broader impacts include the addition of new modules to the existing graduate courses at Washington State University and the University of Kentucky, research experience for undergraduate students, and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers struggle to deliver these expensive proteins into diseased cells where they are needed. Right now, tiny particles made from polymers, lipids, or gold are used to carry genome editor proteins into cells. Polymers, which are long chained molecules, consume fewer proteins per treatment, which makes it easier to produce these treatments in large amounts at lower costs, benefiting more people. However, polymer chemists do not fully understand how the length of the polymer chain, the chemical makeup, and other properties of the polymer match different genome editor proteins and different cell types. This proposed research will innovate methods to efficiently test different combinations of polymer designs and quickly find the best designs for each cell type and each genome editor protein. The goal is to apply machine learning and advanced polymer science methods to understand why some polymers work well in delivering genome editor proteins to cells while others do not. Polymers discovered in this CAREER project using these cutting-edge methods will advance basic biological research and improve public health. In addition to the research, the principal investigator plans three educational activities that will support this research area. First, a mentoring program will prepare high school students and undergraduate students from under-represented backgrounds to prepare for careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine. Second, the PI and her lab members will continue creating and delivering lesson plans that spark interest in polymers research in high school chemistry classrooms across Colorado. Finally, the PI will design and teach an undergraduate course to impart data science and lab skills that students need to succeed in the gene therapy industry.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and base editors have revolutionized both basic biological research and the therapeutic landscape for several diseases (e.g., sickle cell anemia). Ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are biomolecular complexes of genome editor proteins and single guide RNA that perform site-specific genome editing. RNPs are far more precise and efficient than plasmid- and messenger RNA-based genome editors but are also more challenging to deliver. This CAREER project will realize RNPs? potential in research and in medicine by overcoming intracellular delivery barriers unique to RNPs. The first goal is to reveal how the chemical identity and spatial distribution of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or charged monomers modulate polymer?RNP binding affinity, RNP loading per polyplex, and polyplex size distribution. Then, the principal investigator and her team will ask whether polymer design criteria overlap or diverge across surface-chemically diverse RNPs: spCas9 nucleases and the more cationic ABE8e base editors. Segmental similarity analysis will tailor polymer composition to accommodate each RNP species? unique distribution of amino acid residues and surface  chemical features. Bayesian polymer design will simultaneously explore untested chemical domains and exploit high-performing regions in the vast design space. The final goal is to elucidate design principles underlying cell-type-preferential RNP delivery. Brute-force testing of all polymers in all cell types is infeasible, especially if we consider the difficulty of expanding and maintaining some primary cells. Instead, recommender systems (e.g., algorithms that match Netflix users with movies given incomplete information on user preferences) will map polymers? cell type preferences. This project will innovate biomaterial design frameworks that are generalizable to molecules beyond RNPs (antibodies, probiotics) and materials beyond polymers (lipids, polypeptides). The project will grant new mechanistic insights into polymer-mediated RNP delivery and lower the cost of deploying RNPs in basic biological research and genetic medicine. This project will also diversify the future workforce through a unique educational plan that will engage students from high school all the way to graduate school through near-peer mentoring, high school outreach, and an undergraduate class on data-driven biomaterial design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of the climate change, more intensive wildfires with higher plume injection heights are expected to occur. Despite great importance, the magnitude and even the sign (warming or cooling) of wildfire smoke on the Earth?s climate are still unknown. To address these issues, the project will predict the fire intensity and plume injection height in a timely manner as well as quantify the impacts of fire smoke on the Earth?s energy budget and climate, which are critically important for the policy makers and stakeholders. The improved estimation of fire radiative effects will enhance our ability to predict relative warming/cooling effects on the Earth system and greatly benefit teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at the Texas A&M University. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the importance of two fire properties, i.e., plume injection height and absorption of dark brown carbon (dBrC) for the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs).

The project will focus on the three scientific issues: (1) radiative effects of BBAs associated with fire plume injection height and dBrC absorption; (2) controlling factors that determine the wildfire intensity distribution; and (3) potential positive feedback between extreme wildfires (wildfires with high intensity) and climate change (e.g., through diminished polar ice/snow cover). To address these scientific issues, the researchers will: (1) incorporate the existing modeling efforts of plume-rise model and dBrC absorption into the NCAR Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2).

The high-temperature laser beam used for additive manufacturing of metal alloys usually produces highly heterogeneous microstructures that result in large inhomogeneous residual stresses in 3D-printed materials. Residual stresses are generally detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component, thus limiting the wide adoption of additive manufacturing in engineering applications. While the macroscale residual stresses have been widely studied in the field of metal 3D printing, the origin and control of the microscale residual stresses remain largely unexplored. This collaborative research aims to understand and control the microscale residual stresses in additively manufactured stainless steel. Due to its excellent combination of mechanical properties, corrosion, and oxidation resistance, stainless steel is a workhorse material used in a wide range of applications such as cars, ships, airplanes, nuclear power plants, medical implants, etc. The research will investigate the effects of 3D-printed microstructures on the resultant microscale residual stresses in stainless steel by integrating microstructural characterization, mechanical testing, and computational modeling. Mechanistic insights gained will be applied to guide additive manufacturing, so as to mitigate the microscale residual stresses in 3D-printed stainless steel. Results from this research will lay a solid foundation for future development of additively manufactured metallic materials with tailored microstructures and outstanding mechanical performance. The project will promote teaching, training, and learning through multi-discipline approaches, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, and enrich curriculum development efforts, particularly in the interdisciplinary areas of materials science and advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Additive manufacturing of metal alloys via laser powder bed fusion and laser engineered net shaping technologies features highly localized melting processes, fast cooling rates, and strong temperature gradients. These extreme laser-printing conditions result in highly nonequilibrium microstructures that lead to severely inhomogeneous residual stresses in additively manufactured materials. The research aims to elucidate the fundamental relationships between the additive manufacturing methods, heterogeneous microstructures and microscale residual stresses in 3D-printed stainless steel. The project consists of two major thrusts. Thrust I involves 3D printing, microstructural characterization, mechanical testing and in situ synchrotron x-ray measurements of residual stresses in stainless steel for a large range of printing schemes and parameters, and accordingly a variety of printed microstructures. Thrust II involves the development of microstructure-sensitive crystal plasticity finite element models that account for the heterogeneous grain structures and sub-grain solidification cell structures. The impact of both intergranular and intragranular residual stresses on the mechanical responses of printed samples will be systematically studied by combining experiments and simulations. Mechanistic insights gained will be applied to guide the optimization of printing schemes and parameters, so as to alleviate the microscale residual stresses in 3D-printed stainless steel. The integrated experimental and modeling approach developed is generally applicable to understand and control the residual stresses in other additively manufactured metal alloys. The project will engage high school students and underrepresented minorities for research.

While much is known about wildfire smoke, a significant knowledge gap remains about how far toxic chemicals spread from the active burn areas. To find out, Dr. Spada and his community partners set up an air monitoring network at locations across the Los Angeles area, downwind of the largest fires. These monitors continuously collected smoke, dust, and ash while the fires were still active and throughout cleanup activities. For millions of Los Angeles residents, these measurements will provide answers about how much toxic chemicals were released, how far they traveled, and when is safe to return to burned areas. Insights gained from this project will help bridge our knowledge gaps and allow us to be better prepared for the future.<br/><br/>This RAPID grant will support field research to collect, archive, and characterize samples during and immediately after the Los Angeles (LA) fires that started on January 7th, 2025. The aim of the project is to quantify the concentration and determine the speciation of toxic elements in airborne particulate matter (PM) collected during and following the fires. Specific objectives are: 1) To collect and archive PM during and following the fires; 2) To quantify the concentrations of elements in all samples; 3) To disseminate validated findings appropriately in order for public health and government agencies to provide accurate recommendations for residents returning to their homes; and 4) To share collected materials with scientific collaborators to maximize the learning potential from this unique scenario. Ambient PM was collected using cascading impactors with rotating stages at four locations distributed across the LA area. Samples will be analyzed initially at Crocker Nuclear Lab?s 76-inch isochronous cyclotron using Proton-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE), Proton Elastic Scattering Analysis (PESA), and Rutherford Backscattering Analysis (RBA). These combined measurements provide quantitative results for non-volatile H, C, and O alongside Na ? Br and Pb. To the team's knowledge, this will be the first dataset of its kind. Subsequent measurements will include Synchrotron-induced X-ray Fluorescence (SXRF) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource to measure higher atomic weight elements such as cadmium, cesium, and rare earth elements. Supporting measurements will include mass concentrations via soft-beta ray attenuation and broadband optical spectroscopy, which will enable factorization and source apportionment analyses by future collaborators. The sampling campaign captures PM during the fire, immediately after the fires were put out, while the burn areas were still smoldering, and during cleanup activities that may resuspend toxic substances. These results will provide information on the exposures to first and second responders and to residents downwind of the fire areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Access to clean water is dwindling due to climate-induced droughts and growing populations. Currently, about 800 million people lack access to safe water, highlighting the need for complementary technologies like AWE alongside desalination. Addressing water scarcity requires a broad range of solutions, and AWE offers promising potential. AWE technologies also apply to humidity control and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy reduction, crucial for rising cooling demands driven by growing populations and increasing temperatures. These technologies can efficiently extract water by more than 80-90% compared to traditional air conditioning. This dual-purpose functionality could make AWE a game-changer for domestic, commercial, and industrial systems, drastically lowering energy input for humidity management. By developing innovative materials and devices, this project aims to alleviate water stress and significantly cut energy consumption in HVAC and humidity control applications. Its impact extends beyond water production, addressing critical global challenges like sustainable cooling and energy efficiency while contributing to water and energy security.<br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a functional atmospheric water extraction (AWE) device by addressing four key objectives: device modeling, adsorbent optimization, alternative adsorbent formulations, and testing various form factors for the adsorbent block. The project will create a heat transfer model using standard heat pipe calculators to optimize radiator fin dimensions, spacing, and heating power, ensuring efficient desorption without requiring a vacuum. The target operating temperature for desorption is 60-100C. The proposed device is designed to produce or remove at least 1?1.5 gallons of water within 12 hours under ambient conditions, with higher water yields in environments with greater humidity. This capability is made possible by an advanced AWE adsorbent, which exhibits superior water capacity across the full range of ambient humidities. This innovation is crucial as existing adsorptive water harvesting systems fail to deliver cost-effective, energy-efficient water production across the wide humidity spectrum of 10?80% relative humidity. By optimizing materials and device configurations, this project will lay the groundwork for a commercially viable AWE system that addresses global water scarcity challenges while offering significant energy efficiency improvements compared to existing technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins perform important functions in cells. Cells build proteins using small molecules, called amino acids. Amino acids occur in two mirror image forms: L-amino acids and D-amino acids. L-amino acids are used in proteins, but D-amino acids are not. It is not understood why L-amino acids are specifically used in proteins, but it is known that using D-amino acids can be fatal to bacterial cells. Enzymes within a cell can typically recognize either L- or D-amino acids. There is an enzyme, ProXp-x, which is an exception; it recognizes both. This project will investigate how the enzyme, ProXp-x, prevents D-amino acid use in proteins of soil-dwelling bacteria. This research will determine how ProXp-x recognizes D- vs. L-amino acids, and how ProXp-x protects bacterial cells from D-amino acid toxicity. The findings will fill gaps in the field?s understanding of protein creation and enzyme function, adding to the field?s fundamental knowledge of enzymes and how cells adapt to stress. This project will also train a team of undergraduate researchers, create several exhibits and games about molecular biology and biochemistry for the Joseph Moore Museum (a natural history museum on Earlham College?s campus), and lead to the publication of classroom materials to use the project as an interactive laboratory experience.<br/><br/>The project will characterize how ProXp-x identifies and binds its targets and determine if its activity prevents D-amino acid toxicity in living bacteria. D-amino acids can be mischarged onto tRNAs, preventing accurate protein production. Many bacteria encode D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases (DTDs), an enzyme that removes D-amino acids from D-aa-tRNAs. Soil-dwelling Rhizobia bacteria do not encode DTDs, but do encode ProXp-x. Unlike DTDs, ProXp-x does not recognize all D-aa-tRNAs or Gly-tRNA. Instead, ProXp-x activity appears dependent on the specific combination of amino acid and tRNA in the aa-tRNA. The project will employ undergraduates to conduct mentored research to study ProXp-x in Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Project aims include using kinetic assays and binding experiments with purified protein and aa-tRNAs to determine how ProXp-x distinguishes between mischarged L- and D-aa-tRNAs, specifically identifying the tRNA features recognized by ProXp-x and the active site residues that recognize the aminoacyl-moiety. Students will also measure R. palustris growth phenotypes and D-aa-tRNA levels in cells to determine if ProXp-x prevents D-amino acid toxicity.

In October 2024, wildfires in Western North Dakota burned over 110,000 acres, significantly impacting croplands, rangelands, and unmanaged ecosystems. Soil microbial communities, which drive nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and plant recovery, are particularly vulnerable to fire-induced disturbances. Disruptions to these microbial processes can lead to long-term declines in soil fertility, reduced crop yields, and compromised land productivity, threatening both local economies and national food security. However, the dynamics of microbial recovery in human-managed systems remain poorly understood. This RAPID project takes advantage of a critical time-sensitive window to investigate wildfire-driven shifts in microbial communities and soil function before they are obscured by seasonal agricultural activities. Without immediate study, key microbial and biochemical transitions may go undocumented, limiting our ability to develop effective recovery strategies. By tracking microbial composition, functional genetic activity, and soil toxicity across different land-use types, this research will provide much-needed insights into ecosystem recovery dynamics. Findings will inform sustainable land management strategies, ensuring that agricultural soils remain productive and resilient in the face of increasing wildfire disturbances. The study will also support North Dakota?s agricultural sector by guiding post-fire recovery efforts that protect soil fertility and mitigate nutrient loss, benefiting both local and national food security.<br/><br/>This study integrates high-resolution microbial and biochemical analyses across three critical post-fire time points: immediately after the fire (November 2024), pre-planting (March 2025), and post-growing season (September 2025). Soil samples will be collected from burned and unburned sites within agricultural, rangeland, and unmanaged ecosystems to compare microbial recovery trajectories. Next-generation sequencing of bacterial and fungal markers will assess microbiome diversity, while digital PCR will quantify functional genes related to nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and carbon cycling. Soil toxicity and respiration assays will evaluate microbial activity and overall soil health. Multivariate statistical analyses and microbial network modeling will be applied to identify key drivers of microbial resilience and functional restoration. This interdisciplinary approach will provide critical data to policymakers, land managers, and researchers working to mitigate the ecological and agricultural consequences of wildfires. Outreach efforts through extension services, field days, and public engagement will ensure that research findings translate into actionable strategies for sustaining fire-affected landscapes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference brings together scientists studying a range of molecules that regulate plant growth. The conference promotes interactions and scientific exchange between researchers with scientific backgrounds and interests that cross disciplines and scales. Such interactions will expose participants to the latest advances in the field as well as to an international research community. This exposure will play an especially significant role in advancing the professional development of early-career scientists helping to accelerate the training of the next generation of researchers. This exchange of information is also critical to develop applications related to these molecules to increase crop yields, stress resistance, and improved post-harvest storage to improve food security. Novel information and ideas from this conference will be shared with other scientists via review and perspectives articles to broaden scientific research on plants.<br/><br/>Diffusible chemical signals play critical roles in the growth, development, and stress responses of plants. These signals are known collectively as plant growth regulators or substances. IPGSA 2025 will bring together established scientists, early-career faculty, students, postdoctoral fellows, and those new to the plant growth substances field to discuss the latest advances in the regulation of plants by these chemical signals. The IPGSA meetings are unique because, unlike other conferences that focus on a single molecule or class of molecules (auxins, ethylene, etc.), the IPGSA conferences span all small molecules that regulate plant growth, thus promoting an integrated understanding of the regulation of plant growth, development, and responses to stresses. The science presented at IPGSA 2025 will involve integrating across scales, providing links between processes at the molecular and cellular levels to growth responses at the tissue and organismal levels. This will include systems-wide studies that have facilitated the development of predictive models for growth-regulator signaling and for signal integration between different growth regulators. Talks will include interdisciplinary areas including the use of mathematical modeling to explore the topology of gene regulatory networks, the use of chemical biology to understand and control hormone signaling, studies of the plant microbiome that integrate microbiological and plant genetic approaches, and the use of a combination of biology, biophysics, and computational approaches to model hormone receptor structure.

Reinforcement learning, a data-driven control method that enables agents to autonomously learn desired tasks by interacting directly with the environment, has emerged as one of the predominant frameworks for this kind of real-time decision making. While reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework, it suffers fundamental challenges in its scalability and resilience. Specifically, existing methods require a vast amount of data and computational power and can be unstable in the presence of various types of errors and adversaries. These challenges are the main barriers to the wide applicability of reinforcement learning for real-world problems. This CAREER project will develop new foundations of scalable and resilient distributed reinforcement learning for real-time autonomous cooperation in open multi-agent systems. The overarching goal is to design new learning and control methods that enable agents to interact effectively in open systems, adapt gracefully in time-varying environments, and be resilient to unexpected failures and adversaries. The project will also contribute to education and workforce development by integrating the research findings with rigorous educational and outreach activities, course development, student training, and public partnerships.<br/><br/>The central idea of this project is to establish new fundamentals of two-time-scale stochastic approximation for non-monotone systems.

By leveraging these new results of two-time-scale stochastic approximation, this project will advance several foundational aspects of distributed learning and control in open multi-agent systems. The focus is to develop new scalable and resilient distributed multi-time-scale reinforcement learning methods that allow agents to cooperate efficiently in real-time under diverse practical considerations, including time-varying numbers of agents, unexpected failures, communication constraints, and adversaries.

This project aims to design efficient codes capable of correcting such limited magnitude errors, thereby enhancing the reliability of these systems. Additionally, in communication and magnetic recording systems, synchronization errors can occur in two forms. The first type is a deletion error, where a transmitted symbol is not received. The second type is an insertion error, where an unexpected spurious symbol is received. The propagation of these errors can greatly reduce the performance of these systems. This project plans to design efficient codes capable of correcting these types of errors, thereby improving the overall performance and robustness of these systems.

Involving students in the proposed research will give them valuable experience transferable to many industry and career paths. <br/><br/>At present, most known codes are designed using the power sums of index sets over a Galois field GF(q).

Current vulnerability detection approaches at the hardware level focus on post-hoc patches applied after hardware is deployed, but to date these solutions have been short-lived and inadequate for long term protection. Furthermore, standard methods to evaluate security at the computer hardware level are basically non-existent, leading to ad-hoc custom solutions. As a result, industry stakeholders do not have the tools they need to compare the security of different architectural designs and cannot make informed decisions about the trade-offs between performance and security. This project proposes new abstract methods for reasoning about hardware vulnerabilities and builds an evaluation infrastructure that can be easily integrated into commonly used hardware design tools to incorporate security metrics. In addition, this project investigates a new angle for reasoning about vulnerabilities at the computer architecture (or microarchitectural) <br/>level resulting in more robust hardware designs. This project introduces a new programming interface for programs to state the desired memory region to be used and an abstract model to represent vulnerable microarchitectural structures. The outcomes of this project have the potential to help industry identify security challenges at hardware design time and make informed decisions about security tradeoffs. The microarchitectural attacks and defenses topics are introduced to computer engineering education as standard modules in both undergraduate and graduate level courses. The developed computer engineering course within the Precollegiate Development Program brings computer engineering concepts to a diverse population of high-school students.<br/><br/>The project addresses modern vulnerabilities in the microarchitecture by introducing a new interface to represent expected regions of memory. This new interface helps address the root of most microarchitectural vulnerabilities: the unauthorized access to sensitive data. The project further explores a method to differentiate ?normal? from ?abnormal? memory access patterns and then uses the normal memory region to establish protection mechanisms. In addition, it expands gem5, a commonly used performance evaluation tool, with abstract-based models that represent microarchitectural attacks to enable computer experts to reason about security challenges. The project includes several case studies in which the proposed security evaluation methods can shed light of the security or insecurity of microarchitectural designs. The novelty of this work lays in exploring a new angle for mitigating microarchitectural vulnerabilities and for exploring security metrics that can be incorporated into the existing hardware design cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(1) Community Detection in Spatial Networks: Traditionally, probabilistic network models have not included a spatial dimension and thus do not accurately reflect transitive behavior in real-world networks, for example, ?the friend of my friend is also my friend.'' The project will work towards a theory for spatial networks, answering foundational questions on statistical limits and developing efficient algorithms for inference. (2) Optimization for Inference: Optimization algorithms have been used with great success for inference problems on networks, yet there are some problems for which we do not know whether an optimization algorithm is the best algorithm for a given task. The project will investigate the power of optimization algorithms for network inference tasks, including semidefinite programming for community detection and quadratic programming for graph matching.

OT has been studied   extensively in mathematics, engineering, physics, economics, operations research, and computer science because of their numerous applications. Despite extensive work, computing OT plans has remained a computationally challenging problem, and  there is a large gap between the theory and practice of OT algorithms. The need for fast OT algorithms is becoming even more urgent with the proliferation of machine learning and algorithmic decision making in all disciplines. The scarcity of scalable algorithms that compute high quality transport plans  has limited the applicability OT to many applications.<br/> <br/>The main goal of this project is to advance the theoretical underpinnings of OT and to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of OT algorithms. By exploiting combinatorial, geometric and statistical properties of OT, leveraging new approaches for min-cost flow, and exploiting approximation and probabilistic techniques, simple and scalable algorithms will be developed for computing high quality OT plans of both discrete and continuous distributions whose supports are compact regions in Euclidean space. The emphasis will be on designing combinatorial algorithms that not only have good worst-case running time  but that have better expected running time on stochastic or semi-stochastic inputs.  The project will also explore techniques to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, which arises in the OT of high-dimensional distributions. Building on these OT algorithms, new algorithms will be developed for data analysis (e.g. clustering, training neural networks) on a family of distributions in Wasserstein space, i.e., using OT as the distance between a pair of distributions; for quality assessment of algorithms that return a probability distribution (e.g., flood-risk-analysis algorithms that return a distribution of water over a region).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge in limiting such collection is that it often takes place for legitimate reasons that are deeply intertwined with the proper operation of the applications themselves. In particular, many applications require some form of user authentication, which often, as a side effect, enables tracking of the user?s journey. This project aims to develop new privacy-preserving techniques that address this inherent tension by enabling authentication methods that reveal only what is strictly necessary. The planned work will establish new theoretical foundations, produce practical solutions, and inform ongoing standardization efforts in industry. The project will also enhance the undergraduate research experience in cryptography at the University of Washington and introduce a new approach to teaching cryptography at the undergraduate level.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the project will advance the theory of blind signatures and anonymous credentials, two cryptographic primitives that underpin most privacy-preserving authentication solutions.  A key focus will be on more efficient and flexible constructions of these primitives, and on proving their security under the weakest possible cryptographic assumptions. Formal security models will support these efforts, and enable rigorous proofs of security.  Two main objectives are to design best-possible constructions from elliptic curves and to develop new techniques to ensure security against quantum attackers. The project will also explore protocols for threshold issuance of blind signatures, distributing the issuance process among multiple parties to eliminate single points of failure. In addition, it will examine the concrete security of the digital signatures behind anonymous credential systems, and investigate the design of larger-scale secure protocols using these primitives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education.

However, trace amounts of sulfur exist as dissolved organic sulfur (DOS). Research on DOS in the ocean began in the 2000?s. This is because it is difficult to measure DOS concentration in a solution having almost one million times more inorganic sulfate. While relatively small in quantity compared to inorganic sulfur, DOS plays critical roles in oceanic and atmospheric processes. For example, sunlight degrades DOS into carbonyl sulfide gas, which moves into the upper atmosphere, forming sulfate particles that block sunlight reaching the Earth. Many DOS compounds are essential for microbial growth in the ocean. Additionally, some DOS compounds react with essential (e.g., zinc) and toxic (e.g., mercury) trace metals to affect their solubility and biological availability. To uncover the mysteries of DOS, this study will utilize archived samples collected from over 100 locations in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Antarctica and collect fresh samples in the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. The scientists will measure the total concentrations of DOS in these samples and determine the compounds that make up DOS. Graduate and undergraduate education is a central part of this project. The project will support one graduate student at Old Dominion University and graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. The scientists will share their research with the public through already scheduled lectures and forums. They will also develop and use a virtual reality (VR) experience to simulate what it is like to go to sea and collect samples for DOS.<br/><br/>This research project will uncover the processes governing the marine DOS cycle in the Pacific Ocean, with three primary objectives: 1) Accurately quantify the DOS inventory across the entire Pacific Ocean to clarify its role in the global sulfur cycle. 2) Identify the abiotic and biotic processes responsible for DOS production and removal along two meridional Pacific transects, encompassing different biogeochemical regimes, hydrothermal plumes, and oxygen minimum zones. 3) Conduct a year-long, monthly collection of depth profiles at the Bermuda-Atlantic Time Series (BATS) to investigate the reactivity of DOS and its components. The research will leverage archived samples from three Pacific meridional transects, spanning from Alaska to Antarctica and Antarctica to Mexico, along with newly collected samples from the monthly BATS cruises. The project will improve understanding of the inventory and cycling of DOS in the ocean and provide research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.

Tropical montane habitats change quickly as one travels upslope due to rapid changes in temperature, precipitation, and plant life. Narrow bands of high-elevation habitats are sometimes called ?sky islands? due to their patchy and isolated distributions. These ?sky islands? can harbor species with similarly narrow distributions, creating specialized communities that are isolated across mountain ranges. This research examines the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of bird communities of Polylepis forests in the Central Andes Mountains of Peru and Bolivia. Polylepis forests are the highest-elevation forests in the world, occurring from 3500?5000 meters above sea level. These forests are highly fragmented, with differences in the connectivity and size of forest patches. Researchers will sequence DNA from populations of approximately 30 species of birds that live in Polylepis forests and the adjacent grasslands. The researchers will assess connectivity among populations and determine if certain characteristics, such as the ability to fly long distances, are associated with differences in population connectivity among the bird species. Current species? classification will be evaluated in light of the population-level DNA data and data on bill shape, body size, and feather coloration. This project will provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate students by establishing the Museum Undergraduate Science and Exploration Opportunities (MUSEOs) program at the bird division of the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Sciences. This new curriculum will use a near-peer network of mentors to expand entry points and progression routes for students in research and curation. The research will also foster international collaboration in the documentation of biodiversity in remote, understudied regions of South America. Finally, the project will build museum collections, advancing collections-based ornithology and biodiversity research.<br/><br/>This research will characterize the diversification dynamics of Andean ?sky island? avifauna through the comparative phylogeography and integrative taxonomy of birds in the Polylepis woodlands of the Central Andes.

This effort intends to enable national leadership in cutting-edge engineering, promote scientific progress, and advance societal welfare by ensuring that future large-scale systems are designed with mathematical rigor from the earliest stages. The educational component of the project is focused on transforming the way students learn about and approach engineering problem formulation, equipping the next generation of engineers with advanced formal reasoning skills.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this CAREER project is on developing theoretical foundations for representing and reasoning about engineering problem spaces through the integration of Modal Preference Logic, Systems Theory, and Set Theory. The research establishes formal definitions, axioms, and theorems for analyzing the consistency, completeness, and validity of problem space elements and their transformations. Automated reasoning tools will be developed to support practical application. The methodology will be validated through formal mathematical proofs and real-world case studies of space systems at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshal Space Flight Center?s Advanced Concepts Office. Scientific contributions include a unified logical framework for representing diverse problem space elements, formal criteria for assessing problem formulation quality, and theoretical foundations for verification and validation integrated directly into the problem formulation process. The framework will be implemented through an ontology that enables automated reasoning about complex system specifications while maintaining mathematical rigor. The educational component of this project integrates these formal methods into the engineering curriculum through advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, ensuring that students gain hands-on experience with rigorous logic, problem formulation, and automated reasoning. Partnerships with the Alabama Space Grant Consortium will expose high-school and university students to cutting-edge methods and tools, broadening participation in engineering fields and preparing a workforce that can confidently meet the complex engineering challenges of tomorrow. By linking cutting-edge research with classroom teaching, and educational outreach, the project provides a comprehensive solution that supports both the scientific community and the broader national interest in reliable, efficient, and innovative engineering systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite its widespread adoption in biotechnology, many questions remain regarding how Cas9 functions in nature. Cas9 main biological function is to protect bacteria from viral invaders known as bacteriophages, or phages for short. These CRISPR-Cas9 systems acquire memories, in the form of DNA fragments, from prior phage infections, allowing bacterial cells to rapidly kill the same phage when it is encountered again in a later infection. This project will explore the hypothesis that a class of phages called ?temperate phages? that are often neglected in CRISPR-Cas studies hold the key to understanding CRISPR-Cas memory acquisition. These results will inform new generations of Cas9 technologies, including molecular recording devices, and highlight how CRISPR-Cas systems and temperate phages together influence the evolution of bacterial communities. The project also details an educational plan that will provide undergraduate students an opportunity to learn more about the arms race between bacteria and their phages and careers in microbiological research.<br/><br/>A central question in CRISPR-Cas memory creation is how cells survive a lytic phage infection long enough to create a new memory and utilize it for defense. Intriguingly, many CRISPR systems target temperate phages, which are capable of entering a program called ?lysogeny?, in which their DNA is inserted into the bacterial chromosome, where it may remain in a dormant form. This proposal tests the hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems can exploit the temperate lifecycle by acquiring memories about those phages under non-lytic conditions. Specifically, the proposal examines whether new memories can be made during the initiation of lysogeny (aim 1) and/or after lysogeny has occurred and the phage has integrated into the chromosome as a prophage (aim 2). Finally, the proposal tests whether prophages can influence the ability of CRISPR-Cas systems to acquire memories from other infecting phages (aim 3). Temperate phages are understudied in CRISPR-Cas laboratory experiments, because the rates of lysogeny are significantly higher than spacer acquisition. This proposal will employ new genetic tools to thoroughly dissect the interactions between CRISPR-Cas systems and their natural temperate phage targets, revealing a new paradigm for how CRISPR-Cas immunity is established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective combination drug therapies optimize the therapeutic effects of these drugs and minimize harmful and/or uncomfortable side effects. Many diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer?s, heart disease, and life-threatening infections, are treated by drugs used in combination. Amazingly, the use of these drug combination is guided by analytical methods that are over 100 years old. Researchers have developed the first components of a new analytical toolkit for combination drug discovery and development across a range of disease indications. This STTR Phase 1 research project will enable the commercialization of this toolkit by discovering how to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to sift through a range of existing (and future) laboratory and clinical data to find the drug combinations that work best. The combination drug toolkit may create significant value for its customers by (1) improving target selection, (2) reducing the number of drug development programs that fail, (3) increasing the efficiency of clinical trials data analysis, and (4) extending the patent life of important drugs with new viable combinations.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to leverage improvements in quantitative understanding of drug ? drug synergy to overcome challenges associated with the optimization and discovery of combination drug therapies. The Multidimensional Synergies of Combination (MuSyC) algorithm is valued as an improvement in understanding drug ? drug synergy by rigorously defining synergy of efficacy and synergy of potency and extracting these different synergies from experimental data sets. The proposed research seeks to innovate the means of data production and integration across diverse data sources and merge this with additional relevant databases and clinical data to create an effective analytical toolkit for optimizing all stages of combination drug research and development. The research plan consists of an experimental track and a computational track. The experimental track will use the MuSyC algorithm to inform experimental design and high-throughput data collection for three use cases of considerable clinical relevance. In parallel, the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning approaches will be used to integrate diverse data sets with the MuSyC algorithm to predict synergies of combinations. The data track and the AI-track will then be merged to provide proof-of-concept for an AI-enabled MuSyC toolkit for optimizing combination drug use and discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The location of the conference at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA provides an inspiring and historical setting since it is the location of many groundbreaking discoveries. Over a four-day period, attendees from all stages of the profession come together to present their research, exchange ideas, share new techniques, build community and discuss best practices and ideas for STEM education. The conference intentionally supports junior scientist attendees. Scientific breadth is an important feature of DBSUMI, and the conference structure promotes formal and informal interactions among participants to build new collaborations across fields. The conference and the research performed by the attendees focus on creative and original research that leverage animal diversity to answer fundamental questions in the field of developmental biology. Previous examples of fundamental discoveries from research on marine invertebrates include the identification of cyclins and the control of cell division, the role of microtubule motor kinesins, the isolation of green fluorescent protein and the concept of gene regulatory networks. Such discoveries are central to most aspects of modern biology, and curiosity-driven research presented at conferences such as DBSUMI have the potential to lead to additional ground-breaking discoveries. The Broader Impacts of this award are multiple and include supporting trainees and the next generation of STEM researchers, sessions on new tool developments, and a STEM education session.<br/><br/>The DBSUMI conference convenes at the Marine Biological Laboratory every 1.5 years and brings together a large community of over 100 researchers who utilize marine invertebrates for fundamental studies in biology. In addition to research presentation opportunities, attendees are invited to participate in a pre-conference workshop on technology advancement, career development workshops and a STEM education plenary and panel discussion. While originally conceived for investigators working with sea urchins and which generated the first gene regulatory network (GRN), DBSUMI has more recently diversified with respect to research organisms, topics, and the breadth of attendees. This breadth serves as a valuable incubator to build new collaborations across fields. Topics currently discussed cover a range of subdisciplines, including oogenesis, gamete interactions, the oocyte-to-embryo transition, body axis patterning, signaling, organogenesis, regeneration, immunity, and environmental influences on development. Methodologies used by DBSUMI researchers are also broad and include GRN-based approaches, genomics, experimental embryology, cell biology, advanced imaging and evolutionary comparisons. Recent technological advances spurned in part by sea urchin researchers have lowered barriers to work with novel animal systems and has motivated the community to grow by including research on additional marine invertebrates. Parallel research efforts across a wide range of study animals placed within a phylogenetic context has allowed this research community to reveal common mechanisms defining unifying biological principles. Currently, this conference is unique in its focus on comparative development of marine invertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combining single-cell profiling, culturing, and microscopy-based analyses, this project will infer species boundaries, describe new species, and improve reconstructions of the tree of life. Gene families will be analyzed to shed light on putative adaptations that allow survival in extreme environments. Integration of project data will be coordinated with public biodiversity databases and strain collections to enhance access to microbial resources. A summer training workshop will aid in training early career protistologists in the characterization of unknown protist lineages, with modules focused on biodiversity, species discovery, and systematics.

The first strand is focused on the design and enactment of an online video-based professional development for video club facilitators of mathematics teachers. The second investigates facilitator learning and ways to support it. The project will iteratively design resources for facilitator educators that can guide and support the future development and enactment of learning experiences for facilitators of video clubs and video-based professional development, something that is currently missing in the field. The research questions are: (1) How can an online, video-based professional development support facilitators in learning to lead teachers in a video club? (2) In a facilitator professional development, how do facilitators learn to support teachers? noticing? An important part of the facilitator professional development design includes helping facilitators learn to use teacher video annotations as a window into teacher thinking during video clubs.

Though membrane fusion has been studied for decades, the regulation of membrane fusion in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) delivery is still poorly understood. This project will describe key steps in the delivery process and aims to identify novel proteins involved in receptor trafficking during learning and memory.

Though membrane fusion involved in the delivery of neurotransmitters is well-characterized, comparatively little is known about the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor delivery. Membrane fusion during AMPAR insertion into the plasma membrane is driven by SNARE proteins, including syntaxin-3, synaptobrevin-2, and SNAP-47 (S47). This project will investigate the role of S47, specifically focusing on its poorly characterized N-terminal and linker domains.

In this project, the researchers will answer fundamental questions about host-parasite resource competition using state of the art analytical chemistry techniques to quantify within-host resources. The answers to these questions will allow researchers to predict the course and outcome of parasite infections and, in the long-term, potentially design innovative new treatments.

For this reason, there is profound scientific interest and financial investment aimed at harnessing plant-microbiomes to improve agriculture to achieve greater food security and environmental sustainability.

The legume, or bean, family is the second most agriculturally important crop family. This project will leverage the extensive resources available in Medicago to map the genetic basis of microbiome variation and validate the functional significance of candidate genes that are identified. Additionally, this work will examine connections between known plant-microbe symbiosis genes and interactions with the broader microbiome. This project will also provide research training for high school science teachers from Chicago Public Schools and develop novel teaching modules based on this research that will be implemented in the classroom and broadly disseminated to the science education community.<br/><br/>Plant-microbiome interactions play key roles in environmental stress tolerance; however, the mechanisms that control these interactions remain poorly understood. While much remains unknown about the genetic underpinnings of the overall plant microbiome, there is a considerable body of literature from decades of research interrogating the mechanisms controlling symbiotic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). Several of the common AMF and rhizobial symbiosis genes are conserved across plant evolution, even in non-symbiotic species, which has raised the hypothesis that symbiosis genes may also play a role in controlling interactions with the broader microbiome. This project integrates forward and reverse genetic approaches to investigate this hypothesis and fill key knowledge gaps regarding genomic mechanisms that shape the microbiome of legumes. This work leverages resources available for the model legume Medicago by conducting genome-wide association studies of microbiome interactions and examination of the impacts of knock-out mutants for AMF and rhizobial symbiosis genes on the microbiome. This work will greatly advance our understanding of plant microbiome genetics and will serve as a guide for future plant breeding efforts to improve agriculture. Additionally, training high school science teachers and developing novel curricular materials are a major goal of this project. Modern science education standards emphasize teaching the practice of doing science though inquiry-based pedagogical approaches. Achieving this can be challenging for teachers without having had experience conducting research. Moreover, new teaching modules are needed that are aligned with modern standards. Project outcomes will be disseminated broadly through publications and long-term, through public data repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates the influence of bots on public opinion about controversial topics such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). By analyzing bot-generated content and its interactions with human users, the study examines how bots influence public discourse and human responses, with a focus on linguistic features such as polarization, politicization, and emotional framing. Understanding these linguistic dynamics sheds light on how bots shape public opinion, amplify narratives, and influence the cognitive processes driving individuals? reactions.<br/><br/>This research expands the computers-as-social-actors (CASA) framework to examine bots' influence on human decision-making, with a focus on both theoretical advancement and methodological innovation. Integrating observational and experimental approaches, it analyzes over 26 million tweets using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The experiment employs LLM-simulated personas as human respondents, comparing their responses to those of real human participants. This approach not only tests bots? influence on decision-making but also demonstrates the potential of LLMs in studying human cognitive processes and decision-making dynamics. Methodological innovations include a bot detection tool leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a sampling technique using LLM-generated personas. These tools ensure robust insights into human-bot interactions while advancing the CASA framework?s predictive capacity. The findings deepen theoretical understanding of human-AI interactions, guide strategies to mitigate bot influence, and contribute to computational social science.

In our bodies, cilia are present in the lungs, brain, and reproductive systems. These cilia beat back and forth with a wave-like motion that moves fluid along the passages. Failure of cilia beating can lead to severe health problems such as lung infections, brain swelling, or infertility. Cilia are also found on many single-celled organisms, in which cilia beating propels the organism through surrounding fluid. In both the human body and swimming cells, cilia beating must be coordinated to be effective. This project will support research that studies how coordination of cilia is maintained in the single-celled organism, Tetrahymena. How changing fluid resistance and altering connections between cilia changes the coordination of cilia beating and affects swimming speed will be studied. This research intends to help understand and potentially treat diseases related to cilia defects. Understanding cilia coordination could also lead to new designs of man-made systems to move fluid or propel objects using multiple coordinated wave generators. This project will also support workforce development through research, education, and outreach. The PIs will train graduate students at the interface of mechanics, biophysics and cell biology, involve undergraduates in summer research and independent study projects during the academic year, and engage K-12 students with hands-on activities to introduce design and problem-solving concepts.<br/><br/>Motile cilia are powered by the ?9+2? axoneme, an array of nine microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of singlet microtubules, connected by a network of passive spokes and links and driven by dynein motor proteins. At the base of the cilium, the basal body (BB) is an array of microtubule triplets anchored to the cell cortex by microtubule bundles (post-ciliary and transverse) and connected to each other via striated fibers. Force transmission between BBs and the cell cortex to reveal how these interactions modulate ciliary beating and coordination will be studied. The first aim is to measure dynamic deformations of BBs in Tetrahymena, using expansion microscopy and super-resolution imaging, and uncover how BB deformations are affected by ciliary beating and intracellular connections. The second aim is to quantify metachronal coordination of Tetrahymena cilia and test the role of connecting fibers in controlling the waveform and timing of cilia beating. Laser ablation will be used to disrupt connections between adjacent cilia and quantify the effects on cilia waveform and coordination. The third aim is to model and simulate the mechanics of cilia beating in Tetrahymena. Two types of computer models will be built: (1) the Axoneme-BB model will be a detailed structural model of the ciliary cytoskeleton and its connections to the cell; (2) the Cilia Array model will be a coarse-grained model of multiple cilia that each exhibit autonomous oscillations, that includes intracellular coupling to mediate metachronal coordination. Comparison of model predictions to experimental measurements will clarify the role of intracellular force transmission in cilia coordination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is an important topic to study because people may behave differently depending on expectations and such thinking can affect important outcomes like pricing. For example, when buying a house Person A may think a price should be based on its current value, but Person B might expect that other buyers will be optimistic about future growth. Thus, Person B may pay more now, thinking they can sell at a higher price later. When many people think like Person B, this can drive up home values beyond their actual worth creating a housing bubble. Another example is salary expectations. When starting a new job Person A might just ask for what they think is a fair salary, but Person B may expect their employer to give a low counter offer after a salary request, and thus ask for more up front, ending up better off. These different strategies can lead to unfair differences in pay. Many economists have shown this to be the case but there is a lack of research on understanding characteristics of people who engage in greater thinking about others? behaviors. This project develops a tool to measure strategic anticipation assessing how much strategy a person uses in how they anticipate, or expect, other people to do in response to their own behavior. If scientists can measure people's strategic anticipation, they can design experiments to test how much it matters in many different settings, such as buying houses and negotiating with other people to get the best salaries. A better understanding of these processes can help people to make better decisions and get fairer outcomes.<br/><br/>This project develops and validates a novel measure of strategic anticipation - the ability to engage in recursive thinking about others' mental states and potential actions. Drawing from economic theories of level-k reasoning and psychological research on theory of mind, the Strategic Anticipation Measure (SAM) provides researchers with a standardized tool to assess individual differences in strategic iterative thinking. The research involves replicating and validating the SAM in a nationally representative sample, ensuring psychometric rigor through measures of discriminant validity and test-retest reliability. Additionally, the project applies the SAM across various social contexts?including voluntary disclosure in test-optional college admissions, self-sacrifice in close relationships, strategic decision-making in resource competition, and responses to shared knowledge in bystander intervention. By establishing the SAM as a reliable measure, the project aims to open new avenues for theoretical and empirical research, advancing our understanding of strategic anticipation in multiple domains of human behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an era of narrowing profit margins and labor shortages, robotic equipment offers the potential to improve agricultural production. Autonomous nursery robots enable management strategies that are not possible with conventional equipment. For example, nitrogen fertilizer can be applied periodically across a plant's lifecycle, reducing stress, enhancing yield, and minimizing material loss through leaching and volatilization. Other applications include foliar feeding, weeding for reduced herbicide use, and field-variable nutrient assessment. These robots also collect data that farmers can use to refine strategies, transforming intuition into data-backed insight. This capability reduces waste, aligns farming with sustainability goals, and meets market and regulatory demands. Additionally, these lightweight robots reduce anthropogenic soil compaction, a common consequence of traditional heavy machinery, promoting healthier soil. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of novel, tactile-based perception and navigation systems designed to allow small off-road robots to operate in messy, stalky row-crop environments like under-the-canopy of a cornfield. This tactile navigation system supplements traditional visual methods, providing redundancy against sensor occlusion and feature extraction difficulties in the presence of weeds and leaves. Nearby stalks and obstacles can be detected and localized in the robot's periphery using tactile sensing, allowing for autonomous navigation even when visual data is unavailable. Robots equipped with this system can autonomously navigate through production cornfields entirely blind, detecting and positioning plants with accuracy. In-season management strategies can be unlocked with a robust navigation system. Early trials demonstrate that yield can be improved by ~10%, using ~20% less fertilizer when the robot spoon-feeds fertilizer to corn slowly over time, providing a clear indication of the economic potential of the technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A deeper understanding of children?s negotiation abilities is useful in thinking about how children solve problems and resolve conflicts. Moreover, it is arguably more productive to intervene in maladaptive decision-making strategies as they unfold in real-time rather than waiting until adulthood when such errors are harder to undo. Developmental and cross-cultural research in this space is useful for educators and policymakers as they engage in training the next generation of critical thinkers and strategic decision-makers. Indeed, this body of work can assist educators and policymakers in creating teaching methods and curricula that foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills from an early age.<br/><br/>This research program explores the development of strategic decision-making. In everyday life, people often must decide how to handle situations in which they either share the same interests with others or have competing interests. In negotiations, the best outcomes are achieved when each person makes concessions on lower-priority interests to make gains on higher-priority interests. Little is known about how the conceptual skills that support successful negotiations develop in the first place and across societies. Across five empirical studies, the study has five overarching goals: (a) probe early markers of effective negotiations; (b) explore young humans? capacity to engage in effective negotiations involving competing and overlapping interests; (c) observe how efficient agreements vary across age groups and regions; (d) examine dyadic real-time negotiation strategies, including personality factors that lead to efficient agreements; and (e) determine the synchrony (or delay) in one?s basic ability to make efficient agreements and its application in real-time negotiations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Earth?s past, the continents had different arrangements to what we are familiar with today. The theory of plate tectonics, which emerged in the 1960s and was formalized in the 1970s, explains the changing face of Earth in terms of the opening and closing of oceans (i.e., creation and destruction of the oceanic crust that floors them). The coming and going of oceans act to fragment and separate continents then bring them back together in new formats. With over 50 years of scientific inquiry since the discovery of plate tectonics, geologists still do not understand the exact processes responsible for the birth and death of oceans. The Atlantic Ocean is 180 million years old and has not yet shown any signs that it is closing. Geological evidence suggests that a previous ocean existed in a similar region to the Atlantic of today; the Iapetus Ocean, named after the father of Atlas in Greek mythology. Geological constraints on the birth and death of the Iapetus Ocean suggest that it began closing less than 80 million years after it opened. Why the divergent fates of these two oceans? The answer to this question may lie in the respective processes that birthed the Atlantic and Iapetus.<br/><br/>This project will test the idea that the process of ocean formation?the style of continental rifting?can impart differential susceptibility to subsequent closure of the ocean basin that forms. Research will proceed via geological, geochemical and geochronological study of fragments of the Iapetus Ocean preserved at five locations between western Scotland and Arctic Norway. Work will focus on the apparent spatial coincidence of records of Iapetus Ocean opening and closing, and implications for the setting in which the closing process was seeded. The project includes public outreach that will benefit local urban population in Baltimore. Summer research internships will provide opportunities for local high school students to get involved in hands-on research. The team will also lead field excursions to explore the ?Baltimore Ophiolite? ? a rare sliver of ancient oceanic crust preserved in an urban setting.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The Wilson Cycle is a cherished concept in plate tectonics. However, an enduring issue with the model is the inherent strength of passive margins, which should resist the implied process of passive margin collapse to initiate subduction. Supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites of the Scottish and Norwegian Caledonides record the first instance of subduction initiation across approximately 2,000 km of the Wilson Cycle?s archetypal ocean, the Iapetus. Seeding work on these SSZ ophiolites suggests a potentially ubiquitous association between records of rifting to open the Iapetus Ocean and those of subduction initiation to close it. These associations provide tantalizing clues that margin structure/litho-architecture inherited from rifting may leave certain passive margins more susceptible to subduction initiation via passive margin collapse.<br/><br/>This project will explore the idea of passive margin susceptibility to subduction initiation by testing two hypotheses: (1) Iapetan subduction initiation occurred in regions that also experienced Ediacaran rifting of Rodinia, and (2) Iapetan subduction initiation occurred in an oceanic setting proximal to the Laurentian margin. Testing Hypothesis 1 will involve geochemical characterization and zircon U-Pb dating of enigmatic metavolcanic packages adjacent to the SSZ ophiolites of Unst, Scotland, and Karmy and Leka, Norway. Testing Hypothesis 2 will involve geochemical and detrital zircon characterization of metagraywackes from the cover sequences of the Karmy, Leka and Lyngen SSZ Ophiolites, Norway.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chronic wounds affect near 50 million patients in developed countries often leading to persistent infections, prolonged inflammation, and increased healthcare costs. Approximately 80% of infections are associated with bacterial biofilms that delay healing and require frequent interventions. Current solutions often rely on reactive infection management and frequent dressing changes.  This project proposes a novel wound dressing with optimal porosity to enable oxygen exchange while creating a pathogen barrier, integrated with real-time detection of infection indicated by a rapid color change. The platform offers a potential solution for improving the management of acute wounds, chronic wounds, surgical sites, and burn, with a total estimated $200M annual market.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop and validate an aerogel-based biomaterial combining fluid management, biofilm prevention, and rapid infection detection properties into a single platform.

The primary layer aims to promote tissue regeneration while blocking microbial infiltration, and the secondary layer aims to absorb wound fluid while providing a visual indicator of infection. The proposed technology development will optimize the aerogel?s pore structure for effective biofilm prevention, refine the infection-sensing mechanism for reliable detection in under a minute, and ensure the mechanical durability needed for clinical use. If successful this project will demonstrate preclinical safety and effectiveness, with scalable pilot production methods for a prototype wound dressing material, that reduces infection-related complications, minimizes dressing changes, and improve healing outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fully-coherent samples, so-called ?quantum gases?, are achieved when cooled to near absolute zero, but this is technically challenging. Recent work, though, has demonstrated that internal quantum coherence can persist even in thermal gases whose temperatures are well above those required to create a quantum gas. The first goal of this project is to determine the limiting conditions for which quantum coherence is preserved in these thermal gases. As such, it will probe the boundary between the classical and quantum regimes and may aid in the development of low-cost quantum technologies. The second goal is to investigate such a gas as it transitions from a thermal cloud to a quantum gas. Depending on the conditions of the experiment, the quantum properties can be either suppressed or enhanced, affecting the complexity of computations and the precision of measurements. The third goal of this project is to integrate quantum science research into undergraduate education. If successful, this will provide a model to make quantum science research more accessible to undergraduate-only institutions, providing enhanced learning opportunities to underrepresented groups in physics.<br/> <br/>The experimental research program will measure ultracold atomic spinor gases with three main goals. The first goal of the project is to determine the maximum temperature for a Bose thermal gas to exhibit coherent spin-changing collisions. All-optical trapping of spinor gases will be utilized to probe the spinor dynamics of samples as a function of temperature. A thermal gas will be coherently prepared with the desired initial spin state, and the resulting population oscillations will be measured through absorption imaging of the magnetic sublevels. Second, the project will investigate coherent spin-changing collisions in the temperature regime as a thermal gas transitions to a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the limiting cases are well-understood, there is currently no theoretical model to describe this intermediate regime. It has been argued that spin-locking between the thermal and Bose-condensed components, for example, can lead to either an enhancement or suppression of the coherence of the thermal cloud. The loss of coherence limits the complexity of computation in quantum information systems and the precision of measurements. Experimental studies will provide needed measurements to develop accurate theoretical models. Third, the project will integrate education and research in quantum physics with reduced technical requirements suitable for primarily undergraduate institutions, providing enhanced learning opportunities for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In our bodies, cilia are present in the lungs, brain, and reproductive systems. These cilia beat back and forth with a wave-like motion that moves fluid along the passages. Failure of cilia beating can lead to severe health problems such as lung infections, brain swelling, or infertility. Cilia are also found on many single-celled organisms, in which cilia beating propels the organism through surrounding fluid. In both the human body and swimming cells, cilia beating must be coordinated to be effective. This project will study how coordination of cilia is maintained in the single-celled organism, Tetrahymena. How changing the fluid resistance and altering connections between cilia changes the coordination of cilia beating and affects swimming speed will be studied. This project will help understand and potentially treat diseases related to cilia defects. Understanding cilia coordination could also lead to new designs of man-made systems to move fluid or propel objects using multiple coordinated wave generators. This project will also support workforce development through research, education, and outreach. The PIs will train graduate students at the interface of mechanics, biophysics and cell biology, involve undergraduates in summer research and independent study projects during the academic year, and engage K-12 students with hands-on activities to introduce design and problem-solving concepts.<br/><br/>Motile cilia are powered by the ?9+2? axoneme, an array of nine microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of singlet microtubules, connected by a network of passive spokes and links and driven by dynein motor proteins. At the base of the cilium, the basal body (BB) is an array of microtubule triplets anchored to the cell cortex by microtubule bundles (post-ciliary and transverse) and connected to each other via striated fibers. Force transmission between BBs and the cell cortex to reveal how these interactions modulate ciliary beating and coordination will be studied. The first aim is to measure dynamic deformations of BBs in Tetrahymena, using expansion microscopy and super-resolution imaging, and uncover how BB deformations are affected by ciliary beating and intracellular connections. The second aim is to quantify metachronal coordination of Tetrahymena cilia and test the role of connecting fibers in controlling the waveform and timing of cilia beating. Laser ablation will be used to disrupt connections between adjacent cilia and quantify the effects on cilia waveform and coordination. The third aim is to model and simulate the mechanics of cilia beating in Tetrahymena. Two types of computer models will be built: (1) Axoneme-BB model will be a detailed structural model of the ciliary cytoskeleton and its connections to the cell; (2) Cilia Array model will be a coarse-grained model of multiple cilia that each exhibit autonomous oscillations, that includes intracellular coupling to mediate metachronal coordination. Comparison of model predictions to experimental measurements will clarify the role of intracellular force transmission in cilia coordination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individual research projects often use the concept of spatial patchiness as a jumping off point for data collection and modeling. However, it is important to discover how the ideas and data about spatial patchiness develop to help guide future research, shape the growth of ecological science, and facilitate the practical use of the resulting ecological information. This project integrates ecological theories and concepts into a broad synthesis. This is important because it provides an understanding of how synthesis has helped translate ecological knowledge for the public good. Additional broader impacts of the products focus on: 1) The relevance of applying science to urban design, urban planning, and conservation; 2) An improved ability to assess disturbance in social-ecological-technological systems given changing environments and changing human vulnerability; and 3) Support of ecological education and mentoring efforts and programs. Products will be broadly useful for public communication and education, and will include a multi-media collection of resources that will make the results of the synthesis as widely accessible as possible.<br/><br/>This project aims to study how such a fundamental ecological concept as patchiness has progressed by synthesizing insights from an exemplary scientific career. The research will focus on how key concepts from community ecology, ecosystem ecology, and urban ecology can be integrated using the theory of patchiness, or heterogeneity, into a cross-disciplinary science of societal importance. The approach is journalistic and interview-based, where the Lead PI will be interviewed by the Co-PI. The synthesis is organized around five thematic modules extracted from the PI?s published record, with each module building on the previous ones while highlighting how new insights and understanding have emerged.

These particles (also called ?particulate organic matter? or POM) carry carbon into the deep ocean where it is stored for hundreds of years. The storage of carbon in the deep ocean contributes to the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as loss of nutrients from the surface ocean. Understanding the mechanisms and processes that govern the fluxes of POM is thus directly relevant to the global carbon cycle, marine ecology, and fisheries. This project uses new tools to measure the isotopes of three different elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen). The approach shows promise for addressing a long-standing question: to what extent do bacteria replace the organic matter from algae (the original source of the POM) as particles sink. Results from this study will be important for predicting the amount and dietary quality of POM in a rapidly changing ocean. The project will support Ph.D. students at both Caltech and University of Miami and educational activities for K-12 and college students. <br/><br/>The project takes advantage of a recent analytical development, the measurement of hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a new tracer. Preliminary measurements suggest that there is a large (up to 20%) shift in the hydrogen isotope ratio of amino acids within POM over the upper 300 m of the ocean, consistent with the depth at which POM degradation is most intense. The investigators hypothesize that the shift in hydrogen isotopes reflects the replacement of phytoplankton biomass with bacterial biomass. The project will test this hypothesis through 1) the analysis of archived POM samples from four different localities in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 2) measurements of diverse phytoplankton grown in culture, and 3) degradation experiments in which algal biomass is fed to bacteria and zooplankton. In addition to cutting-edge hydrogen isotope measurements, the investigators will employ a suite of additional measurements to characterize the microbial communities and POM being studied. Collectively, this work aims to develop hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a novel proxy for the turnover of organic matter within marine particles, which could be applied to studies of marine POM throughout the world?s oceans. The project will also develop outreach activities to introduce K-12 and collegiate students to marine science. These will be implemented through the GO-Outdoors program in Pasadena, the Exploring Marine Science Day in Miami, and undergraduate student cruises in Miami.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, speakers align with each other and become more similar in their language patterns. Such alignment is a core feature of human interaction and is believed to occur mostly without conscious awareness. Previous studies have shown that speakers often align on particular word choices with specific conversational partners and switch to a different word choice pattern when communicating with a different partner. In contrast, when speakers align their sentence structure with a particular conversational partner, they tend to maintain that sentence structure choice pattern even when talking to a different partner. This doctoral dissertation project investigates the possible reasons for the differences in partner-specific alignment at the word choice and sentence choice levels. A main hypothesis tested in this research is that word choice and sentence structure choice may serve different functions and may therefore impact communication success differently, especially in the context of joint task performance. This project also provides ample research opportunities for students and aims to increase awareness of alignment as a tool for language educators and speech therapists. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project uses openly available analysis tools to examine whether speakers align their word (lexical) and sentence structure (syntactic) choices differently depending on their conversational partner in joint task-related dialogue. Specifically, the researchers compare the speech output of participants working in pairs to complete a collaborative spot-the-differences game, either remaining with the same conversational partner or switching partners between rounds of the game. By comparing the alignment patterns of the same-partner pairs with the different-partner pairs, this study will provide insight into the mechanisms and functionality of alignment at different levels of language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fusion of ubiquitous autonomy and connectivity, along with the widespread adoption of distributed energy resources, is transforming our legacy grid into a multi-agent and distributed infrastructure. The project brings transformative change to power grid management by developing innovative strategies to orchestrate the autonomy of cyber-enabled components (agents) to enhance the grid's efficiency, resilience, and sustainability. This is achieved by addressing three critical research questions: how to leverage agents? autonomy for faster decision-making, enhance the resilience of managing a multi-agent power grid, and integrate societal awareness and carbon footprint considerations into distributed power management models. The intellectual merits of the project include the development of novel machine learning (ML)-assisted optimizers to rapidly solve complex decision-making problems for individual power grid agents, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and generative modeling to improve the resilience of collective power grid agents, and the design and integration of societal benefits and sustainability metrics into the multi-agent decision-making paradigms. The broader impacts of the project include enhancing power grid performance and resilience, educating the public through various media (print media and broadcast news), and offering educational and research opportunities for students, government, and industry professionals.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the power grid whose characteristics are increasingly multi-agent and distributed in nature. The efficient operation of future electric infrastructure depends on leveraging agent-level autonomy to enhance grid management functionalities in a timely, resilient, socially aware, and sustainable manner. To achieve this, the project proposes neural approximators for mapping optimization inputs directly to high-quality, feasible outputs, thereby eliminating agent-level iterations and significantly speeding up agents? computations. In addition, this project seeks to enhance the resilience of a collection of agents by using AI to regulate inter-agent communication parameters, using generative models to address data gaps, and dynamically adjusting information dissemination rates during/post disruptions. Finally, the project plans to incorporate societal considerations into distributed power dispatch models by first studying how design parameters, such as computation granularity and strategies for managing struggling agents, affect the distribution of societal benefits and the carbon footprint of distributed computations. These findings subsequently guide the development of socially aware and sustainable models for distributed grid management. The expected outcome of this research is a set of novel analyses accompanied by algorithms, tools, and techniques that harness the autonomy of power system agents to enhance the efficiency and resilience of the nation?s power grids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are also crucial steps in various optimization algorithms including routing, network design, and information clustering. Compared to distances between higher-dimensional data in abstract spaces, distances in real-life networks possess additional structures which often lead to extremely efficient algorithms that are impossible to achieve otherwise. This project aims to develop novel methods to represent, compress, and sketch distances on networks when geometry is present. This is a timely response to the ever-growing need to summarize massive geometric data. By focusing on simple and practical algorithmic solutions, the project provides a useful toolbox for algorithm designers, addressing important open questions at the frontier of human knowledge. In addition, the integrated education and mentoring plan sets the goal to enhance mathematical literacy and critical thinking skills among local college and high-school students in the New Hampshire and Vermont area. <br/><br/>Geometric constraints on graph metrics arise from the interaction between the graph and its ambient space that often comes with simple topological or Euclidean structures. The project focuses on various types of geometric metrics, such as planar distances, p-norms (i.e., a norm on suitable real vector spaces given by the pth root of the sum ? or integral ? of the pth-powers of the absolute values of the vector components) and their generalizations, and hop distances on geometric shapes. These metrics are common in applications like computer graphics, vehicle routing, and shape analysis, and they also appear implicitly in string editing in bioinformatics and configuration spaces in robotics. The main theme is to design a robust and versatile distance sketching toolbox using geometry, with a tradeoff option between accuracy and efficiency, while remaining lightweight in resource usage. The techniques are involved and rely on the interplay between different research fields, such as metric embeddings, topological graph theory, and geometric algorithms, aiming to study optimization from a graph partitioning perspective. These tools will then be used to tackle problems where current algorithmic solutions are inefficient, inaccurate, or nonexistent. The long-term goal is to provide a systematic way to examine distance-related problems, choose the most effective tools, and estimate resource usage before implementation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Algorithmic Foundations program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Efficient and selective electrocatalytic processes for converting electrical energy to chemical energy are essential for a sustainable economy. However, many processes still lack the necessary energy efficiency and product selectivity for practical use. Recent studies indicate that catalytic activity can be enhanced by choosing the appropriate electrolyte cation. To advance this strategy, detailed knowledge of the impact of the supporting electrolyte?s cation on the EDL structure is required but is largely missing. Professor Waegele and his students will use vibrational spectroscopy to examine the distributions of cations and the resulting EDL electric fields as a function of electrode potential. Their studies could provide insights into the key factors influencing the EDL structure and resulting catalytic activity for carbon dioxide reduction, hydrogen evolution, and other technologically relevant reactions. Additionally, Professor Waegele?s team will offer educational opportunities for high school students.<br/><br/>The project team will employ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to probe the potential-dependent structure of the EDL. To this end, Professor Waegele?s group will use multiple vibrational reporters. Briefly, the team will measure how the accumulation of organic cations in the EDL is controlled by their properties, anion identity, and electrode material and characterize the emergent electric field with vibrational Stark spectroscopy. The team will further develop and apply vibrational reporters as quantitative measures of the accumulation of inorganic cations. Lastly, the team will investigate the EDL environment that is experienced by key reaction intermediates in carbon dioxide reduction. The work could provide fundamental insights into the structure of the EDL by unraveling the relationships between cation distribution in the EDL and interfacial electrostatics during electrocatalysis. Results will likely advance the understanding of the EDL under reaction conditions, where application of classical EDL theories is often inadequate. Further, the project could establish how the structure of the micro-environment influences catalysis. This information is essential for designing electrocatalytic interfaces that selectively and efficiently catalyze many technologically relevant reactions.

Human visual processing can be broadly categorized into two types: intuitive processing, which enables rapid, experience-driven decision-making, and deliberate processing, which involves focused and systematic reasoning for complex tasks. Robust visual intelligence, the ability to integrate these types of processing, is fundamental to real-world problem solving and developing common-sense understanding. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems lack this level of robustness, as they often rely heavily on language models to compensate for deficiencies in visual architecture. This reliance becomes a critical bottleneck as tasks and scenarios grow more complex, limiting the adaptability and reliability of AI systems in practical applications. The project aims to build a hybrid, vision-centric framework that integrates intuitive and deliberate visual processing to create more robust visual intelligence. This improved capability has the potential to empower research in many other fields. For example, robotics researchers could use the system to help robots see, move and act more intelligently in challenging environments. Similarly, scientists and educators could use it to better understand complex diagrams, making it easier to uncover new insights and improve learning.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a hybrid approach that combines parametric (intuitive) and non-parametric (deliberate) visual processing methods to build robust visual intelligence. The first direction focuses on developing new ways to learn visual representations using techniques like visual self-supervised learning, language guidance, and generative modeling. And the goal for this direction is to advance vision-centric parametric knowledge to form the foundational layer of intuitive understanding. Building on this, the second direction incorporates human-like non-parametric mechanisms, such as visual search and working memory, to enhance deliberate reasoning capabilities. The third direction integrates these two approaches into a unified, hybrid architecture, where a high-level controller is capable of activating either method as needed for task-specific demands. Finally, the system will be tested in real-world, dynamic environments that extend beyond static image datasets, including tasks requiring long-form video analysis and visual-spatial reasoning. By applying the framework to these new challenges, the project aims to produce more adaptable, reliable, and broadly useful methods that expand the possibilities of vision-based applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, once these smaller tasks are solved, recombining their solutions into a final answer is not straightforward. It requires sophisticated methods to ensure the combined solution is accurate and efficient, especially for tasks in quantum-based machine learning.

Second language (L2) learners whose native language does not use stress to contrast word meaning often face difficulty in perceiving stress in their L2. Even when both languages do use stress contrastively, stress acquisition may be challenging if the two languages differ in their phonetic cues used for stress, or if stress plays a stronger role in differentiating words in the L2 compared to the first. While phonetic training has been shown to be effective for improving the perception of L2 speech segments and tone acquisition, whether it is effective for improving suprasegmental stress perception in a L2 has not been well established. This doctoral dissertation investigates whether the perception of stress by L2 learners may be improved through phonetic training and whether the benefits of training generalize to untrained syllable positions. Additionally, this dissertation investigates the role of attention in the learning of L2 stress. The importance of attention for the acquisition of unfamiliar speech sounds has been discussed by L2 learning models, but few studies have examined its role during phonetic training for non-segmental features. Understanding whether phonetic training is effective for improving stress acquisition and the role that attention plays during training can help inform linguistic theories for L2 acquisition and aid in developing effective pedagogical methods for teaching second language stress.<br/><br/>The doctoral dissertation aims to establish whether the perception and phonological processing of suprasegmental stress by L2 learners may be improved through phonetic training, the role that attentional allocation plays during the acquisition of suprasegmental features, and whether the benefits of training are generalizable to untrained syllable positions. The Automatic Selective Perception model posits that attentional focus is required during the early stages of L2 learning in order to successfully perceive and acquire novel L2 sounds. This predicts that mere exposure to L2 sounds may not result in improving perceptual accuracy if a learner?s attention is not directed towards the feature in question. The present dissertation provides participants with a series of four phonetic training sessions. While all participants are exposed to the same stimuli during training, they are split into two groups with different tasks: a stress group and a segmental group. The stress group receives feedback during training directing their attention to identifying stress placement, while the segmental group has their attention directed to initial consonant voicing.

Turbulence exists in the fluids that we experience every day. The unpredictability of turbulence limits our forecasting ability for everything from weather to air travel. Turbulence also exists in plasmas - the hot, ionized gases that make up most of the visible Universe. Plasma turbulence plays an important role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from black hole accretion disks to the interstellar medium, where the heating from turbulence enables the formation of organic molecules which are the building blocks of life. Plasma turbulence also limits the performance of potential future fusion energy reactors. This research program will develop a new platform for producing turbulent plasma in the laboratory and new methods for measuring plasma turbulence. The award also supports a substantial effort to develop an open-access plasma laboratory class, which includes designing, building, and testing laboratory experiments that can be easily reproduced by other instructors. If successful, this effort will strengthen the US STEM workforce by spreading plasma physics instruction to a broader range of educational institutions.<br/><br/>Just as hydrodynamic turbulence is built from vortices of fluid motions, magnetized plasma turbulence is built from magnetic islands and current sheets, which serve to transfer the magnetic energy between different spatial scales. This project will use an imploding carbon wire-array Z-pinch, driven by the new PUFFIN generator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a magnetic island merging platform to generate magnetized plasma turbulence. This magnetized plasma turbulence will be in a previously unexplored regime: sustained, highly collisional, with an ion-skin depth between the driving and dissipative scales, and energy approximately equipartitioned between magnetic, thermal, and kinetic.  Advanced diagnostics, such as Faraday rotation imaging, Thomson scattering, and imaging refractometry, will be used to study the transition from a laminar to a turbulent plasma.  The diagnostics will serve to characterize the evolution of the power-spectrum and intermittent structures above and below the ion skin depth, and the role of an imposed or self-generated mean-field in correlating turbulent structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the oceans must maintain a balance between alkalinity supplied by continental weathering, and alkalinity removed by calcium carbonate burial, at least over long time periods, a reduction in the burial of calcium carbonate on continental shelves would induce an increase in the carbonate ion concentration of seawater to preserve more calcium carbonate in deep sea sediments. If seawater had a greater carbonate ion concentration than today, then it would absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the exact mechanism(s) responsible for this CO2 variability remain(s) to be determined. To address this key knowledge gap, the investigators seek to test a method for estimating the carbonate ion concentration of seawater in the past. Existing methods for estimating carbonate ion concentration are labor-intensive and expensive. This proposal aims to test a method that would be much faster and much less expensive. The scientific goal is to combine estimates of carbonate ion concentration from marine sediments with the other geologic evidence to determine the relative importance of biological processes and of changes in sea level as factors that contributed to lower atmospheric CO2 concentration during glacial intervals.  Broader impacts activities include training, mentoring, and the involving undergraduate students in research, community outreach events, and workforce development.<br/><br/>The investigators plan to advance the calibration of an existing proxy for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution, and to determine if the proxy also provides reliable estimates of bottom water carbonate ion concentration. Calcium carbonate dissolution in the deep sea is sensitive to changes in bottom water undersaturation (expressed as Delta [CO32-]), so a proxy method for CaCO3 dissolution (Globorotalia menardii Fragmentation Index ? MFI), if rigorously calibrated, should provide a measure of bottom water Delta [CO32-].  The MFI method is rapid, inexpensive, only requires a microscope, and is suited to the involvement of undergraduate students in research on the global carbon cycle. The immediate goal is to determine if the MFI method can be used to provide a reliable measure of Delta [CO32-] through a 3-pronged calibration effort with previously collected samples: (1) Determine the MFI across a range of water depths in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, where Delta [CO32-] and the rate of CaCO3 dissolution have been measured independently; (2) conduct a global survey, including the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, to compare MFI against climatological Delta [CO32-] to assess potential regional variability in the relationship between Delta [CO32-] and MFI; and (3) determine the MFI from marine sediments from the Central Equatorial Pacific, covering the last 160,000 years, in two cores where Delta [CO32-] has already been measured using B/Ca ratios in epibenthic foraminifera.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their controlling influence the clouds themselves are insubstantial, a collection of millimeter-sized droplets formed around micron-sized aerosol particles carried by small-scale turbulent motions. Ideally the aggregate climatic effect of individually insubstantial clouds could be assessed by studying the microscale physics and dynamics that determe their reflectivity, which could then be used to estimate the amount of sunlight they reflect back to space over the whole globe.  While appealing, this simple scaling up fails to account for the two-way interactions through which clouds affect the large-scale conditions in which they occur, which in turn affect the microscale processes that control the clouds.<br/><br/>Research under this award seeks to understand the net effect of clouds on climate, taking into account the interactions between clouds and climate that, taken as a whole, generate the equilibrated response of each to the other. The Principal Investigator (PI) of the award uses the term ""buffering"" to refer to the effect of the climate scale on the cloud scale based on recent studies, including Sherwood and Feingold (2009), arguing that the effect of fully equilibrated shallow cloud changes on global climate is often (though not always) less than what would be estimated by simply scaling up from cloud scale to global scale.<br/><br/>Much of the work in the project is devoted to the development of a model which can simulate the small scales relevant to clouds and turbulence while at the same time covering the whole globe.  Existing models capable of simulating cloud motions are too computationally intensive to run on a global domain, thus the PI has devised a strategy in which cloud-scale motions are captured with machine learning-based emulators embedded in each grid column of a global model.  The emulators are trained on output from a hybrid model in which fine-scale cloud-resolving models are embedded in each grid column of a global model, a descendant of the model developed by the Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes under AGS-0425247.<br/><br/>The new emulator-based model configuration is used to address three questions regarding the equilibrated response of clouds and large-scale climate, the first of which is whether atmospheric adjustments do in fact serve to buffer the radiative effect of aerosols on clouds.  The immediate effect of aerosols on clouds is to make them brighter by distributing cloud water over a larger number of smaller droplets (the Twomey effect), thus buffering would mean changes in liquid water content and areal coverage that counteract cloud brightening.  The second question is whether interaction with large-scale climate reduces the sensitivity of shallow clouds to sea surface temperature (SST) increases, as experiments with fine-scale models suggest strong reductions in cloudiness with ocean warming which would generate further warming. But the reduction in cloudiness found in fine-scale models may be buffered when large-scale equilibration is taken into account.  The third is whether the the adjustment of shallow clouds to aerosols depend systematically on changes in SST when the fully equilibrated cloud response is considered. The question is important as aerosols are expected to decrease as SST increases over the 21st century.<br/><br/>Research under this CAREER award is paired with a suite of educational activities built around the same themes of climate science and machine learning.  One involves the development of a climate emulator with a user-friendly graphical interface for teaching climate science to a broad range of audiences including the general public.  A second creates resources and training opportunities to help high school teachers show their students how scientists develop and use models to study climate and project future climate change.  A third involves public outreach at the Birch Aquarium, where the PI serves as an advisor and contributor to exhibits and public programs on climate and atmospheric science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transport of these proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is thus critical for proper functions of the cell. For many such proteins, nuclear localization signals (NLS) have been identified that mediate the interaction with a nuclear import receptor, which, in turn, facilitates translocation of the transport complex across the nuclear membrane. Nuclear importation is an important aspect of cell signaling. In this study a protein involved in nitric oxide signaling will be studied in order to gain mechanistic insight into how cytoplasmic signals are relayed to the nucleus. This protein (nitric oxide synthase; NOSIP) is a cargo for the prominent nuclear import receptor Transportin (TNPO1) and molecular details of this interaction will be examined. The project will involve complimentary expertise of the Kehlenbach and Chook laboratories. The cellular, biochemical and structural research project will directly link to a Broader Impact project which provides STEM training to local community college students, through hands-on lab work, literature review, generation of public educational resources and development of a comprehensive database of nuclear import cargoes. The project will help prepare the STEM workforce, educate the public and update the research community about nuclear transport, and also provide the research community with updated bioinformatics resources.<br/><br/>Two major research questions will be addressed in the study of atypical recognition of NOSIP by TNPO1. The first investigates the mechanism of NOSIP recognition by TNPO1, with the goal of deciphering the distinct and novel interaction mode. The approach will include the Chook group solving the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the TNPO1-NOSIP complex and comparing it with those of ?classic? TNPO1-PY-NLS structures. The Chook group will also compare the binding of NOSIP to TNPO1 with the interactions of NOSIP with its minor nuclear import receptors. The second major research questions will involve the Kehlenbach group investigating how the interaction of NOSIP with transport receptors and its subcellular localization are regulated by phosphorylation, and how this post-translational modification affects possible nuclear functions such as mRNA-splicing. Together, the Chook and Kehlenbach groups will shed light on the highly unusual interaction mode of TNPO1 with NOSIP as a cargo protein, and on the regulation of the subcellular localization of NOSIP, which seems to play a prominent role in the nucleus.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Germany project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the German Deutsche Forschung Gemeinschaft (DFG) where NSF funds the US investigator and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a long-lived (perennial) crop, grapevines are typically cultivated as a clonally propagated stem (the scion) which is mechanically grafted to a genetically distinct, clonally propagated root (the rootstock). Because grapevines are cultivated as clones, individual plants of the same variety are essentially genetic twins. Thousands of clonal stem varieties are planted across the globe and exhibit large variation in growth, berry chemistry, and wine volatiles based on vineyard environmental conditions and management. This variation in growth and performance is known as phenotypic plasticity and impacts both fruit and wine characteristics, a phenomenon known culturally and commercially as ?terroir?, the signature of the local environment on the vine. Because of their clonal nature, one potential mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in grapevines is changes to the epigenome, a collective term for non-genetic DNA modifications that can change how specific genes and gene pathways are activated or deactivated. The goal of this project is to understand which portions of the grapevine genome are impacted by epigenetic changes, how epigenetic change in the root and the stem interact in grafted plants, and how these changes contribute to optimal plant resilience in response to environmental stress. These results will be used to help plant breeders identify the next generation of elite grapevine varieties and grape growers improve grapevine production across diverse growing regions. Integrated education and outreach include providing research training for project personnel in collaboration with industry partners across six states. In addition, project participants will be involved in outreach and hands-on research training activities that leverage existing programs and partnerships to maximize STEM participation of high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>How do long-lived plants (perennials) acclimate to different environments and what is the extent of phenotypic plasticity possible from a single genome? Grapevines are grown as a composite of a clonally propagated stem (the scion) mechanically grafted to a clonally propagated root (the rootstock).  These unique combinations of shoot and root are planted across diverse geographic regions around the world; consequently, grapevines offer a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of whole-plant, multi-year phenotypic plasticity and enables the experiment disentanglement of the shoot genotype x root genotype x environment interactions across diverse climatic conditions. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop an integrated understanding of how the genome of clonally propagated perennial plants produces ?adapted? phenotypes, from roots to shoots, over time and under different environmental conditions, and to identify the molecular basis of this phenotypic plasticity. This study will use experimental vineyards planted with a single scion cultivar ?Marquette? grafted to three commercial rootstock cultivars, replicated in three different environments (New York, Missouri, South Dakota). The project will use an integrative systems biology approach combining measures of plant physiology, leaf ionomics and metabolomics, fruit ionomics and metabolomics, wine chemistry analysis, and connections between sRNA, mRNA, and cytosine methylation signatures in shoots and roots across sites and their interaction with the spatial and temporal changes that occur in the epigenome in clonal shoots and roots.

The details of how these surfaces evolve as rocks fail hold information to better understand future events and to assess hazards. It is impossible to observe these interfaces in nature. The most informative measurements come from sensors placed at the surface. The goal of this proposal is to instead observe an experimental system to determine how interfaces slip and evolve.

This will be accomplished by directly observing the coupled processes that control nucleation, slow and fast slip, healing, drag, and melting in ice to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the evolution of conditionally unstable frictional interfaces. A series of both static and sliding experiments will be performed using a custom cryogenic biaxial apparatus and a sample of ice atop a glass plate. Ice will be used for two key reasons: 1) it is transparent, allowing light and images to be transmitted through it; and 2) it has a low melting temperature, such that exploring a modest range of temperature covers a broad swath of homologous temperature, T/Tm, and thus both brittle and ductile behavior. This knowledge, analyzed by cutting-edge machine learning data analysis methods and extrapolated up to larger systems, will improve understanding of the mechanics of the entire stick-slip cycle and stability.

When these nutritional ?pulses? occur, they can initiate chain reactions in food webs, as consumers switch from their normal diets to feast instead on the abundant new food items. Understanding the consequences of these food pulses for natural communities ? which organisms are affected, for how long, and if they stop performing their normal ?jobs? to take advantage of the new resource ? can provide insights into how ecological systems function and respond to change. The synchronized emergence of billions of periodical cicadas every 13 or 17 years in the eastern U.S. provides an enormous pulse of insect food for a variety of generalist consumers. The assembled research team will be the first to document the impacts of cicada pulses on the foraging behaviors and population dynamics of one of the most abundant animals on the planet: ants. Results of the study will advance our understanding of how nutrient pulses alter the varied ecosystem services that ants routinely provide, many of which are relevant for both the forestry and agriculture sectors. In addition to training undergraduate researchers in field biology, the research team has created a free digital education program, ?Friend to Cicadas,? the goal of which is to train and empower teachers throughout the entire range of periodical cicadas to provide activities that spark wonder and curiosity in their students.<br/><br/><br/>In this study, the researchers test the hypothesis that most ants will opportunistically adjust their foraging to capitalize on abundant cicada prey, both during the dramatic spring emergence and again when the next generation of cicadas hatches later in the summer. Further, they predict that changes in ant foraging will alter the strength of their competitive and mutualistic interactions, initiating chains of indirect effects in the forest community. Using a combination of direct foraging observations, nutrient baiting, ant exclusion experiments, pitfall trapping, and isotopic analyses, the researchers will quantify the impacts of these biomass pulses on ant foraging at both the population and community levels. Within- and between-years comparisons will enable the team to gauge the impacts of cicada pulses on ant-mediated ecosystem functions, foraging dynamics, and ant-ant interactions. Specifically, the team will document the indirect effects that are likely to occur if shifts in foraging alter seed dispersal, scavenging, and protective services provided to aphids. Using stable isotopes to quantify the trophic position of ant foragers in both emergence and non-emergence years will allow the team to test whether ants initially occupying a range of trophic positions converge when fed a common diet. Moreover, these biomass pulses present a unique opportunity to examine the context-dependency of species interactions in both mutualistic and competitive settings. Taken together, these findings will contribute to the very limited literature describing the impacts of resource pulses on terrestrial invertebrates and provide important insights into how trophic ecology is altered during, and subsequent to, nutrient pulses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the fuzzy dark matter model has emerged as a promising candidate. In this model, the particles that make up dark matter are so light that they spread out over large areas, rather than clustering in small groups. This characteristic could help explain the size of our galaxy and why there seems to be a minimum size limit for galaxies in general. The project is driven by interests in high-energy physics, but it presents considerable experimental challenges. The research team plans to develop a new system designed to cast a wide net in the ongoing laboratory search for dark matter. The innovative techniques they create could not only help in the search for dark matter but also facilitate the discovery of new forces and enhance our ability to measure energy levels in quantum systems.<br/><br/>The research team will build a system to search for ultra-low mass dark matter by examining how it interacts with nuclear spins. Nuclear spin energy levels will fluctuate based on how they align with the flow of dark matter. As the Earth rotates and the dark matter oscillates, these energy levels will change, creating a unique pattern over time.<br/>The most precise measurements of the energy differences between quantum states?measured in absolute terms?have been achieved using groups of optically ?pumped? nuclear spins. This technique involves using light to control the orientation of a nucleus's spin, effectively aligning the nuclear spins in a specific direction through the manipulation of light.<br/>There is still significant potential to enhance energy sensitivity using current technology. The research team's goal is to achieve a 30-fold improvement over the current best methods, with data readout conducted by a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device).<br/><br/>The team will conduct two distinct dark matter searches: one targeting dark matter with a frequency higher than the Earth?s rotation rate, and another for dark matter with a mass lower than this rotation rate, that will include investigating the ?Fuzzy? dark matter scenario.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In M3D IC technology, the substrate layers are realized sequentially, and these layers are connected through metal inter-layer vias (MIVs). This project addresses significant challenges associated with the process technology for implementing M3D ICs to ensure reliable, compact and efficient designs. The project will facilitate further advances in M3D IC electronic design automation (EDA) methodology to efficiently address the potential challenges in M3D IC technology for full-scale chip designs. The proposed approaches to address the process-dependent challenges in M3D IC will provide future opportunities for M3D IC technology at all design levels ? device, circuit, and EDA.  The educational goals of this project are to (1) develop activities aiming from high-school students to graduate students that focus on hands-on learning such as  a custom lego-like toolkit that captures the EDA optimization problems of M3D ICs and, (2) IC tape-out activities along with emphasizing the need for energy-efficient and compact ICs. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a process-aware reliable and efficient EDA framework for M3D IC designs by addressing the following key concerns: (a) How significant is the impact of MIV on the performance of devices around it in bulk-substrate M3D IC process and how to reduce this impact for efficient and reliable M3D IC designs in this process technology? (b) How beneficial is the back-end-of-line transistor in the ultra-thin selective-substrate process and how to efficiently use this extra dimension for compact and efficient M3D IC designs in this process technology? and (c) How to obtain efficient M3D IC designs for heterogeneous integration considering both bulk-substrate and ultra-thin selective-substrate processes? The first concern will be addressed by developing a custom shielding mechanism based on the M3D IC process to nullify the MIV impact. The second concern will be addressed by developing the design rule-based custom physical design methodology specific to ultra-thin selective substrate process. The third concern will be addressed by combining the above two approaches based on the substrate layer process.

As a long-lived (perennial) crop, grapevines are typically cultivated as a clonally propagated stem (the scion) which is mechanically grafted to a genetically distinct, clonally propagated root (the rootstock). Because grapevines are cultivated as clones, individual plants of the same variety are essentially genetic twins. Thousands of clonal stem varieties are planted across the globe and exhibit large variation in growth, berry chemistry, and wine volatiles based on vineyard environmental conditions and management. This variation in growth and performance is known as phenotypic plasticity and impacts both fruit and wine characteristics, a phenomenon known culturally and commercially as ?terroir?, the signature of the local environment on the vine. Because of their clonal nature, one potential mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in grapevines is changes to the epigenome, a collective term for non-genetic DNA modifications that can change how specific genes and gene pathways are activated or deactivated. The goal of this project is to understand which portions of the grapevine genome are impacted by epigenetic changes, how epigenetic change in the root and the stem interact in grafted plants, and how these changes contribute to optimal plant resilience in response to environmental stress. These results will be used to help plant breeders identify the next generation of elite grapevine varieties and grape growers improve grapevine production across diverse growing regions. Integrated education and outreach include providing research training for project personnel in collaboration with industry partners across six states. In addition, project participants will be involved in outreach and hands-on research training activities that leverage existing programs and partnerships to maximize STEM participation of high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>How do long-lived plants (perennials) acclimate to different environments and what is the extent of phenotypic plasticity possible from a single genome? Grapevines are grown as a composite of a clonally propagated stem (the scion) mechanically grafted to a clonally propagated root (the rootstock).  These unique combinations of shoot and root are planted across diverse geographic regions around the world; consequently, grapevines offer a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of whole-plant, multi-year phenotypic plasticity and enables the experiment disentanglement of the shoot genotype x root genotype x environment interactions across diverse climatic conditions. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop an integrated understanding of how the genome of clonally propagated perennial plants produces ?adapted? phenotypes, from roots to shoots, over time and under different environmental conditions, and to identify the molecular basis of this phenotypic plasticity. This study will use experimental vineyards planted with a single scion cultivar ?Marquette? grafted to three commercial rootstock cultivars, replicated in three different environments (New York, Missouri, South Dakota). The project will use an integrative systems biology approach combining measures of plant physiology, leaf ionomics and metabolomics, fruit ionomics and metabolomics, wine chemistry analysis, and connections between sRNA, mRNA, and cytosine methylation signatures in shoots and roots across sites and their interaction with the spatial and temporal changes that occur in the epigenome in clonal shoots and roots.

While recent years have seen a blossoming of novel cryptographic techniques and applications, we still do not know if even our elementary cryptosystems are secure. Unlike most scientific domains, including much of computer science, it is impossible to empirically verify that a cryptosystem is secure. Instead, cryptographic security is founded on the conjectured existence of strong computational intractability: the inability of efficient algorithms to solve particular problems. The primary goal of this project is to strengthen the foundations of computational intractability needed for robust cryptography, which will yield a more robust cryptographic infrastructure. Another goal of this project is educational outreach, which will be presented through talks, tutorials, and lectures to encourage collaboration with diverse communities and, in turn, equip individuals with the ability to reason effectively about security.<br/><br/>We propose exploring novel resource-constrained adversarial models to improve our cryptographic foundations. Traditionally, cryptographic attackers were modeled as probabilistic polynomial time algorithms. To circumvent barriers in this traditional setting and strengthen cryptographic security, we consider adversarial models that are alternately more powerful (e.g., algorithms with limited nondeterminism) and less powerful (e.g., algorithms with fixed polynomial time/space). We highlight two concrete aims: (1) improved cryptographic hardness amplification, yielding extremely hard problems from hard problems, and (2) understanding the feasibility of cryptographic security if it turns out that traditional cryptographic guarantees are impossible, planting our security on a firmer footing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, the accuracy of computational and artificial intelligence (AI) methods used to predict new catalyst designs will be examined.  The outcomes of the research will be incorporated into a computational catalysis educational program for undergraduate and graduate students and integrated into two graduate courses currently taught by the principal investigator.<br/><br/>The project will build on the foundation developed during the lead investigator's decade-long work combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning (ML) methods. This foundation allows for the exploration of the catalytic properties of the ?29? oxide structure, a unique copper oxide film that can be stably grown on a Cu(111) crystal, enabling the development of systems that leverage this structure. This oxide acts as an ideal support for atomically dispersed precious metals, making it highly effective for catalysis. To design and evaluate the performance of atomically dispersed Pt and Rh atoms on the ""29"" oxide Cu support, the computational work will be conducted in collaboration with experimental partners. The structure and redox properties of the ""29"" oxide surface on Cu(111) will also be examined by focusing on dynamic changes (fluxionality) as it is reduced to the ""44"" oxide structure under reaction conditions. The ""29"" and ""44"" refer to the unit cell size of each oxide structure. A key goal of the study is to reconcile previous models of the ""29"" and ""44"" oxide surfaces with recent non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) images, which show two distinct stoichiometric arrangements for these structures, as reported in a recent publication (Zhu et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 146 (2024), 15887?15896).

The tendency for policymakers to favor reactive solutions while neglecting proactive preventative efforts is perhaps most evident in the context of natural disasters. The benefits of investment in risk reduction can be intangible, particularly if it avoids a disaster, but the mobilization of aid to communities experiencing a natural disaster provides visible outcomes. This illustrates a broader public policy-behavioral dilemma called The Intangibility of Public Policy. The implication is that intangibility of outcomes will cause people to undervalue risk reduction investments and policies, which will lead to excessive levels of public risk.<br/><br/>The project involves a survey experiment that leverages wildfire exposure and forest management to investigate the behavioral implications of the intangibility of wildfire risk reduction. Using secondary data, the researchers identify wildfire relevant locations (zip codes) that were exposed and not exposed to a Type 1/severe wildfire in 2024 and that had hazardous fuels forest thinning in the previous two-year period (pre-thinning) or are planned to have thinning in the subsequent two-year periods (post-thinning). Across the wildfire and management conditions, the survey experiment considers (i) how people perceive the reduction in wildfire risk from previous and planned forest thinning, (ii) people?s preferences for the allocation of wildfire risk reduction investment between prevention and suppression activities, and (iii) people?s willingness to take individual action to reduce wildfire risks. Comparisons across exposure and management conditions provide insights to how people perceive, respond, and support risk reduction following a disaster.

The details of how these surfaces evolve as rocks fail hold information to better understand future events and to assess hazards. It is impossible to observe these interfaces in nature. The most informative measurements come from sensors placed at the surface. The goal of this proposal is to instead observe an experimental system to determine how interfaces slip and evolve. The experiments listen to ice slip experiments with sensors to study how the faults evolve, and how changes may affect seismic hazards. The project will support a graduate student and a collaboration across three institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to understand how the evolution of contacts during cycles of shear, slip, and stability control large scale behaviors in both faults and glacial systems. This will be accomplished by directly observing the coupled processes that control nucleation, slow and fast slip, healing, drag, and melting in ice to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the evolution of conditionally unstable frictional interfaces. A series of both static and sliding experiments will be performed using a custom cryogenic biaxial apparatus and a sample of ice atop a glass plate. Ice will be used for two key reasons: 1) it is transparent, allowing light and images to be transmitted through it; and 2) it has a low melting temperature, such that exploring a modest range of temperature covers a broad swath of homologous temperature, T/Tm, and thus both brittle and ductile behavior. This knowledge, analyzed by cutting-edge machine learning data analysis methods and extrapolated up to larger systems, will improve understanding of the mechanics of the entire stick-slip cycle and stability.

Due to the limited geographic extent of scientific surveys, countless cryptobenthic fish species have yet to be discovered and described, and local biodiversity inventories do not exist in most countries. This project explores the biodiversity of cryptobenthic coral reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific by:  1) conducting a series of local and regional inventories through standardized survey and collection protocols, 2) describing new species by considering multiple high-resolution sources of information to delineate closely related species, 3) analyzing the evolutionary diversification of a particularly species-rich lineage (the dwarf goby genus Eviota) and 4) training a new generation of fish taxonomists with strong ties to coral reef nations to ensure reef fish biodiversity research and conservation for years to come. <br/><br/>Inventorying the diversity of life on our planet is a critical challenge that intensifies with the rapid change of the biosphere.

The ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 (13C/12C) in petroleum is very different from that ratio in seawater.  One of the most sensitive ways we have of finding petroleum-based carbon in the ocean is by looking for changes in 13C/12C of carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater.  Unfortunately, this is seldom done because 13C/12C measurements are expensive and not regularly done at sea. In this project, the 13C/12C ratio of ocean carbon dioxide will be measured in the Pacific and Indian Oceans using a new instrument that is much less expensive to run and can run many more samples than previous methods.  The new measurements will be compared to old ones in order to estimate how much man-made carbon dioxide has entered the ocean.  In coming decades changes in ocean behavior should be detectable by comparison with the data collected in this project.<br/><br/>PIs have developed a seagoing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) extraction system coupled with a laser spectrometer that can be deployed at sea.

When these nutritional ?pulses? occur, they can initiate chain reactions in food webs, as consumers switch from their normal diets to feast instead on the abundant new food items. Understanding the consequences of these food pulses for natural communities ? which organisms are affected, for how long, and if they stop performing their normal ?jobs? to take advantage of the new resource ? can provide insights into how ecological systems function and respond to change. The synchronized emergence of billions of periodical cicadas every 13 or 17 years in the eastern U.S. provides an enormous pulse of insect food for a variety of generalist consumers. The assembled research team will be the first to document the impacts of cicada pulses on the foraging behaviors and population dynamics of one of the most abundant animals on the planet: ants. Results of the study will advance our understanding of how nutrient pulses alter the varied ecosystem services that ants routinely provide, many of which are relevant for both the forestry and agriculture sectors. In addition to training undergraduate researchers in field biology, the research team has created a free digital education program, ?Friend to Cicadas,? the goal of which is to train and empower teachers throughout the entire range of periodical cicadas to provide activities that spark wonder and curiosity in their students.<br/><br/><br/>In this study, the researchers test the hypothesis that most ants will opportunistically adjust their foraging to capitalize on abundant cicada prey, both during the dramatic spring emergence and again when the next generation of cicadas hatches later in the summer.

The proposed laser power beaming innovation plays a pivotal role in establishing a power grid for remote provisioning of energy to devices. The proposed work is important for several industry verticals where physical wiring may not be a practical solution for continuous and clean power supply. The electric aircraft market has an immediate need for an alternative charging solution. Battery longevity remains a critical bottleneck in the drone industry, causing disruptions in usage and operational efficiency due to frequent and mandatory recharging procedures. This work targets expansion of battery capabilities through a far-field wireless charging solution which directly addresses the unmet needs of drone manufacturers and operators alike and allows for longer operational periods, greater flexibility in device usage, and increased performance capabilities. This project stands to contribute to the fields of photonics, semiconductor technology, and energy harvesting, providing a novel solution to a longstanding challenge in the electrical aircraft market through the advancement and application of wireless power transfer. The proposed innovation serves to drive innovation in the energy efficiency technologies, which are critical to national energy independence and technological leadership. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to enhance the overall power conversion efficiency for wireless power transmission systems through the development of a highly efficient photovoltaic power converter. The proposed innovation is built on the concept of a one-way coherent absorber with inverse-designed aperiodic multilayer front- and back-reflectors that enable maximal optical absorption in a thin-film photovoltaic material for broad incident angles. Innovative design configurations and high-quality fabrication through molecular beam epitaxy will be employed to construct the device based on optimized multilayer binary mirrors, thus aiming to reach record-high external quantum efficiency by efficiently trapping monochromatic light for an oblique angular range. The proposed photovoltaic receiver, responsible for absorbing laser fluence and converting it to electrical energy, will realize substantial progress in power conversion efficiency for far-field power transmission. This approach, which integrates advanced optical and electrical characterization methods, promises to deepen the understanding of light-matter interactions at the atomic scale and has the potential to unlock new avenues for high-efficiency, scalable wireless power systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When these nutritional ?pulses? occur, they can initiate chain reactions in food webs, as consumers switch from their normal diets to feast instead on the abundant new food items. Understanding the consequences of these food pulses for natural communities ? which organisms are affected, for how long, and if they stop performing their normal ?jobs? to take advantage of the new resource ? can provide insights into how ecological systems function and respond to change. The synchronized emergence of billions of periodical cicadas every 13 or 17 years in the eastern U.S. provides an enormous pulse of insect food for a variety of generalist consumers. The assembled research team will be the first to document the impacts of cicada pulses on the foraging behaviors and population dynamics of one of the most abundant animals on the planet: ants. Results of the study will advance our understanding of how nutrient pulses alter the varied ecosystem services that ants routinely provide, many of which are relevant for both the forestry and agriculture sectors. In addition to training undergraduate researchers in field biology, the research team has created a free digital education program, ?Friend to Cicadas,? the goal of which is to train and empower teachers throughout the entire range of periodical cicadas to provide activities that spark wonder and curiosity in their students.<br/><br/><br/>In this study, the researchers test the hypothesis that most ants will opportunistically adjust their foraging to capitalize on abundant cicada prey, both during the dramatic spring emergence and again when the next generation of cicadas hatches later in the summer. Further, they predict that changes in ant foraging will alter the strength of their competitive and mutualistic interactions, initiating chains of indirect effects in the forest community.

The goals this effort are to sample and speciate air pollutants emitted from the fires and quantify the contribution of structure fires to concentrations and impacts of hazardous air pollutants in the densely populated megacity of Los Angeles. The knowledge gained from this work will inform disaster response policy (risk assessment, hazard control), ecosystem health risks, prediction of human health risks, and recovery efforts in the wake of a growing national hazard: catastrophic urban fires.<br/><br/>The presence of advanced polymer materials (e.g., in carpets, flooring, clothing, appliances, housewares) and metals (e.g., in electronics, appliances, vehicles, fasteners) suggests that the content of urban fire emissions should be complex and potentially more toxic than emissions from traditional biomass burning events. Analysis of field data suggest that structure fires in WUI regions might produce severe exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated compounds (e.g., PFAS), dioxins, furans, and transition metals, orders of magnitude larger than the exposure from wildfire emissions. Working with leadership and staff at the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), the proposal team has deployed a small network of AirPen and UPAS systems at existing air quality monitoring stations as close as possible to the existing fires in the northern Los Angeles region. This air quality sampling is expected to last for four weeks but may be adjusted to include additional sites or sampling equipment in the future depending on the nature of the fires. Other region-specific data streams: criteria pollutants measured at SCAQMD air quality monitoring stations, fire activity, and remote sensing (e.g., satellite) and weather (e.g., reanalysis, back trajectory) data will supplement the interpretation of the chemical data.<br/><br/>Ash is expected to persist in the region for weeks-to-months following this event and ash samples will be collected from within the burn areas and from fugitive emission events (i.e., windblown dust) and analyzed. The ash samples are likely to contain a different mixture of toxic species (relative to the smoke), and ash exposure will remain a major human and environmental hazard for first responders, cleanup crews, homeowners, and members of the surrounding community. This effort will demonstrate how structure fires and specific structural fuels have the potential to modulate the environmental and health impacts from WUI fires.<br/><br/>Training for both a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar will be supported through the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This protein influences the synthesis of the pilus, which is a structure on the surface of bacteria that is used to attach the bacterium to substrates. Pili facilitate bacterial colonization and sometimes biofilm formation. This project will probe how this protein functions, and will provide the foundation for future approaches to manipulate this protein within biomedical and agricultural contexts. This project also will be integrated into an educational component designed to train cadres of future scientists.

As a long-lived (perennial) crop, grapevines are typically cultivated as a clonally propagated stem (the scion) which is mechanically grafted to a genetically distinct, clonally propagated root (the rootstock). Because grapevines are cultivated as clones, individual plants of the same variety are essentially genetic twins. Thousands of clonal stem varieties are planted across the globe and exhibit large variation in growth, berry chemistry, and wine volatiles based on vineyard environmental conditions and management. This variation in growth and performance is known as phenotypic plasticity and impacts both fruit and wine characteristics, a phenomenon known culturally and commercially as ?terroir?, the signature of the local environment on the vine. Because of their clonal nature, one potential mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in grapevines is changes to the epigenome, a collective term for non-genetic DNA modifications that can change how specific genes and gene pathways are activated or deactivated. The goal of this project is to understand which portions of the grapevine genome are impacted by epigenetic changes, how epigenetic change in the root and the stem interact in grafted plants, and how these changes contribute to optimal plant resilience in response to environmental stress. These results will be used to help plant breeders identify the next generation of elite grapevine varieties and grape growers improve grapevine production across diverse growing regions. Integrated education and outreach include providing research training for project personnel in collaboration with industry partners across six states. In addition, project participants will be involved in outreach and hands-on research training activities that leverage existing programs and partnerships to maximize STEM participation of high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>How do long-lived plants (perennials) acclimate to different environments and what is the extent of phenotypic plasticity possible from a single genome? Grapevines are grown as a composite of a clonally propagated stem (the scion) mechanically grafted to a clonally propagated root (the rootstock).  These unique combinations of shoot and root are planted across diverse geographic regions around the world; consequently, grapevines offer a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of whole-plant, multi-year phenotypic plasticity and enables the experiment disentanglement of the shoot genotype x root genotype x environment interactions across diverse climatic conditions. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop an integrated understanding of how the genome of clonally propagated perennial plants produces ?adapted? phenotypes, from roots to shoots, over time and under different environmental conditions, and to identify the molecular basis of this phenotypic plasticity. This study will use experimental vineyards planted with a single scion cultivar ?Marquette? grafted to three commercial rootstock cultivars, replicated in three different environments (New York, Missouri, South Dakota). The project will use an integrative systems biology approach combining measures of plant physiology, leaf ionomics and metabolomics, fruit ionomics and metabolomics, wine chemistry analysis, and connections between sRNA, mRNA, and cytosine methylation signatures in shoots and roots across sites and their interaction with the spatial and temporal changes that occur in the epigenome in clonal shoots and roots.

The NENIMF SIMS measures the concentration and isotopic composition of light elements (hydrogen, lithium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen). It supports research in two areas relevant to society, volcanoes and climate change. The SIMS can study the volatiles (dissolved gasses) found in magmas and examine climate signals in biogenic carbonates. The NENIMF trains and assists users with performing analyses. Fifty-six scientists from 32 institutions used the NENIMF from 2022 to 2024, and over the last three decades NENIMF instrumentation has supported almost 400 studies.<br/><br/>The NENIMF uses a Cameca IMS 1280 double focusing mass spectrometer with a large radius magnetic sector (585 mm) and ion optics optimized to attain a mass resolving power (MRP=M/?M) of 6,000 without significant loss of secondary ion intensity. The IMS 1280 was recently upgraded with NSF support from single to multicollection with enhanced UV imaging capabilities. In addition to the specialized microanalytical capabilities of the NENIMF, SIMS users are investigating B isotopes in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt glasses and subduction zone minerals, Zr in rutile geospeedometry, Ti diffusion in quartz, and U-Th-Pb dating of monazite and zircon. New analytical protocols recently developed at the NENIMF include measuring the concentrations of low abundance volatile elements in nominally anhydrous minerals, characterization of the isotopic composition of B at very low concentrations, measurement of volatiles in very small (< 10 m diameter) melt inclusions, and development of isotope and concentration reference materials. The NENIMF emphasizes student learning and training of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. It will continue to involve WHOI?s Undergraduate Summer Student Fellows, Post-doctoral Scholars, and WHOI/MIT Joint Program graduate students in SIMS-focused research projects. The NENIMF will run annual workshops to engage young scientists in SIMS-based research focused on magma volatiles, and it will conduct community outreach at scientific meetings.

One regulatory mechanism that is used in nature is to poise the protein machines that access genetic information at the start of genes, waiting to initiate the process of converting the encoded information into molecules that execute cellular functions. Chemical modifications of these ready-to-go proteins exert timely control over cellular responses to stimuli by dictating the efficiency with which genes are activated. For this project, the investigator will push the boundaries of current technologies to explore the structural responses to chemical modifications that trigger release from pausing and entry into efficient decoding of genetic information. This program addresses a significant gap in our knowledge of how gene expression is regulated. This program will train junior scientists at multiple education levels to seek fundamental insight into the systems and processes from biochemistry, using the principles and quantitative laws from the physical sciences. Among other outreach efforts, the investigator will bring undergraduate students from different schools to Penn State for research opportunities that will enhance their career potential in science and engineering fields. <br/><br/>To achieve this project?s objectives, new experimental methodology will be implemented for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of highly flexible proteins. While protons are relatively easy to observe by NMR, the PI has shown that the comparatively more challenging direct-detection of carbon yields more quantitative and complete information for intrinsically disordered polypeptides. Recently, the PI used this technique to demonstrate how serine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II provides a structural switch that plays a role in regulating the critically important enzyme. RNA Polymerase II pauses at the start of genes before entering into productive elongation and these phosphorylation events are associated with release from the paused state. The PI will now broaden the characterization of pause release by investigating threonine phosphorylation on a required co-regulator of RNA polymerase II, named the DSIF complex, which is a second necessary step for pause release. The phosphorylation patterns on RNA Polymerase II change throughout the process of RNA elongation, so this project will extend characterization of serine phosphorylation to model each of the relevant states in an RNA production cycle. Finally, lysine amino acids in a specific region of RNA polymerase II also acquire methyl groups while the enzyme is active on a subset of genes. These modifications can exert combinatorial control with the previously characterized phosphorylation. Therefore, experiments will be performed to test the hypothesis that addition of methyl groups to the amino acid lysine also induces structural transitions, akin to those the PI has observed in association with phosphate incorporation. As a result, this research and associated training activities will yield fundamental, molecular level insights that provide critical molecular insights into gene regulation.

It deploys commonly used ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection technology in a simple pitcher-shaped, countertop, household appliance. It operates using electricity when available but can also be powered by a rechargeable battery. Anyone can safely operate it to produce all the drinking water needed after a city?s water treatment or distribution systems are damaged by a flood or earthquake or other natural disaster. Thus, the product can have significant value in addressing the U.S. incident and emergency management challenges. Microbiologically contaminated drinking water contributes to more than 500,000 deaths annually. Globally, about a billion people boil their water every day to make sure it is safe. The proposed product can meet their needs more safely while meaningfully reducing carbon emissions. This project is also in alignment with the 2022 U.S. Global Water Strategy that calls for increased water security where it is needed most.<br/> <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will focus on the design of an instrumented UV appliance. This will be aided by light transmission modeling in non-cylindrical vessels to assure uniform and adequate exposure of water to the UV light and appropriately locating UV-C LED lamps and UV transmittance monitors to achieve those goals. The device will be experimentally tested with controlled microbial challenges with the goal of demonstrating that the appliance conforms to World Health Organization?s standards for household water treatment technologies for a broad array of contaminated water sources. It is thought that discrete UV intensity monitoring can be correlated with UV-C dose so that performance can be adjusted for water with varying levels of microbial contamination. The appliance will also incorporate sensor capabilities to automatically log, and report use data to support the potential compilation of carbon credits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Achilles heel of QIP has been dissipation, the friction that both generates heat and destroys the long-lived quantum correlations among quantum bits (""qubits"") necessary for QIP, so far limiting quantum information systems in both size and complexity.  Such correlations among qubits are called ""entanglement,"" and a goal of this research is to produce any desired entangled state of qubits, which becomes the starting point for a quantum computation.<br/><br/>A powerful approach to address this general problem is quantum reservoir engineering: the idea is to turn the tables on dissipation and use it as a resource for steering a quantum system, such that the dissipation-driven dynamics naturally relax the system to the state of interest.  This CAREER project supports basic research into developing a novel reservoir engineering framework and leverages it for entanglement generation in noisy quantum systems.  From a practical standpoint, this will help identify critical milestones for establishing reservoir engineering as a standard paradigm for scalable and robust entanglement generation, which has applications in all areas of quantum information science, including quantum computing, sensing and communication.  In addition, the proposed research will enable fundamental advances in the physics of quantum systems coupled to a noisy environment by developing theoretical tools to rigorously explore the validity of standard dissipative models in the presence of noise that varies, and is correlated, in time.<br/><br/>The education and training aspect in this project will assume a multi-pronged approach that will expose graduate and undergraduate students to a wide variety of analytical and computational techniques in quantum information and quantum optics.  Aided and informed by close connections with experimental realizations of solid-state qubits, the aim will be to provide the trainees a holistic view of the polyglot field of QIP and address the strategic national need to create a ""quantum-smart"" workforce.  The training aspect will be integrated with broad educational and outreach goals via new and continuing curriculum and course development initiatives, public talks, and promoting open access venues for communicating research results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Quantum reservoir engineering is an attractive approach for correcting errors and realizing stable quantum coherences autonomously.  The basic idea is to tailor the dissipative environment of the target systems so that this engineered dissipation relaxes the system to and sustains it in a desired target state.  While versatile, existing schemes for dissipative state preparation rely exclusively on time-independent dissipative dynamics, which can leave the protocols susceptible to unwanted spurious dissipation.  The PI's broad vision is that this project will enable a transformative new class of dissipative state preparation protocols with dramatically improved speed, fidelity and robustness to errors.  To this end, the research will broadly focus on two directions: (i) study of dynamics driven by time-dependent dissipation, and (ii) study of dynamics driven by correlated dissipation.  These theoretical studies will involve developing a comprehensive analytical and numerical framework with some of the first explorations of the validity of open quantum systems descriptions, especially in a context where non-trivial dissipation is a useful resource.  For instance, the outcomes of this project will address fundamental questions pertaining to implications of adiabaticity and non-Markovianity for reservoir engineering and provide useful pointers for quantum error correction and error mitigation in the presence of correlated noise.  This has transformative potential not only for the entanglement stabilization protocols envisioned here but also for any platform involving dynamic control of quantum systems.  The PI maintains an active collaboration with experimental groups who will test the ideas on Josephson-junction-based superconducting platforms.  Thus this research will complement and advance the rapidly growing experimental capabilities in quantum control of low-dimensional open systems in the near-term.  Further, it will help strengthen interdisciplinary connections between disparate fields of quantum information/quantum optics, optimal control and strongly-interacting field theories, all of which focus on far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, it is an uncomfortable and damaging process?causing pain, tissue damage, infection, scarring, and leakage. Hydrogel bioadhesives have thus emerged, aiming to replace sutures. Since their first development over a half-century ago, they have substantially benefitted surgeries in many ways, such as simplified procedures, short operation time, less discomfort, and reduced post-surgery complications. Hydrogel bioadhesives are soft, wet, and biocompatible and used just like common glues or duct tape. Existing hydrogel bioadhesives are mostly designed for emergency applications such as wound closure and sealing. However, when prolonged adhesion is required, typically in long-term implantation, they are unfit, owing to mechanical mismatch with target tissues and unstable adhesion in the physiological environment. The mechanical mismatch constrains natural tissue movement to cause damage, insufficiently supports tissue physiological functions, and alters the local cell microenvironment to induce abnormal cellular behaviors. Unstable adhesion leads to premature adhesion failure. To address these challenges, this project develops a class of bioadhesive implants by modular design. The bioadhesive implants integrate a liquid adhesive layer and a solid hydrogel layer, where the former provides fast, stable, and strong adhesion between the target tissue and the hydrogel layer, and the latter provides tissue-specific mechanical compliance. This project supports the fundamental research to determine the optimal formulation of bioadhesive implants, investigate adhesion kinetics and properties under various operation conditions as well as long-term adhesion behaviors under fatigue mechanical loads, and elucidate relations between adhesion supramolecular processes and adhesion behaviors. These findings expand the knowledge of bioadhesive design, principles, and mechanisms, and advance various implantable therapies such as bioelectronic medicine, regenerative medicine, and on-target drug delivery. This project also highlights the broader impacts on education and outreach by engaging grades 4-12 and undergraduate students to learn the basics of hydrogels, perform the hands-on making of hydrogels, and participate in hydrogel and bioadhesive research, and by broadly disseminating this research to the general public to increase their awareness of hydrogel bioadhesive technologies and amplify the scientific and societal impacts.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>This project develops a class of bioadhesive implants by modular design, which integrates a liquid adhesive polymer layer and a solid tissue-elasticity-matching hydrogel layer. The bioadhesion is realized by penetrating adhesive polymers into the target tissue and the hydrogel layer and then gelating inside them to form a new polymer network, connecting them through topological entanglements. The polymer gelation kinetics can be tuned to enable fast adhesion and the topological entanglements create deep adhesion to allow strong and stable adhesion. The bioadhesion does not require functional groups from hydrogels, thus broadening the choices of hydrogels (including chemically inert hydrogels) to be used to match the elasticity of diverse biological tissues. The research objectives are (i) design, formulate, and characterize bioadhesive implants, (ii) investigation of complex adhesion behaviors ex vivo, and (iii) mechanistic understanding of linking supramolecular processes to adhesion. To obtain the optimal formulation and guide the practical use of bioadhesive implants, experimental studies will be performed to evaluate adhesion energy, adhesion kinetics, adhesion behaviors associated with adhesive thicknesses, penetration depths, material properties of tissues and hydrogels, and fatigue loading, as well as biocompatibility. To fundamentally understand the adhesion mechanism, theoretical modeling will be established to elucidate the critical supramolecular process of diffusion and gelation of adhesive polymers on the effective development of bioadhesion and how they are influenced by the material properties of hydrogels and tissues. This research also offers an important and emerging topic for educational and outreach activities on hydrogels and bioadhesives and facilitates clinical collaboration and translation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the oceans must maintain a balance between alkalinity supplied by continental weathering, and alkalinity removed by calcium carbonate burial, at least over long time periods, a reduction in the burial of calcium carbonate on continental shelves would induce an increase in the carbonate ion concentration of seawater to preserve more calcium carbonate in deep sea sediments. If seawater had a greater carbonate ion concentration than today, then it would absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the exact mechanism(s) responsible for this CO2 variability remain(s) to be determined. To address this key knowledge gap, the investigators seek to test a method for estimating the carbonate ion concentration of seawater in the past. Existing methods for estimating carbonate ion concentration are labor-intensive and expensive. This proposal aims to test a method that would be much faster and much less expensive. The scientific goal is to combine estimates of carbonate ion concentration from marine sediments with the other geologic evidence to determine the relative importance of biological processes and of changes in sea level as factors that contributed to lower atmospheric CO2 concentration during glacial intervals.  Broader impacts activities include training, mentoring, and the involving undergraduate students in research, community outreach events, and workforce development.<br/><br/>The investigators plan to advance the calibration of an existing proxy for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution, and to determine if the proxy also provides reliable estimates of bottom water carbonate ion concentration. Calcium carbonate dissolution in the deep sea is sensitive to changes in bottom water undersaturation (expressed as Delta [CO32-]), so a proxy method for CaCO3 dissolution (Globorotalia menardii Fragmentation Index ? MFI), if rigorously calibrated, should provide a measure of bottom water Delta [CO32-].  The MFI method is rapid, inexpensive, only requires a microscope, and is suited to the involvement of undergraduate students in research on the global carbon cycle. The immediate goal is to determine if the MFI method can be used to provide a reliable measure of Delta [CO32-] through a 3-pronged calibration effort with previously collected samples: (1) Determine the MFI across a range of water depths in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, where Delta [CO32-] and the rate of CaCO3 dissolution have been measured independently; (2) conduct a global survey, including the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, to compare MFI against climatological Delta [CO32-] to assess potential regional variability in the relationship between Delta [CO32-] and MFI; and (3) determine the MFI from marine sediments from the Central Equatorial Pacific, covering the last 160,000 years, in two cores where Delta [CO32-] has already been measured using B/Ca ratios in epibenthic foraminifera.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project focuses on three types of PDEs: reaction-diffusion equations, Hele-Shaw type flows, and chemotaxis systems. These equations capture the evolution of diffusive processes, such as tumor growth, forest fire propagation, chemical diffusion, and crowd motion. The project aims to advance understanding of these equations and their underlying phenomena, with potential societal benefits such as enhanced strategies for managing forest fires and improving understanding of biological processes, including tumor cell behavior. The educational component is a cornerstone of this project, tightly integrated with its research objectives. In collaboration with Auburn University?s outreach programs, the Principal Investigator will engage K-12 students in interactive workshops and science fairs, inspiring curiosity and enthusiasm for science. A key focus of the educational efforts is increasing participation and retention of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics and science. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and early-career researchers through workshops and summer schools directly tied to the research themes. These programs will offer hands-on experiences, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications to prepare the next generation of scientists and mathematicians. This project integrates innovative research with impactful education and outreach, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and learning for the benefit of society.<br/><br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion equations are central to modeling phenomena such as front propagation and interface motion in fields like chemical kinetics, combustion, and population genetics. In sufficiently random media, the long-term, large-scale dynamics of these equations are expected to converge to a deterministic propagation process (called stochastic homogenization). While previous research in the area in general dimensions is limited, this proposed research brings new methods and technical tools to study such problems. For example, it will extend several fundamental probability tools that were widely used in PDE problems, including Kingman's subadditive theorem and Azuma's lemma. Furthermore, the methodologies developed here will have applications to other equations. Hele-Shaw flows with source and advection terms are widely used to model tumor growth, where the region occupied by tumor cells corresponds to the positive set of the solution, and the boundary of this region forms the free boundary. The presence of drift and source terms brings significant difficulties and so there are few results in this direction. This project focuses on developing new PDE techniques to address the regularity and the homogenization of the free boundary. The outcomes are expected to provide a deeper understanding of free boundary dynamics and illuminate the effects of stochastic fluctuations on interface motion. Chemotaxis, the directed movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients, is a crucial phenomenon in biology. While chemotaxis models have been extensively studied, most work focuses on bounded domains. This project aims to first establish the global well-posedness of chemotaxis systems on unbounded domains and then investigate the asymptotic spreading properties of solutions, a key characteristic of these systems. These studies will employ tools from various areas of mathematics, including semigroup theory, viscosity solutions and parabolic regularity theory, to explore new aspects of chemotaxis models, with potential contributions to both mathematics and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The details of how these surfaces evolve as rocks fail hold information to better understand future events and to assess hazards. It is impossible to observe these interfaces in nature. The most informative measurements come from sensors placed at the surface. The goal of this proposal is to instead observe an experimental system to determine how interfaces slip and evolve. The experiments listen to ice slip experiments with sensors to study how the faults evolve, and how changes may affect seismic hazards. The project will support a graduate student and a collaboration across three institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to understand how the evolution of contacts during cycles of shear, slip, and stability control large scale behaviors in both faults and glacial systems.

A series of both static and sliding experiments will be performed using a custom cryogenic biaxial apparatus and a sample of ice atop a glass plate. Ice will be used for two key reasons: 1) it is transparent, allowing light and images to be transmitted through it; and 2) it has a low melting temperature, such that exploring a modest range of temperature covers a broad swath of homologous temperature, T/Tm, and thus both brittle and ductile behavior.

There exist major gaps in our understanding of RNA modifications, including which RNA molecules are modified and at what sites, which enzymes mediate modification, and how modifications affect RNA function. This project seeks to address these knowledge gaps for the RNA modification dihydrouridine (D), which is one of the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved modifications in biology, through the application of innovative approaches integrating chemical and biological disciplines. The project will also provide unique training opportunities for students at the chemical biology interface and facilitate education and outreach aimed at increasing engagement with nucleic acid chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>The research is focused on the study of dihydrouridine (D), an abundant modification (mod) on transfer RNA (tRNA). D is installed by dihydrouridine synthases (DUS) and is commonly found in the eponymous tRNA D-loop as well as in the variable loop in eukaryotes. The function of D mods in tRNA biology and cellular/organismal processes is largely unknown. This is largely due to the lack of efficient tools to characterize D sites and DUS enzymes (writers), as well as related tRNA mods, and the paucity of targeted functional studies integrating biochemical effects with biological phenotypes. The long-term goal of this project is to characterize D mods and writer enzymes and elucidate their biological role through the application of chemical biology methods in combination with biochemical studies, high-throughput transcriptomic analyses, and cell biological assays. In Aim 1 is to study the biochemistry and structural biology of DUS proteins; Aim 2 is to characterize D mods with chemical sequencing technology and mass spectrometry; and Aim 3 is to study the role of D in tRNA stability and protein translation. Taken together, this research will reveal insights into the regulation of RNA structure and function through enzymatic modification and its role in gene expression regulation.

During space weather events, heating of the atmosphere can cause it to expand to higher altitude, causing dramatic and sudden increases in atmospheric drag. There are examples of satellites which have re-entered the atmosphere prematurely because of this increased drag. There are relatively few direct measurements of the atmospheric density at these altitudes to use to improve models, but the satellite navigation data (e.g. from GPS), can be used to detect the minute changes in orbits caused by this drag, which can be inverted to determine atmospheric density. These observations can in turn be used to improve atmospheric models. In this project we will develop the necessary tools and models to obtain atmospheric density from navigation data, and apply them to actual satellite orbit data. In the future such tools can be applied on a large scale to the navigation data of thousands of orbiting satellites to develop more accurate atmospheric models which will help all satellite operators to keep satellites operating safely.<br/><br/>The proposal aims to develop data assimilation algorithms that will enable estimation of the atmospheric drag on satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) based on their low-resolution Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigation data. Drag is defined as a loss of total energy of the satellite due to the atmosphere only. After the effect of solar radiation pressure (which is vectorized and can both decrease and increase total energy), it is possible to determine the atmospheric mass density with appropriately calibrated drag coefficients. The data assimilation algorithms to determine drag consist of a Kalman filter approach wrapped around an orbit propagator which incorporates a high-resolution gravitational field model, taking as input the low-resolution GNSS navigation data of the satellites. This study will identify the methods for separating radiation pressure and atmospheric drag depending on orbital location and satellite orientation. In the future, these algorithms and methodologies can be used to produce a large database of atmospheric densities which can be incorporated into whole atmosphere data assimilation models for nowcasting and forecasting atmospheric density. The methods and algorithms can also be developed further to form the basis for on-board algorithms for satellites to autonomously take evasive action. Existing tools for atmospheric drag measurements are largely proprietary. The tools developed through this effort will be made publicly available, expanding access to cutting-edge research capabilities and supporting scientific innovation across the academic community.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Aeronomy and EMBRACE programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behavior of large objects, such as the earth or the galaxy, is well described by Einstein?s theory of gravity. However, these two descriptions of our universe do not appear to be fully compatible, and a challenge of contemporary physics is to find a way to bridge this seeming incompatibility. One difficulty with doing this is the fact that the gravitational force between atomic-scale objects is too weak to measure. To overcome this problem, the PI and his students are planning to perform experiments on centimeter-scale objects, which have significant gravitational interactions, with a precision that approaches the limits allowed by quantum mechanics. Additionally, the PI will author a textbook that uses an inter-disciplinary approach to the theory and practice of realistic quantum measurements. This textbook will help train the next generation of quantum engineers.<br/><br/>The research program will extend recently demonstrated techniques to fabricate multi-centimeter-scale, mass-loaded, high-stressed torsional suspensions with mechanical quality factors of at least 100 million. The angular displacement of such a torsional oscillator will be measured and controlled in a quantum-noise-limited manner. The torsional pendulum will be used as a ?probe mass? to detect the gravitational force of a driven, milligram-scale ?source mass?.

The extant literature on field learning and research suggests that fieldwork is an important component for building effective CoPs, promotes the application of theoretical knowledge, and helps novice learners build community identity. However, employing the CoP framework to empirically identify best-practices and necessary skills to ensure effective participation to promote success among interdisciplinary teams to achieve common research goals has not been attempted before. Addressing this broad question is beyond the scope of a single research project. Therefore, researchers will begin by collecting empirical baseline data to demonstrate how interdisciplinary field-based CoPs develop during fieldwork and document the effectiveness of the CoP framework in promoting successful interdisciplinary research goals. The proposed work will use mixed-methods involving a combination of observations, focus group interviews, and surveys (pre-and-post) to evaluate how fieldwork fosters the development of CoPs, and how four elements of the CoP framework including coordination (hierarchical vs whole group), communication (visual, written, verbal, online, in person), mentoring, and shared leadership (differences between novice and expert decision making) influence the effectiveness of interdisciplinary learning environments across the novice to expert spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This property called cell polarity is essential for proper cellular function and is achieved by segregating specific proteins to either region of the cells. This research investigates fundamental mechanisms that enable cells to establish and maintain polarity, processes essential for proper development and tissue function. Precisely, the project focuses on understanding how cells sort and transport proteins to specific regions using molecular machinery called clathrin and its associated proteins. This international collaborative project will involve using a variety of approaches to provide a mechanistic understanding of a process that is important to virtually all multicellular organisms. The Broader Impacts of this work include engaging high school students and their teachers through the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET) at the University of Florida. Undergraduates and a post-doctoral researcher will also be involved in the project. These initiatives will provide students with exposure to cutting-edge microscopy techniques and cell biology research with the ultimate goal to inspire them to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). <br/><br/>The research employs state-of-the-art microscopy, genetic engineering, and biochemical approaches to understand how the clathrin machinery drives the polarized sorting of specific cellular proteins to either the apical or basolateral side of polarized epithelial cells. The project will investigate how protein sorting in epithelial cell takes place at newly discovered apical tubular compartments characterized by the small GTPase ARF1 decorated by nano-domains of clathrin light chains (CLCs) and the adaptor protein 1 (AP-1). Through a combination of advanced gene editing techniques, mass spectrometry analysis, and super-resolution microscopy, the research team will map the molecular interactions that enable directional protein transport and identify new regulatory proteins involved in this process. The project introduces innovative approaches including proximity-based proteomics and live-cell imaging using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to dissect the temporal sequence of sorting events, as well as novel protein degradation systems (PROTAC) that allows rapid and selective removal of specific cellular components to determine their precise roles in sorting processes. This work will establish how cells achieve precise spatial organization of proteins through the coordinated action of molecular sorting machinery, revealing fundamental principles of cellular organization.

This team proposes to use the community of practice (CoP) framework where groups of people that share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting in an ongoing basis, to study collaboration and learning during a field data collection activity as part of an 8-day field deployment involving many scientists representing different sub-disciplines and levels of expertise. The extant literature on field learning and research suggests that fieldwork is an important component for building effective CoPs, promotes the application of theoretical knowledge, and helps novice learners build community identity. However, employing the CoP framework to empirically identify best-practices and necessary skills to ensure effective participation to promote success among interdisciplinary teams to achieve common research goals has not been attempted before. Addressing this broad question is beyond the scope of a single research project. Therefore, researchers will begin by collecting empirical baseline data to demonstrate how interdisciplinary field-based CoPs develop during fieldwork and document the effectiveness of the CoP framework in promoting successful interdisciplinary research goals. The proposed work will use mixed-methods involving a combination of observations, focus group interviews, and surveys (pre-and-post) to evaluate how fieldwork fosters the development of CoPs, and how four elements of the CoP framework including coordination (hierarchical vs whole group), communication (visual, written, verbal, online, in person), mentoring, and shared leadership (differences between novice and expert decision making) influence the effectiveness of interdisciplinary learning environments across the novice to expert spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aromatic compounds are common building blocks throughout synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry, however the chemical reactions of aromatic molecules to give value-added commodities is often hindered because it results in the generation of multiple products, necessitating costly purification sequences. Dr. Gustafson and his team are studying new chemical reactions aimed at controlling the selective modification of both simple and complex aromatic scaffolds, ultimately resulting in more efficient synthetic strategies towards molecules of interest to the academic and pharmaceutical communities. In addition to providing training in organic chemistry for graduate and undergraduate students, this project also impacts the education more broadly in that it proposes to incorporate Virtual Reality experiences to aid students in the 3-dimensional visualization of molecules. Virtual Reality will also be utilized in outreach programs aimed at SDSU?s general population, as well as local high schools and community colleges.  <br/><br/>Professor Gustafson and his team of collaborators and students design ?organocatalysts? that affect the regioselective C-H functionalization of simple and complex aromatics through electrophilic aromatic substitution and related aromatic radical functionalization reactions. These transformations traditionally yield poor regioselectivities, often preventing them from being adopted as viable synthetic strategies, particularly in more complex settings. For the addition of electrophiles into aromatics, the Gustafson group designs bifunctional Lewis basic catalysts that intercept and direct the electrophile, or electrophilic radical to a specific position. The Gustafson group is also exploring similar strategies for the functionalization of aromatics with nucleophiles in the context of nucleophilic aromatic substitution and vicarious nucleophilic substitution.  For the regioselective addition of nucleophiles to aromatics, they utilize a broad array of classic organocatalytic strategies including cation directed catalysis and hydrogen-bonding catalysis. The ability to site-selectively modify simple and complex aromatic systems greatly simplifies the syntheses of molecules and opens the door for these chemistries to be used in the context of late-stage functionalization strategies. In order to allow for the design of better and more efficient catalysts, the Gustafson group is also performing mechanistic studies with collaborators in computational chemistry and electrochemistry. The site-selective modification of complex intermediates that this work enables has the potential to transform how the late-stage structural optimization of pharmaceuticals, materials and other functional molecules are carried out.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first decade of the ONSAP data collection effort is thus just complete, providing an unprecedented opportunity to determine changes in the North Atlantic Ocean, including changes resulting from ice sheet melting on Greenland and in the Arctic. The aims of this project are to quantify the temporal variability of the oceanic circulation, heat and salt transports, water mass components, and eddy processes in the West Greenland boundary current system, and to determine the effects or atmospheric circulation and storms on the water exchange between the boundary current system and the open waters of the Labrador Basin. Results from this project will improve our understanding of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which the West Greenland boundary current system is part of. Changes in the strength of the AMOC investigated here can have crucial effects on the climate of adjacent countries and world-wide. <br/><br/>The project has four main scientific objectives that will be explored through a variety of data analysis techniques using the decade-long West Greenland mooring dataset from OSNAP. Context for the work will be given through analysis of upstream and downstream timeseries data provided also through OSNAP and by European collaborators. The four main objectives are: (1) to quantify the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of the circulation and water mass components of the West Greenland boundary current system, (2) to document the year-to-year changes in the dominant mesoscale processes in the boundary current ? including the meandering/eddy formation and wind-driven upwelling ? and assess the resulting impacts on shelf-basin exchange of heat and salt and, ultimately, on convection in the basin, (3) to characterize the atmospheric circulation and storm climate that drive the wind- driven exchange between the West Greenland shelf and Labrador Basin, and (4) to quantify observationally for the first time the transport, seasonal variation, and dominant mesoscale processes of the West Greenland Coastal Current. This work, focused on the detailed processes and dynamics of the West Greenland boundary current system, will improve our understanding of the AMOC and its ramifications for climate. It will provide invaluable information for better interpreting the causes of AMOC variability and its links to freshwater discharge from the Arctic and Greenland as well as water mass transformation in the Labrador and Irminger Seas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of this fifth meeting will be on the role of optimization for Digital Twins. Digital Twins are expected to have a significant impact on science, engineering, and society. For instance, it is anticipated that they will lead to new developments in identifying weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, and wind turbines. Digital Twins of human organs have the potential to lead to cures of diseases that have long eluded researchers.  The variety of topics to be discussed in the meeting such as stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, and risk averse optimization are also of much wider interest beyond Digital Twins. The meeting will also provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two leading researchers in modeling, optimization, and scientific computing. <br/><br/>ECOM speakers and participants will study the key question of how to best utilize optimization to combine physics-based and data-driven models. This approach, when carried out for the entire complex physical system, for its lifetime, can be termed a ""Digital Twin."" One of the critical components of a Digital Twin, which distinguishes it from classical modeling, is the use of data over the entire lifetime of the physical system to update the Digital Twin. Subsequently, Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics, including modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. New algorithmic developments are expected in these areas and this workshop aims to dive deeper into the topics relevant to Digital Twins: optimization constrained by simulation, optimization under uncertainty, and inexact optimization algorithms. A particular focus of this workshop will be the identification and development of benchmark applications and software implementation. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on consequential problems and will discuss state-of-the-art optimization solvers to handle these problems. As a result, the attendees will be equipped to tackle a new set of challenging problems.

Changes in these seasonal patterns, whether due to natural variation or human influence, raise important questions about their effects on the relationships among species and the stability of natural communities. This project investigates how the timing of seasonal life cycles influences interactions among multiple species, especially those involving indirect effects, such as when one species impacts another through a shared predator or resource. Understanding these dynamics is crucial as ecosystems worldwide face rapid environmental changes. This project will also help predict the effects of shifting seasonal patterns on biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and services that benefit society. Members of the public will be engaged in the research through a citizen science initiative, and research training will be provided to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. <br/><br/>The proposed study will integrate experiments in amphibian pond communities with theoretical models to determine how variation in the sequence and spacing of phenologies of communities is linked to the dynamics of indirect interactions.

These experiments are designed to test competing hypotheses of how these critical aspects of temporal community structure are linked to the strength and direction of indirect interactions, and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Results from these experiments will guide the development of a temporally explicit community ecology model that incorporates seasonal variation in species? presence, timing, density, and traits. This model will evaluate what factors can amplify or diminish the influence of indirect interactions and examine the short- and long-term consequences of these patterns across different systems.

The work will offer novel rationales to design bio-inspired and force-responsive nanodevices for human health. It will also contribute new perspectives on the normal and defective mechanobiology of the nucleus, advancing our understanding of those critical cellular processes and the diseases that are caused by dysfunction in these systems.

Cells are very small and so they can best be observed with specialized techniques like electron microscopy. Samples must be preserved carefully for study by electron microscopy and care must be taken not to introduce changes that could mislead interpretation of observations.  The best method for preparing tissue for electron microscopy is to rapidly freeze samples and observe them under very low temperatures, a process called cryogenic preservation. Cryopreservation is challenging in plants, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop procedures that overcome these challenges. If successful, this proposal will allow plant cells and tissues to be observed after cryopreservation and give unprecedented information about how parts of plant cells and tissue work together. Understanding how plant cells work will help develop plants that are better able to meet human needs and ensure food security. The methods developed will be shared with others through public databases to allow other scientists to use the methods in their own studies. The research will include several early career scientists, and they will receive training in techniques and develop skills which are in high demand in science labs and in industry. <br/><br/>Cryogenic preservation is the gold standard for determining cell ultrastructure in its ?native state? by virtue of physical fixation (freezing) to immobilize cell constituents in milliseconds. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has gained significant traction as a tool for discovering the structure and spatial organization of cell and tissue components. In combination with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), cryo-vEM has the potential to yield a paradigm shift in multi-scale in situ structural biology. However, due to their physical and chemical properties, plant cells are uniquely recalcitrant to fixation. Thus, plant science is strikingly lagging other fields in the revolution of understanding of how macromolecular complexes and cell compartments coordinate to create life. Determining the structure of cells and organelles in fully frozen hydrated chemically untreated and unstained would allow, for the first time, the observation of these entities in their native states. This proposal will develop cryopreservation and nanoscale imaging procedures for vEM of plant tissues in a focused effort to address this challenge efficiently for the plant community. Whole cell structures will be elucidated in 3D using cryo-vEM, while nanoscale cellular structure and organelles will be determined using cryo-vEM and cryo-ET. The datasets, protocols, and analytical pipelines generated through this research will be made available to the scientific community and the public through public databases.

Prior work has identified chromatin modifying factors required for deposition of repressive chromatin marks at RNAi-targeted loci across eukaryotes. However, our understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing complex interactions between these two essential gene regulatory pathways remains rudimentary. Using the C. elegans germline as a model system and interdisciplinary approaches (genetics, physiological assays, multi-?omics approaches, and bioinformatics), we will test the hypothesis that feedback motifs between RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways ensure balance between the pathways to maintain appropriate regulation of a distinct set of genes and protect germ cell identity during heat stress. This project will advance our understanding of (1) the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of C. elegans germ cells during normal conditions; (2) how RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways collaborate to maintain this landscape during environmental stress; (3) how genetic and environmental perturbations affect gene regulatory pathways; and (4) the molecular mechanisms that maintain balance between these pathways to ensure homeostatic gene regulation. Moreover, the development of a tool to computationally identify putative feedback motifs using multi-?omics datasets in any species for any pathway will systematically improve our ability to identify and examine higher-order regulatory motifs that maintain transcriptome homeostasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, half of all fishes on a typical reef are cryptobenthic, but traditional surveys do not usually include these species. Due to the limited geographic extent of scientific surveys, countless cryptobenthic fish species have yet to be discovered and described, and local biodiversity inventories do not exist in most countries. This project explores the biodiversity of cryptobenthic coral reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific by:  1) conducting a series of local and regional inventories through standardized survey and collection protocols, 2) describing new species by considering multiple high-resolution sources of information to delineate closely related species, 3) analyzing the evolutionary diversification of a particularly species-rich lineage (the dwarf goby genus Eviota) and 4) training a new generation of fish taxonomists with strong ties to coral reef nations to ensure reef fish biodiversity research and conservation for years to come. <br/><br/>Inventorying the diversity of life on our planet is a critical challenge that intensifies with the rapid change of the biosphere. Cryptobenthic fishes, which include the world?s smallest and shortest-lived vertebrates, are a biodiversity taxonomic frontier. This research employs standardized sampling techniques across four locations in the Indo-Pacific that promises particularly rich biodiversity discovery (the Lakshadweep, Philippines, Solomons, and American Samoa) with a cutting-edge integrative taxonomy framework and immersive training of young scientists to boost description rates of cryptobenthic fishes for years to come. By implementing an innovative genomics approach to species delimitation, the project will also improve our knowledge about evolutionary processes in the sea, while establishing a promising new model system of small, short-lived, hyperdiverse vertebrates. Finally, the project will establish a dedicated online platform and a museum exhibit to engender scientific discovery and spark public interest in the world?s smallest marine vertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells are very small and so they can best be observed with specialized techniques like electron microscopy. Samples must be preserved carefully for study by electron microscopy and care must be taken not to introduce changes that could mislead interpretation of observations.  The best method for preparing tissue for electron microscopy is to rapidly freeze samples and observe them under very low temperatures, a process called cryogenic preservation. Cryopreservation is challenging in plants, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop procedures that overcome these challenges. If successful, this proposal will allow plant cells and tissues to be observed after cryopreservation and give unprecedented information about how parts of plant cells and tissue work together. Understanding how plant cells work will help develop plants that are better able to meet human needs and ensure food security. The methods developed will be shared with others through public databases to allow other scientists to use the methods in their own studies. The research will include several early career scientists, and they will receive training in techniques and develop skills which are in high demand in science labs and in industry. <br/><br/>Cryogenic preservation is the gold standard for determining cell ultrastructure in its ?native state? by virtue of physical fixation (freezing) to immobilize cell constituents in milliseconds. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has gained significant traction as a tool for discovering the structure and spatial organization of cell and tissue components. In combination with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), cryo-vEM has the potential to yield a paradigm shift in multi-scale in situ structural biology. However, due to their physical and chemical properties, plant cells are uniquely recalcitrant to fixation. Thus, plant science is strikingly lagging other fields in the revolution of understanding of how macromolecular complexes and cell compartments coordinate to create life. Determining the structure of cells and organelles in fully frozen hydrated chemically untreated and unstained would allow, for the first time, the observation of these entities in their native states. This proposal will develop cryopreservation and nanoscale imaging procedures for vEM of plant tissues in a focused effort to address this challenge efficiently for the plant community. Whole cell structures will be elucidated in 3D using cryo-vEM, while nanoscale cellular structure and organelles will be determined using cryo-vEM and cryo-ET. The datasets, protocols, and analytical pipelines generated through this research will be made available to the scientific community and the public through public databases. The proposed work will also provide unique training opportunities for several students and postdocs, training them in state-of-the plant structural biology, much desired expertise in the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding and reversing pollinator declines is one of the great environmental challenges of the 21st century. In the United States, migrating birds that usually eat insects have also been observed foraging in flowers. However, there has been little previous research on songbird flower foraging for this region. Understanding this behavior is important because migratory birds regularly move longer distances than insect pollinators. If birds are transporting pollen along these migratory routes, they could help improve genetic diversity in plant populations, making both natural and agricultural systems more resilient. This research will help raise awareness about the importance of birds and pollination for human wellbeing. For example, one of the project outcomes will be a short film showcasing this topic, which will be paired with other materials to create a teaching module for middle school students focused on the unexpected ways that animals help with plant pollination. Overall, this project is expected to improve understanding of birds and the potential role they play in pollination, a process that is critical to sustaining biodiversity and agricultural systems for future generations.<br/><br/>This project aims to fundamentally advance the way we understand plant-pollinator networks in North America by addressing the following research questions: 1) what individual bird characteristics or environmental factors are associated with the presence of pollen on songbirds?; 2) Are particular plant morphological characteristics associated with a higher probability of flower-foraging and pollen-carrying by songbirds?; 3) Does species richness or the relative abundance of functional groups contribute to resilience factors in bird-flower networks? The researchers will collaborate with bird banding stations to collect pollen samples from songbirds, and use DNA metabarcoding to identify the pollen. These data will be applied to models that will test predictions about the association between pollen presence, bird, and environmental characteristics, and to understand the links between plant characteristics and flower visitation by songbirds. This study has strong potential to stimulate new lines of research in songbird foraging and migration ecology, long-distance pollen dispersal, and plant-pollinator dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, closed-loop recycling is hindered by the high impurity content in post-consumer scrap and the tight compositional bounds of commercial alloys, leading to either downcycling of scrap or its dilution with primary metal. To minimize the use of non-renewable and carbon-intensive primary aluminum, this project is identifying the chemical limits of scrap-related impurities that can be tolerated without sacrifices to mechanical performance. To this end, a combination of experiments, simulations, and machine learning are employed to elucidate how impurities impact the microscopic structure of alloys and their mechanical behavior across length scales. The insights sought in this project have the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of aluminum alloys and maximize their reuse in advanced structural components. Although focused on aluminum alloys, the developments of this project are applicable to the design of a broader range of advanced structural alloys, such as steels. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This project is investigating how damage depends on the composition and microstructure of aluminum alloys with a high content of scrap-related impurities. The goal is to establish compositional limits that identify alloys suitable for wrought applications and to understand the corresponding transitions in the damage behavior. In pursuit of this goal, the project is integrating experiments, crystal plasticity simulations, and multimodal machine learning. The experiments aim to elucidate the interplay among intermetallic compounds (IMCs), polycrystalline microstructure, dislocation content, and damage as a function of composition and processing. Crystal plasticity finite element simulations are exploring how void nucleation, growth, and coalescence depend on the microstructure with a focus on spatial, size, and shape distributions of IMCs. Data from these simulations are being used to calibrate an efficient machine learning model to capture the microstructure dependence of damage evolution under loading. Additionally, the project is developing a language-image model to predict microstructure as a function of composition and processing in aluminum alloys. Together, these models are seeking the compositional limits of multicomponent aluminum alloys with damage behavior suitable for high-performance applications. Beyond research, the project is developing an educational program to promote computational literacy among materials science students and contribute to interdisciplinary materials workforce by attracting applied mathematics students to the field of materials science. In aggregate, this project is thereby supporting NSF?s goals of helping to produce a next generation STEM workforce while also pursuing science at the frontiers of such grand challenges as sustainability, resource stewardship and accelerated, intelligent materials design as called for by the Materials Genome Initiative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Michigan faces logistical challenges in providing widespread Computer Science (CS) education: only 55% of high schools offer it at all, much less to all students. At the same time, data science ? with its job prospects and ties to artificial intelligence?is vying for the same attention. Ideally, the two subjects could be taught together while meeting relevant standards and supporting diverse students in learning both subjects. The practitioners in this Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) ?  state education leaders in Michigan?see opportunity in Algebra 2. It is a graduation requirement that many students struggle to pass and many teachers see as needing reform. At the same time, state data show that college enrollment has risen since the requirement was adopted, especially for students from historically underrepresented groups in computing. Algebra 2 prepares students for calculus and many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects in college. This RPP will address problems of practice for CS and mathematics education by integrating computing as needed for Data Science into Algebra 2. The project team will offer professional learning workshops and ongoing support to teachers across Michigan. The research team will use a mixed-methods design to study the factors that motivate districts and teachers to explore, adopt, and deepen their use of the project?s materials, with an eye towards how this differs across regions and student demographics across Michigan. This RPP will also study the impact of this curriculum on girls and students from rural areas. If successful, the project will provide a model for expanding access to computing and data science while improving student outcomes in Algebra 2. It might also impact students? confidence and perceived relevance of Algebra 2 (issues that are known to affect girls and rural students in particular), which could in turn influence students? future course and career interests. <br/><br/>The Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum is a mature program with STEMworks certification and an underlying research foundation that covers significant portions of the standards from the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), mathematics, and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).

The successful realization of quantum computers has the potential to transform diverse fields such as drug discovery, quantum chemistry, biology, cryptography, image processing, optimization, and machine learning by addressing computational challenges that are infeasible for classical systems. Estimates suggest that general-purpose quantum computers capable of solving real-world problems will require 10??10? physical qubits. A significant obstacle to scaling quantum computers to this level is the hardware infrastructure, which currently relies on room-temperature rack electronics for qubit control and readout, along with bulky, connectorized microwave components?such as circulators and amplifiers?inside dilution refrigerators. This project aims to address these limitations by developing energy-efficient, low-cost, and compact cryogenic chips that enable scaling quantum systems to support thousands of qubits.

These innovations are expected to accelerate breakthroughs in quantum computing while also benefiting related fields such as satellite communication, space-based telescopes, and cryogenic electronics. Furthermore, the project seeks to foster seamless integration between circuit design and quantum physics, laying the foundation for a diverse and skilled workforce in this multidisciplinary research domain. To achieve this, the project will implement a range of educational and outreach initiatives, including online courses, undergraduate research opportunities, career development workshops for K-12 students, and the creation of open-source infrastructure.<br/><br/>The research activities are organized into three thrusts: cryogenic (4K) CMOS IC development, superconducting chip development, and system integration with superconducting qubits operating at 10-100mK. First, a fully analog, low-power, and scalable qubit control scheme will be demonstrated using CMOS ICs operating at 4K, eliminating the need for room-temperature rack electronics. Unlike current digital-intensive control schemes, this project explores low-power microwave pulse generation using analog filter synthesis, enabling significant power savings compared to state-of-the-art digital qubit control circuits. Analog multiplexing schemes will be explored to reduce the cabling overheard between the 4K to 10mK stages. Second, time-modulated Josephson Junction-based non-reciprocal devices will be developed to replace the bulky and costly ferrite-based circulators and isolators currently used in dilution refrigerators. These on-chip, superconducting circulators are expected to offer drastically reduced size and cost when compared to their ferrite counterparts. To aid easier integration with the qubits, these superconducting circulators will be designed to achieve to low intermodulation power while achieving low-loss transmission and high isolation at the input frequency.  Finally, the cryogenic-CMOS ICs and superconducting circulators will be integrated with superconducting qubits to demonstrate a fully integrated closed-loop system for qubit control and readout.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Learners with dyslexia often struggle to develop foundational reading skills, leading to disparities in academic achievement and limited opportunities. This project addresses these challenges by developing an innovative, technology-driven solution that enhances decoding ability through customized reading practice. By integrating advanced speech recognition technology with evidence-based teaching methods, the solution provides personalized, scalable, and affordable learning experiences tailored to the needs of dyslexic learners. The technology identifies reading errors with unprecedented granularity, generating adaptive learning content to empower learners to overcome obstacles and build fluency. This initiative has the potential to improve decoding skills for hundreds of thousands of at-risk readers, helping to close educational gaps and create equitable opportunities. Beyond individual benefits, the societal impact includes fostering academic confidence, increasing graduation rates, and enhancing employability, contributing to the well-being of communities. Commercially, this project positions itself as an innovative educational solution, offering tools to help learners and institutions address one of the most pervasive barriers to literacy and lifelong success.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project brings reading error identification to an unprecedentedly fine granularity and generates engaging practice contents on an adaptive difficulty level to improve dyslexic readers? decoding ability. Dyslexia often causes reading errors including insertions, deletions, substitutions in phonemes, which are mostly autocorrected by traditional word-level automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. Additionally, personalized reading contents for dyslexic readers is expensive to generate on a scale. Therefore, to achieve ideal error tracking accuracy and provide affordable, accessible and personalized reading contents to dyslexic population, this project proposes to: (a) build a grapheme-phoneme extension of existing phoneme-only pronunciation dictionary, (b) train an accurate phonetic ASR specifically devoted to transcribing dyslexic readers? utterances that preserves reading errors, (c) refine the downstream error tracking solutions to identify decoding challenges down to grapheme-phoneme level, and (4) complete a customized story generation pipeline to create easily decodable and interest-infused reading contents.  At its accomplishment, this project will achieve above 97% coverage of the original pronunciation dictionary, below 15% phonetic error rate for its phonetic ASR component, below 10% false alarm rate for its error tracking model, and above 95% success rate for its customized story generation pipeline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a class of biological molecules that lack a single, fixed three-dimensional structure. Instead, these molecules can interconvert between distinct, transient forms that play important roles in cellular processes such as molecular recognition, signaling, and regulation. The dynamic and flexible nature of IDPs makes them prone to aggregation into ordered amyloid fibrils or to liquid-liquid phase separation into protein-rich droplets important for normal cellular function. Understanding the biophysical principles that lead to these distinct molecular assemblies will provide insights into cellular processes, the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and the design of bio-inspired materials with unique properties. Beyond these scientific outcomes, this project will enhance undergraduate education by integrating computational methods into the biochemistry curriculum. Students will gain hands-on experience in advanced computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and mathematical modeling. The project includes the development of an online biophysical chemistry textbook integrated with real-world examples, programming-focused curriculum modules, and a computational workshop to train undergraduate research students.

From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry.

Increasing accuracy in projections of wildland fire activity, fire behavior, and wildland fire weather is the key toward developing more efficient fire control strategies and reducing the risks of wildfires. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) can help in planning for upcoming prescribed burns by providing higher spatial and temporal fire weather forecasts and can also assist in developing more efficient strategies for wildfire risk mitigation. However, the modeling tools that are currently used to predict fire activity are largely subject to a number of temporal or spatial constraints. For instance, most deep learning (DL) approaches for wildfire risk analytics tend to be restricted in their capabilities to systematically capture the multidimensional information recorded at disparate spatio-temporal resolutions. Furthermore, such DL architectures are inherently static and do not explicitly account for complex dynamic phenomena, which is often the key behind the accurate assessment of wildfire driving factors. Finally, these models primarily rely on supervised learning approaches where a large number of task-specific labels (e.g., fire or no fire) are needed. To address these challenges in wildfire risk analytics, this project will leverage inherently interdisciplinary approaches at the interface of Earth system sciences, DL, computational topology, statistics, and actuarial sciences. <br/><br/>The project aims to introduce the concepts of topological data analysis (TDA) to wildfire predictive modeling, coupling them with such emerging AI machinery as time-aware graph neural networks. The resulting new methods are expected to better capture the shape patterns in the wildland fire processes with respect both to time and space and to assist in a more reliable statistical assessment of wildfire risks. The new high-fidelity predictive approaches will have the potential to deliver forecasts of fire behavior, fire activity, and fire weather at multiple spatial and temporal scales under scenarios of limited, noisy, or nonexistent labeled information. To enhance the utility of the research solutions in wildfire analytics, the researchers in this project will work in close collaboration with stakeholders, particularly, focusing on the insurance sector.

Each year in the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of people become ill from consuming contaminated food products, resulting in billions of dollars in medical costs and lost wages. Current testing approaches rely on taking small samples from large production lots, which is both time-consuming and potentially unreliable. This new technology enables rapid screening of entire production batches, dramatically reducing both testing costs and time, while improving detection reliability. The system's affordability and simplicity make it particularly valuable for widespread deployment across the food supply chain - from farms to processing facilities to consumer-facing establishments. By enabling comprehensive testing at the source, this technology could reduce foodborne illness outbreaks while helping food producers operate more efficiently and maintain product quality.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a two-part food safety detection system that overcomes key limitations of current testing methods. The first component uses specially engineered polymer channels that can process large sample volumes and concentrate bacteria into small areas for analysis. The second component employs advanced optical techniques to rapidly identify bacterial species without requiring additional chemicals or labels. The system can process and analyze entire production lots in minutes rather than hours, while providing more reliable results than traditional sampling methods. Laboratory testing has demonstrated the ability to selectively capture and identify harmful bacteria from complex samples with high accuracy. The technology maintains sensitivity while eliminating complex sample preparation steps, making it practical for real-world deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Restoring arm and hand function would greatly increase their independence.  Assistive robotics and functional electrical stimulation can potentially restore arm and hand function, but each has significant drawbacks. The objective of this project is to develop a cooperative control strategy for functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high cervical spinal cord injuries using functional electrical stimulation and a robotic exoskeleton. The results of the project will help move functional electrical stimulation and upper limb robotics from laboratory assistive technologies to wearable devices used for everyday tasks by people with full-arm paralysis.      <br/><br/>The complementary strengths of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and assistive robotics can potentially enable people with high tetraplegia to independently feed and groom themselves. FES provides free power using a person?s own muscles but cannot sufficiently control all joints simultaneously due to permanent denervation of some muscles. Assistive robots can provide additional power and control, but can be rigid, bulky, and heavy. This project's objective is to develop a cooperative control strategy that demonstrates functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high tetraplegia using a hybrid FES+rigid support robot. By maximizing the utility of muscles activated by FES, the proposed hybrid strategy will reduce the need for robot power and size, paving the way for using FES with soft wearable robotics. This project will use a rigid robot as the testbed for developing cooperative control strategies, allowing for exploration of the entire design space for future development of soft wearable exosuits coupled with FES. FES+robot assisted muscle-induced torques will be measured in real time during elbow and wrist movements. This information will feed into a coordinated FES+robot control scheme that aims to decrease robot work while maintaining tracking accuracy. Performance and robustness of the control scheme will be benchmarked for varying robot capabilities during a self-feeding task. The outcome will be a model, mapping robot capabilities to task completion success, to be used to design future wearable hybrid FES-robotic systems for upper limb movement restoration. These advances will open up new research horizons in commanding and controlling hybrid neuroprostheses that could not otherwise be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reforms call for the direct election of more than 7,000 of the most important judicial positions in the country. Because judicial independence is associated with salutary governmental and economic outcomes, and public support for judicial institutions is a key determinant of judicial independence and influence, this project has implications for understanding how the direct election of judges might bolster or undermine institutional separation of powers, economic development, and broader international relations. <br/><br/>Most of the accumulated knowledge about the public's support for the judiciary has relied upon surveys asking citizens for their evaluations of hypothetical proposals to reform the country's high Court. The reforms that prompt this study provide an opportunity to test theories about the correlates and consequences of public support for courts in an environment where the stakes are real and cross-national comparisons are feasible. Tracking public opinion over a four-wave panel survey and analyzing unique survey experiments, this research will address three debates.  First, each wave of the survey will reach respondents at a point in the reform implementation that enables researchers to disentangle longstanding theories regarding the determinants of public support for judicial institutions. Second, relying on within-respondent, cross-wave comparisons, the PIs will evaluate the extent to which the electoral connection affects citizens? legal attitudes about courts and judicial authorities, and their willingness to engage them as a result. Third, the PIs will assess how the reform---and citizens' responses to it---affect their willingness to obey decisions they do not agree with and to tolerate noncompliance with constitutional authorities' decisions.

The outcomes of this study will enhance our understanding of how marine pathogens, like vibrios, acquire toxic traits and pose threats to public health. The results will provide valuable data in guiding emergency responses in the face of future storms.<br/><br/>The recent back-to-back hurricanes in Florida, Helene and Milton, caused extensive flooding that released untreated wastewater carrying antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) from freshwater environments into coastal waters. The spread of ARGs into marine ecosystems poses a significant public health threat, as it can lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant marine bacteria, including species such as Vibrio vulnificus, a pathogen associated with severe and sometimes fatal infections. This project will investigate how storm-driven flooding facilitates the horizontal transfer of ARGs between freshwater and marine bacteria, contributing to the long-term persistence of ARGs in coastal ecosystems. Key objectives include identifying antibiotic resistant freshwater bacteria entering coastal waters, examining the horizontal transfer of ARGs within biofilms in coastal waters, and assessing the persistence of ARGs in marine bacteria over time. Samples collected after the hurricanes will be analyzed using long-read metagenomics, single-colony sequencing, and microbial community analysis to track bacterial origins and resolve ARG profiles, as well as stable isotope analysis to differentiate freshwater and marine bacterial populations. This study will highlight how hurricanes amplify the risks of ARGs entering marine ecosystems and conferring antibiotic resistance to pathogens.

This doctoral dissertation research focuses on the domestication of camelids (llamas and alpacas). As the only large-bodied domesticated animals native to the Americas, camelids have been integral to multiple societies for millennia, providing transportation, wool, and meat. Despite their cultural and economic importance, the genetic diversity of modern camelid populations has drastically declined due to environmental pressures and human interventions, particularly from colonial-era impacts. This project investigates how ancient communities adapted their subsistence strategies amidst the shifting environmental conditions of the deep past. The work has significant implications for modern conservation efforts, offering potential strategies for preserving the genetic diversity of camelids in the face of contemporary challenges such as environmental change and habitat fragmentation. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project integrates archaeogenomics, isotopic analysis, and environmental data to examine the processes of camelid domestication and management. Researchers combine carbon and nitrogen isotopic data from camelid bones with dental calculus analysis to reconstruct the diets of grazing ancient herds. Additionally, analysis of ancient mitochondrial DNA (aDNA) sheds light on the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication process, providing critical insights into how human and environmental pressures influenced the genetic diversity of camelid populations over time.

Electrochemical approaches open the door to the use of electrical energy derived from sustainable sources such as wind and solar energy.  Although significant advances have been made in electrochemical reactions promoted by catalysts (i.e., electrocatalysis), many challenges remain.  Experimental studies alone often cannot unravel the complex chemical and physical processes underlying electrocatalytic reactions.  The present project addresses this ?complexity challenge? by adding theoretical and mathematics-based analysis of electrocatalytic reactions of importance to fuel cell technology and sustainable manufacturing of chemicals.<br/>  <br/>Until recently, atomistic simulation methods, primarily rooted in density functional theory (DFT), have been used to provide insights regarding catalysis at the electrochemical interface.  However, the complexity of chemistry, physics and transport mechanisms at the interface limits the models to small scales and special atomic configurations, which are often not realistic enough to accurately describe the interfacial processes.  With regard to catalysis, DFT based models alone are challenged in providing information about reaction activation energies, thus preventing direct assessment of reaction rates.  The project addresses these limitations by developing an accurate and efficient method to enable large-scale simulations for heterogeneous electrocatalysis.  Machine learning force field (ML FF) is a promising approach to realize such simulations.  The project will further enhance MLFF capability by adding features that describe the behavior of electrons under the grand canonical ensemble (GCE) in the catalyst.  The expanded ML FF model (called ?e-GCE-FF?) will be enabled by leveraging 'global state' features of graph neural networks developed previously by the research team.  The integrated e-GCE-FF approach will be used to study pH and cation effects in heterogeneous electrocatalysis.  Specifically, the project will address two long-standing questions: 1) why oxygen reduction on Au (100) proceeds through a two-electron pathway under acidic conditions, while changing to a four-electron pathway under alkaline conditions; and 2) why larger electrolyte cations promote the hydrogen evolution on Au while suppressing it on Pt?  More broadly, the  expanded MLFF code will be made open-source, and can be extended to other electrochemical systems (e.g. battery, corrosion).  From the educational and outreach perspectives, the project will provide an excellent training opportunity for students interested in computational chemistry and data science. The research results will be integrated into the course curriculum, and the project leader will actively engage the general public through the university?s outreach programs such as ?Explore UT?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tracking public opinion over a four-wave panel survey and analyzing unique survey experiments, this research will address three debates.  First, each wave of the survey will reach respondents at a point in the reform implementation that enables researchers to disentangle longstanding theories regarding the determinants of public support for judicial institutions. Second, relying on within-respondent, cross-wave comparisons, the PIs will evaluate the extent to which the electoral connection affects citizens? legal attitudes about courts and judicial authorities, and their willingness to engage them as a result. Third, the PIs will assess how the reform---and citizens' responses to it---affect their willingness to obey decisions they do not agree with and to tolerate noncompliance with constitutional authorities' decisions.

Physical activities like walking and running enhance healing by influencing these cells. Mimicking these mechanical signals offers a promising avenue for creating biotechnologies that accelerate tissue regeneration, reduce medical costs, and improve quality of life. However, designing precise mechanical signals to guide healing and regeneration at the cellular level remains a challenge. This award supports research to quantify the mechanical forces at work inside living cells and determine whether changes in these forces impact how the cells produce and secrete proteins that shape their surrounding environment. Gaining this knowledge could lead to predictive tools that use mechanical forces to control cell behavior, enabling advances in tissue engineering, clinical treatments, and diagnostics for identifying and addressing diseases.

The model will allow for the analysis of forces generated by actin cytoskeleton and the quantification intra-nuclear of stresses in a cell-specific manner. The research team will validate the model by experimentally tracking 3D nuclear deformations and advance mechanobiology knowledge by: (1) Developing predictive mechanobiotechnology paradigms to control cell anabolism via externally applied mechanical forces. (2) Producing a foundational, cell-specific dataset that can inform or train clinical imaging modalities, such as CT and in-situ probes, to improve diagnoses of conditions including osteoporosis, hypertension, cancer, and age-related extracellular matrix stiffening.

It will use seismic observations and methods to advance understanding of volcanic hazards and the fundamental processes that create different types of volcanoes and magma types. This volcanic system is active, and the presence of nearby population centers means the Three Sisters is classified as a Very High Threat volcanic system for the U.S. The Three Sisters volcanic complex includes a wide variety of volcanic structures and geologically young lavas (about 2,000 years old). Additionally, about two decades of satellite data show that areas near the volcanoes are deforming due to inflation under the surface. Existing data are scarce partly because the immediate vicinity of the volcanoes is a difficult to access and federally protected Wilderness. This project will add observations in these areas by using small temporary seismic instruments, that can be transported on foot and do not require digging, to address both the accessibility challenges and the need for minimal impact. Combining the new temporary seismic data with modern imaging and earthquake detection methods, the researchers will gain a systematic view of subsurface structures. This will assist in more rigorously understanding the record of prior eruptions and ongoing monitoring of deformation. The seismic data collection and analysis will engage students from multiple institutions and personnel from regional hazard monitoring agencies to promote professional training and communication to stakeholders.<br/><br/>The Three Sisters volcanic complex is classified by a U.S. Geologic Survey report as a Very High Threat system, with geodetic evidence for ongoing surface deformation, lava flows as young as about 1,600 years, and Holocene eruptions of compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. Yet, there is little knowledge of the 3-D distribution of middle to upper crustal magma storage and microseismicity beneath this multi-vent volcanic complex located within the High Cascades graben. Observational seismology has been limited by the need for minimal impact in a large federal Wilderness. The project will deploy an array of low-impact nodal seismometers to provide the first local imaging of the Three Sisters magmatic system. Analysis of the data will advance understanding of how magma reservoir structure in multi-vent systems is linked to spatial variations in edifice construction and erupted compositions, with dominantly basaltic andesite in the northern part of the volcanic complex transitioning to more prevalent rhyolite eruptions at the southern end. Seismic imaging with the new temporary network data will begin with relatively conventional ambient noise surface wave tomography and then push the boundaries of temporary nodal array imaging by applying anisotropic adjoint tomography. The influences of edifice topography and radial anisotropy on magma reservoir imaging will be tested with numerical 3-D wave propagation and inversion methods. The new data will also be used to scrutinize microseismic activity and conduct receiver function imaging of localized interfaces, which could better define interactions between tectonic and magmatic deformation structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these variations or mutations are not evenly dispersed throughout the genome. Variation is highest where regulatory proteins bind to DNA, a process that is poorly understood despite the fact that these changes can significantly impact human biology. This project will determine whether genomic variation is increased because protein binding makes DNA more susceptible to damage, and subsequently mutations, or because proteins block repair of damaged DNA leading to mutations. Assessing these possibilities requires development of innovative methods. This project will not only answer the question of whether proteins make DNA more susceptible to damage or harder to repair, but the newly developed methods will be a major leap forward in quantitative measurement of DNA damage. To ensure the broader impact of the newly developed methods, investigators will reach out to the next generations of scientists in two ways. A workshop entitled ?What is Damaging My DNA? will be offered to high school students to engage the younger generation. In addition, an intensive summer workshop entitled ?Computational Thinking for Academic Professionals? will be offered to academic scientists who need training handling larger datasets, such as those in this project.<br/><br/>Transcription factor (TF) proteins bind to specific DNA sequences across the genome to regulate gene expression. Surprisingly, recent genomic studies indicate that TF binding sites are characterized by increased DNA damage and are highly enriched for somatic mutations, suggesting that TF?DNA binding is mutagenic. This project hypothesizes that that TFs induce unique patterns of lesion accumulation within binding sites, which are dictated by the ability of TFs to enhance lesion formation and to occlude access to the nucleotide excision repair machinery. UV light will be used as a source of DNA damage to develop high?throughput in vitro techniques and quantitative models for: the affinity of TFs from different families for lesion-containing DNA and ability to compete with repair proteins; and the modulation of DNA damage formation by TF binding. These models will be used to predict genome?wide DNA damage and repair in human cells and to develop cell?based assays of damage and repair in genomic contexts.

Specifically, the project performs the following tasks: First, conducting numerical simulations using a four-way coupled method to identify the effects of firebrand properties and their interactions within the boundary layer on the deposition patterns over an inert flat surface. Second, incorporating surface fuel morphology into the computational domain, using X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT), and quantitatively discern its influence on firebrand deposition patterns and heat transfer. Third, leveraging the generated data from high-fidelity simulations, developing a data-driven heat transfer model, and testing its accuracy. The developed model makes the findings applicable for large-scale (operational) wildfire simulators, culminating in the development of a physics-based spot fire ignition module.

These points are thought to be closely related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), but the balance of contributions to North Atlantic carbon accumulation from air-sea fluxes and ocean transports is not well constrained. There is significant uncertainty about what the future holds, both for AMOC strength and carbon uptake as they respond to the effects of climate change and other changing forcings. This project will utilize long-term and ongoing observations across the North Atlantic basin to quantify carbon uptake and carbon transport and the variability in these parameters on the time scale of decades. This work will support a variety of efforts to educate and promote underrepresented groups in ocean science. The project investigators will partner with a variety of institutions in Georgia, Florida and in the Caribbean to educate students at a range of levels. They will promote a carbon cycle education website that includes interactive K-12 education materials. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>The ROCCA project aims to redefine our understanding of the North Atlantic carbon system, one of the world?s most important regions for carbon sequestration on climatically-important timescales. The team will use new estimates of anthropogenic carbon transports across both subtropical and subpolar domains to determine the contributions of air-sea fluxes and ocean circulation to regional carbon accumulation, a fundamental knowledge gap. This analysis will enable evaluation of their combined effects on future carbon uptake as overturning strength is projected to weaken. New observations in Florida Straits will fully characterize the chemical variability in water mass structure on seasonal timescales for the first time, and in combination with air-sea anthropogenic CO2 fluxes derived from transport-divergence/accumulation budgets, the team will validate existing numerical simulations and improve the representation of carbon cycle processes in the next generation of climate models. The specific research objectives are to <br/>1.	Calculate anthropogenic carbon transports across the RAPID array at 26N (2004 to 2024) and the subpolar OSNAP section (2014-2024), including sensitivity to AMOC changes; <br/>2.	Produce time-series of changing anthropogenic carbon inventory in the North Atlantic; <br/>3.	Air-sea anthropogenic carbon flux timeseries from accumulation (O1) and transport divergence (O2); <br/>4.	Constrain projections of future change and identify anthropogenic carbon transport / AMOC metrics; and <br/>5.	Assess the uncertainty of components of the observational approach, applying them to high-resolution model outputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite significant efforts to develop effective cancer diagnosis and therapeutics, the ability to predict patient responses to anti-cancer therapeutic agents remains elusive. This is a critical milestone as getting the right choice of therapy early can mean superior anti-tumor outcomes and increased survival, while the wrong choice means tumor relapse, development of resistance, side effects without the desired benefit, and increased cost of treatment. An cyber-physical system that allows an accurate prediction of patient tumor responses to anti-cancer therapies; that is, enable real-time precision medicine, can have a transformative effect not only on health outcomes, but also on the costs of treatment. The goal of this project is therefore to develop an engineered cyber-physical system that combines advanced biological models with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods for predictive, automated screening of anti-cancer drugs and optimizations of their dosing. This will move science towards realizing the long-desired precision medicine paradigm leading to significant social impacts. The project has additional social impacts, including minimizing the exponentially growing ethical issues surrounding the use of animals in the past years through increased adoption of the engineered human cancer and heart tissue model systems. The project will provide opportunities to promote STEM education for K-12 students, train students, especially those from under-represented groups, and disseminate science and engineering knowledge to the public.<br/><br/>The investigators will leverage their expertise in biofabrication, tissue engineering, microfluidics, bioanalysis, and artificial intelligence to develop a generalized, self-dose-optimizing ""multi-sensor-integrated multi-organ-on-a-chip"" platform, which can be used to accurately predict both efficacy and safety of anti-cancer regimens in this project. The first innovation is the adoption of three-dimensional bioprinting for generating the vascularized ductal carcinoma model and vascularized cardiac tissue model, leading to the construction of a truly biomimetic human myocardium for evaluating drug toxicity. The adaptation of both of the bioprinted models to microfluidic systems is also a major innovation. Additionally, the real-time yet non-invasive monitoring of key biophysicochemical parameters will generate large-scale multi-dimensional data to enable accurate data-driven predictive modeling. Moreover, the platform will enable self-dose-optimization on the chips through a novel joint Bayes modeling implemented by two deep learning models capable of addressing multiple-instance learning, and dependency in sequences of multi-dimensional data, respectively. The project will use a range of commercially available cells to construct models and pursue the initial platform development and optimizations. Extensions are anticipated for human specimens in future iterations and other cancer treatment, drug combination, and dose optimization in anti-cancer regimens as a rapid and safe testing-bed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, numerous experimental labs study how the strengths of synaptic connections and their dynamics affect cognition by establishing empirical correlations between in vitro electrophysiology measurements and data collected in animal behavioral experiments. However, these correlations fall short of causal explanations: to date, there exist no mechanisms connecting recordings in individual neurons and synapses with cognitive learning dynamics. The problem is not due to a lack of observations at either the neuronal or the systemic level; rather, it reflects a principal gap in our ability to link these two scales. Even if a full description of every neuron in the brain could be produced, there would still be a gap in our ability to transition from local data to making qualitative conclusions about how it combines to produce systemic cognitive outcomes. Addressing this problem requires a conceptual framework encompassing a computational model that would link the experimentally derived characteristics of individual cells with effects of those characteristics at the ensemble level.<br/> <br/>The proposed research aims to provide a way to establish such a connection: developing a data-driven, systemic model of hippocampal spatial learning based on the parameters of the hippocampal synaptic architecture, including the parameters of synaptic plasticity, using novel topological and geometric techniques. Recent developments in Algebraic Topology will be used to integrate the parameters of synaptic connectivity and synaptic plasticity (e.g., long- and short-term potentiation and depression), to study structure of this map, the mechanisms of its formation and deterioration, and to evaluate the time required to produce a spatial map of a given environment, etc. This project is a natural evolution of prior work done by the Dabaghian group on modeling the mechanisms of spatial learning, based on algebraic topology methods developed by the M?moli group. The theory-based insight into learning phenomena will produce a qualitatively better understanding of how to interpret data, how to design new experiments, what variables should be targeted in measurements, as well as how to minimize use of animals, and in general how to optimize use physical and intellectual resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The innovation of this project comes from training personalized models that learn exclusively from each person?s wearable data. Recent advances in AI methods allow us to train these models to understand each user?s individual biosignals patterns related to heart rate, movement, and other signal recordings using large amounts of unlabeled data that are recorded when the user wears the device. This should, in theory, enable us to refine these models to learn to predict relatively complex recurring health outcomes like stress and blood pressure spikes using much fewer labeled examples than what would have previously been necessary. We will test this paradigm in two user studies related to stress-related hypertension and substance use detection.<br/><br/>The status quo for machine learning consists of the development of a one-size-fits-all model which is usually trained on data coming from one group and tested on data from another disjoint group. However, the advent of self-supervised learning makes it possible to learn from vast unlabeled multimodal data streams recorded from a single individual, allowing for a pretrained model which learns feature representations which are specific to the baseline temporal dynamics of a single entity?s data streams. This project seeks to understand how such personalized self-supervised learning on multimodal data streams can be used to overfit, in a positive manner, a machine learning model to the unique patterns of an individual?s sensor readings, thus enabling model personalization and prediction of traditionally difficult or subjective targets. To make these artificial intelligence (AI) innovations practically useful and because these personalized models still require on the order of tens of annotations to converge, we propose to develop novel human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques which are tightly integrated into the AI workflow to facilitate reliable and effective yet minimal annotations of the adverse health event of interest from the end user.

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many areas of the country, people with a higher income live up to decade longer than those in the lowest income levels. Additionally, the pandemic itself has hit low income and under-served populations especially hard. Biased medical decision-making contributes to this health inequality. For example, previous work has shown that one of widely used health risk prediction algorithms assesses African-American patients as less sick than equivalently sick White patients. This research will make medical decision-making fairer by statistically analyzing the decisions made both by humans and by algorithms. The research will identify sources of bias (for example, when medical tests are given to patients with better access to healthcare rather than to patients most likely to have a disease), and propose solutions (for example, reallocating tests to patients who are predicted to have the highest disease risk). This will not only make healthcare fairer; it can also make it more efficient, by allocating medical resources where they will do the most good. The project will also create a publicly available class on how to design fair algorithms, and conduct a large-scale study of how engineers can be trained to design fairer algorithms, to improve the preparedness of the engineering workforce.<br/><br/>Because important medical decisions are made both by humans and by algorithms, the research pursues three objectives: 1) detecting bias in human medical decision-making, focusing on three high-stakes medical settings: allocation of medical testing, healthcare quality assessment, and interpretation of medical images. Further, the project will also build algorithmic decision-aids to reduce human bias, by drawing clinicians? attention to medically relevant features they may have overlooked. Finally, the project targets making algorithmic decision-making more equitable, by examining the features it is appropriate to include in a medical algorithm. The research will be conducted in collaboration with clinicians to maximize translational benefit to patients. The methods developed, which draw on techniques in Bayesian inference and deep learning to provide interpretable models of how bias arises, are more generally applicable to decision-making across a host of high-stakes domains?including lending and hiring?and thus can impact a wide range of fields concerned with equity in decision-making, including law and economics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Filters are extensively used to compactly represent large datasets in fast memory (RAM) and avoid unnecessary I/Os across databases, storage systems, computational biology, cybersecurity, and networks. Yet modern data-intensive applications are severely bottlenecked by the limitations in filters. A fundamental limitation of traditional filters is that they do not change their representation upon seeing a false positive match. Therefore, the maximum false positive rate is only guaranteed for a single query, not a stream of queries. If users can adapt after seeing false positive matches, they can improve the filter performance for a stream of queries (especially skewed distributions). This project focuses on two goals. First, to design a high-performance, space-efficient, and practical adaptive filter with strong adaptivity guarantees, which means that the performance and false-positive probability guarantees continue to hold even for adversarial workloads. Second, to do a deep dive into various performance trade-offs in applications and integrate the adaptive filter in databases, cybersecurity applications, and computational biology tools. The effort redesigns existing applications and develops new software tools to establish appropriate trade-offs and achieve high performance and space efficiency. <br/><br/>This project has the following top-level approach: develop the theory and an accompanying data structure library for strong adaptive filters under various real-world workloads involving deletions and updates, resizing, and merging two adaptive filters.  It demonstrates the impact of adaptive filters in the real world by integrating the adaptive filter into applications and achieving massive speed-ups and robust performance for skewed and adversarial workloads. This project will enhance the capability of applications across databases, computational biology, and cybersecurity to achieve higher and stronger performance guarantees. Both accelerated computation (allowing quicker feedback and more experiments) and more extensive computation potentially accelerate the process of scientific discovery. Furthermore, this project places a strong emphasis on combining theory and practice. In addition, the research team will also develop teaching material on adaptive data structures and their usage in modern data-intensive applications and make it freely available online.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the connection between genes and the energy-related traits those genes encode is complicated for two primary reasons: (1) energy-related genes are spread across three separate cellular compartments (the nucleus, the chloroplasts, and the mitochondria), and (2) all plants have experienced one or more whole genome duplication events, in which the nuclear genome has been doubled or more, during their evolutionary history. Indeed, many of our most important crop species have more than two copies of their nuclear genome inside their cells. How this ?genomic redundancy? affects energy production is largely unknown; however, the balance between nuclear genome copy number and the mitochondria and chloroplasts appear to be critical to plant energy production. We will employ and train students and researchers to investigate how plant cells maintain this balance. <br/><br/>Whole genome duplication events (WGDs), in which the nuclear genome is doubled or more as a result of allopolyploidization or autopolyploidization, are a major force for plant diversification. Because the cytoplasmic genomes are separately replicated (and inherited) from the nuclear genome, the stoichiometric balance between the three genomic compartments (i.e., cytonuclear stoichiometry) is expected to be perturbed following WGD. Recent work indicates that cytonuclear stoichiometry is maintained following WGD in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that gene dosage balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes represents an important component of polyploid lineage formation and evolution. We therefore hypothesize that cytonuclear stoichiometry is critical for establishing the cell?s chloroplast and mitochondrial content, such that variation in cytonuclear stoichiometry leads to variation in photosynthetic and respiratory performance and that the genomic architecture of cytonuclear stoichiometry is responsive to changes in nuclear genome size and content. First, we will test these hypotheses in diploid, polyploid, and aneuploid contexts by quantifying and measuring organelles, evaluating photosynthetic performance, and comparing nuclear vs. cytoplasmic transcript pools of single cells. We will also perform association tests in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and confirm those associations with molecular knockouts to disentangle the complex genomic architecture underlying cytonuclear stoichiometry. The findings are expected to set the stage for future applied efforts aimed at improving metabolic function in polyploid crops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does the brain work remain one of the most challenging scientific problems for humanity. For decades, scientists and engineers continually develop and refine new methods and techniques to advance our understanding of the brain. Out of these tools, imaging is essential for deciphering the brain because it allows us to directly visualize and investigate the complex brain tissues and their organizations and functional networks. However, even with the multitude of brain imaging technologies that are currently available, our ability to probe deep brain tissues beyond the cerebral cortex is still limited. This limitation can largely be attributed to the physics of imaging, which dictate the inevitable trade-off between how small of an object we can see and from how deep we can see them. This shortcoming ultimately limits our ability to explore beyond the superficial tissues of the brain and to understand how the human brain works in its entirety. The long-term objective of this CAREER proposal, therefore, is to overcome this shortcoming by developing a new ultrasound imaging technology that can probe deep brain functional neural activities at a microscopic spatial resolution. Our technique leverages the power of deep learning and ultrafast ultrasound imaging to break the barrier of imaging speed for conventional super-resolution ultrasound. If successful, this transformative new technology will become a paradigm-shifting imaging tool that provides functional brain mapping at a much finer spatial resolution with a much deeper and wider territory than ever before. The unique capabilities of this new imaging technology will also open new doors for many under-explored opportunities in both basic neuroscience research and in many neurological disease applications. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop a new and transformative functional brain imaging technology that allows continuous, real-time monitoring of neural activities of the entire brain at a micron-scale through intact skull. Thrust 1 will focus on improving the temporal resolution of conventional super-resolution ultrasound imaging by developing deep learning-based super-resolution imaging techniques. Thrust 2 will address the computational challenges associated with ultrasound image reconstruction by developing a new ultrafast ultrasound system based on modern high-speed FPGAs. Thrust 3 will concentrate on developing phase aberration correction methods based on deep learning and novel 3D ultrafast imaging techniques to achieve robust intact skull imaging of the whole brain. In vivo mouse brain imaging studies will be conducted throughout the technical thrusts to evaluate and validate the performance of the newly developed super-resolution imaging techniques. If successful, the proposed work will result in a new, radiation-free, low-cost, and widely accessible functional brain imaging technique that will be the first to enable noninvasive probing of in vivo, deep-brain neural activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the technical thrusts, this CAREER proposal also includes educational and outreach programs aimed to instill in the new generation of students the desire to improve the standard of healthcare such that all patients have access to state-of-the-art treatment, diagnostic, and screening options. By providing research opportunities, creating ultrasound engineering labs, developing innovative teaching strategies, and establishing new courses, this CAREER proposal will provide these students with the knowledge and tools necessary to create actionable changes within the opportunities presented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insects, in particular, have repeatedly formed symbioses with microbes for metabolism, nutrition, and protection. Insect immune systems are tasked with the challenge of controlling and regulating beneficial microbes while combating often closely-related pathogenic microbes. A critical unanswered question is whether the insect immune system is a key mediator of both symbionts and pathogens across different host species. This project will combine cutting edge genomics with experimental manipulations that will link immune responses with symbiont associations across diverse host species. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how immune systems interact with symbionts is not only critical for understanding the evolution of host-associated microbiomes, it also has relevance to the invertebrate pests that vector devastating diseases of crops, livestock, and humans. In addition, there are research opportunities available for undergraduate students to train the next generation of STEM researchers.<br/><br/>This project will use aphids as a model system and involves research at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and the Queen Mary University of London. Aphids are uniquely suited for this work because they have strong non-random associations with microbial symbionts: a symbiont species may be common in one aphid species, yet rarely found in a close relative. This suggests a dynamic interplay between host and microbe that can drive symbiont spread or loss over relatively short evolutionary timescales. Preliminary data has shown that hosting certain symbionts leads to a sharp decrease in the expression of key immune genes in aphids. This suggests host immunity is of central importance to the evolution of symbiotic relationships. The primary objective of this project is to use transcriptome sequencing and immune assays to test the hypothesis that host immune suppression is a key mechanism explaining the distribution of symbiotic microbes across aphid species. A secondary objective is to determine whether there is a trade-off in the ability to harbor symbionts and resist pathogens across species. Genomes of virulent and non-virulent symbiont strains will also be compared using a novel symbiont culturing technology to identify genetic features that underlie pathogenicity in symbiotic microbes. Together, this cross-species approach will transform our understanding of how host immunity moderates relationships with symbiotic microbes. This project will thus provide key insight into how invertebrates form and maintain relationships with microbes that can drive rapid adaptive evolution in species of central importance to food security and health.

This work plans to address two significant issues in robotics education. Central focus areas of the project include addressing the difficulty of finding qualified robotics instructors and reducing learning and instructional barriers related to the expense of robotics training equipment. College students studying robotics have a variety of backgrounds, learning styles, and goals. Some students have significant industry experience and return to school to learn a specific skill, while others have never taken any college courses. The resulting framework is intended to allow students to tailor their educational experience to meet their needs and background. The framework will also allow students to learn robotics using low-cost hardware and will not require instructors with extensive robotics expertise to deliver course content. The deployment of this system has the potential to increase the number of degree programs in robotics at both community colleges and four-year undergraduate institutions. Additionally, leveraging low-cost devices and simulation has potential to increase access to high-quality robotics instruction. <br/><br/>The project will implement a learning system in two one-semester courses covering robotics topics that make extensive use of low-cost hardware and high-realism simulators. The student-centered personalized learning framework will prioritize student autonomy and be used to teach students advanced robotics skills. Course topics will be selected based on advice from a course content advisory committee. After the learning system is developed, the course content will be integrated into the platform. User studies will be conducted to determine the depth at which students master the desired learning outcomes and their experiences using the system. The system will be deployed and evaluated at Lenoir Community College and the University of Nevada Reno.

These lasers are configured to produce periodically stationary pulses by propagating light many times around a loop. Although different physical effects change the shape of the pulse as it traverses the loop, the pulse returns to the same shape once each period (round trip). A significant challenge for the modeling of these lasers is that from one generation to the next there has been a dramatic increase in the amount by which the pulse breathes, necessitating novel mathematical approaches. This project will develop theoretical and computational methods to determine periodically stationary pulse solutions of nonlinear wave equations modeling laser systems and to analyze their stability (robustness in the presence of random noise and other system perturbations). The project will provide computational tools to aid in the design of high energy lasers for medical applications, and of frequency combs for highly accurate measurements of time and frequency, with applications to geo-location systems, time and frequency standards, the calibration of astronomical instruments, and trace gas sensing. The project will provide broad training in applied mathematics for doctoral students and mentoring for junior faculty. In addition, the project will support complementary activity focused on pedagogical innovations. <br/> <br/>The laser models to be studied in this project are based on variants of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Classically, the spectrum of a stationary nonlinear wave is given by the zero set of the Evans function of the linearized differential operator. The stability of periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of fiber lasers will be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the monodromy operator of the linearization about the pulse. Since the stability problem for time-periodic solutions is formulated on a cylinder, rather than on the real line, any generalization of the Evans function will involve Fredholm determinants of operators on infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than classical determinants of matrices. To avoid the extreme stiffness of the differential equations used to compute the Evans function in this infinite dimensional context, the point spectrum of the monodromy operator will be identified with the zero set of an infinite-dimensional Fredholm determinant of a Birman-Schwinger operator on an infinite cylinder. Numerical methods will be developed to compute Fredholm determinants of such Birman-Schwinger operators. These methods will then be employed to determine stability regions in design parameter space for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of experimental fiber laser systems. The generic instability of stationary solutions of reaction diffusion equations has recently been established by applying a related topological invariant called the Maslov index to the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. A novel version of the Maslov index will be used to establish general stability results for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also essential for further analysis to fix the bug. Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires not only input data but also the interleaving order of system calls. Manually reproducing this type of bug from bug reports is challenging due to its elusive nature and the need for supplementary details. Moreover, bug reports composed in natural language are frequently unstructured, posing a challenge when it comes to extracting essential information. Existing bug reproduction tools are incompatible with this type of bug due to their inability to deal with the specific interleaving schedule at the system call level. To address these challenges and improve the efficiency of reproducing these bugs from bug reports, a novel framework named RepSON will be developed. It will lessen the manual burden of the software developers to debug system-level concurrency bugs that happen frequently in modern software systems. Furthermore, this project will develop a technique for extracting information and generating executable inputs from bug reports that can also be applied to other types of software bugs.<br/><br/>The technical goals of the project are divided into two major tasks. First, an empirical study will be conducted on open-source bug repositories to identify system-level concurrency bug reports and summarize their characteristics for guiding the automated debugging process. Second, an automated framework RepSON will be developed for reproducing bugs in multi-process applications by analyzing bug reports. Natural language processing, data mining, and dynamic program analysis techniques will be employed in the development of RepSON. It will take a bug report as input and reproduce the associated bug by generating input and instrumentation location. To achieve this, RepSON will analyze the bug report to generate the input script and extract system call names that may cause the bug. Subsequently, it will run the program, collect the system call trace to identify potential buggy interleaving, and instrument the code to run it again and reproduce the bug.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The demanding challenge in this field is to find the right carrier architecture and the optimum polymer chemistry that can facilitate controlled delivery and release of therapeutic agents (drugs) to their targets. A unique carrier is invertible polymer micellar assemblies, which are formed by the rapid self-organization/assembly of polymers with alternated and repeated hydrophobic (water-hating) and hydrophilic (water-loving) segments in a rod-like shape (tens of nanometers long). Drugs and polypeptides/nucleic acids which can treat various diseases but cannot be directly introduced to human body can be incorporated into invertible micellar assemblies. Once the environmental conditions are changed (i.e., when the assemblies from water ?arrive? to the cellular membrane), the invertible micellar assemblies reverse their dimensions and geometry (shape) in a smart way to effectively deliver and release cargo molecules to the targets (biological membranes) and, thus, treat relevant diseases. Although the structure and dynamics of invertible micellar assemblies have been understood to a certain level, the key questions that still need to be answered are (i) what properties of cargo-loaded invertible micellar assemblies make them efficient in treating diseases (ii) how significant is a fact of unique change of shape (called ?inversion? in this project) for efficient delivery performance. Answering these questions require an in-depth understanding on the interactions between drug cargos and invertible micellar assemblies under varied environments at the molecular level, which is a challenging task because most commonly seen techniques do not have a sufficiently high resolution to ?penetrate? the assemblies and probe biopolymer cargos therein. In this project, researchers from the North Dakota State University bridge this knowledge gap by labelling biopolymers and studying the behavior of the labeled sites using a unique technique known as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The obtained data will provide details on how invertible micellar assemblies interact with the solvent environment and the biopolymer cargos as well as how the cargos move and/or aggregate within the interior of invertible micellar assemblies. This information  not only answers aforementioned questions but also assists in the rational design of new delivery vehicles that better adapt/deliver biopolymers and/or drugs, broadening the application of invertible micellar assemblies as general drug carriers to treat various diseases. The research team will provide training to underrepresented students including Native American students and local undergraduate and high school students on nanotechnology and chemistry. The team will also offer scientific educational opportunities for youths whose parents are deployed as soldiers through the Operation Military Kids program in the state of North Dakota.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the interactions among the invertible micellar assemblies, cargo, and environment (solvent) at the nanoscale, in order to reveal the mechanistic details in the interior of invertible micellar assemblies when biopolymer cargos are loaded and released due to environment polarity changes. This goal will be achieved via three steps: (i) revealing the changes in the morphology, crowding, and polarity of invertible micellar assemblies under varied solvent conditions, (ii) depicting the impact of biopolymer cargo loading on the morphology, crowding, and polarity of invertible micellar assemblies in water, and (iii) elucidating the movement and aggregation state (if any) of the biopolymer within invertible micellar assemblies upon environment polarity change. The key to acquiring this knowledge is to covalently place an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spin probe/tag at specific locations/positions within the invertible micellar assemblies and on biopolymers, followed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy study of (bio)polymer structure and dynamics. This research will provide maps of the local crowding and polarity within the invertible micellar assemblies under various solvent conditions and locate various segments of biopolymer cargos (connecting which lead to cargo conformation) in the invertible micellar assemblies based on the local crowding and polarity of the cargo. The obtained knowledge offers a direct connection between the microenvironment of invertible micellar assemblies and cargo structure/hydrophobicity/polarity to assess and rationalize the relative strength of the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. This work will also use the information of cargo location and cargo movement to depict the relative position of cargos upon interacting with the invertible micellar assemblies. Lastly, this research will elucidate the possible structural changes of cargos, if any, caused by the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. All of these efforts will result in an in-depth understanding of the cargo uptake/release performance and the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. This project will also provide training to students at various educational levels (high school, undergraduate) from diverse backgrounds by offering hands-on research experience in cutting-edge nanotechnology, biopolymer engineering, and spectroscopy. The obtained knowledge and experimental approaches from research activities will be disseminated through scientific peer-review journal publications, national/international conferences, and local science fairs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will a recently developed platform that creates confined space at sizes similar to typical proteins, and use modern spectroscopic methods to examine protein structure and dynamics.  These studies will be used to generate a systematic understanding on how spatial confinement impacts the protein structure-function relationship. This project will improve the communication and collaboration of next generation scientists in North Dakota by through a summer student research exchange program between North Dakota State University and the United Tribes Technical College.

Lastly, the project will stimulate the interest in science for local elementary school students.<br/><br/>This project will determine the influence of the size, shape, and boundary properties of spatial confinement on protein structure, dynamics, and function. This project will employ the recently developed MOFs/COFs to create systematically confined spaces that differ in size, shape, and boundary properties, respectively. The loading conditions of two model proteins, lysozyme and the human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), will be optimized separately in order to optimize their loading capacity.

Graph analysis has been central for multiple communities, including the classical graph theory community, network analysis, graph optimization, as well as the modern day graph learning communities. Traditionally, graphs are regarded as purely combinatorial objects. However, as applications of graphs proliferate, they tend to be regarded as much richer structures. For example, a graph might be viewed as a noisy skeleton of a hidden geometric domain, and there could be rich, complex data associated with its nodes or edges. While this viewpoint is not new, existing algorithmic treatments of graphs have not yet fully leveraged this perspective. In this project, the investigators aim to further integrate various (geo)metric and topological perspectives into graph analysis in order to enrich graph analysis algorithms and broaden the range of methodologies one can use to tackle diverse graph related tasks. This project will integrate ideas and notions from metric geometry, applied topology, spectral geometry and also algorithms to develop new perspectives and effective methods to analyze complex graphs. It will inject new ideas to graph analysis and learning, while at the same time also advancing the field of geometric and topological data analysis. Given the ubiquity of graphs data, methods resulting from this project can potentially impact various application fields, from scientific domains such as molecular biology, materials science, neuroscience, to engineering domains such as chip design. Results from this project will be integrated into the data science curriculum, strengthening the workforce by training undergraduates and graduates in data science.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigators will consider a range of important problems related to the study of individual as well as of collections of graphs. A central theme of this project is to view graphs as objects enriched beyond their combinatorial structures. Two specific research thrusts that the investigators will focus on are: (1) various graph distances, trade-offs between their discriminating power and computational complexity, and potential applications in graph sparsification and in the study of graph neural networks; and (2) modeling, recovering and using (potentially higher order) structures in graphs. To tackle the challenges emerging from these two research thrusts, the investigators will use various metric and topological methods. Examples include viewing graphs as metric spaces and bringing in topological tools (e.g., the interleaving distance from applied topology) to compare them; viewing graphs as metric measure spaces so as to use optimal transport ideas; and bringing together topological persistence through the high dimensional Laplace operator to study spectral structures induced by graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, in climate simulations, scientists are interested in identifying, verifying, and evaluating trends in detecting, tracking, and characterizing weather patterns associated with high impact weather events such as thunderstorms and hurricanes. In recent years, topological data analysis (TDA) has evolved as an emerging area in data science. So far, most of its applications have been limited to the single parameter case, that is, to data expressing the behavior of a single variable. As its reach to applications expands, the task of extracting intelligent summaries out of diverse, complex data demands the study of multiparameter dependencies. This project will help address this demand by developing a sound mathematical theory supported by efficient algorithmic tools thus providing a powerful platform for data exploration and analysis in scientific and engineering applications. The educational impact will be accelerated by the synergy between mathematics and computer science and integrated applications. Graduate students supported by the project will be trained to develop skills in mathematics and theoretical computer science, most notably in algorithms and topology, and analyze some real-world data sets. The investigators will follow best practice to recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups who will participate in the project. The investigators also plan to broaden research engagement via workshops or tutorials at computational topology and TDA venues. <br/><br/>Although TDA involving a single parameter has been well researched and developed, the same is not yet true for the multiparameter case. At its current nascent stage, multiparameter TDA is yet to develop tools to practically handle complex, diverse, and high-dimensional data. To meet this challenge, this project will make both mathematical and algorithmic advances for multiparameter TDA. To scope effectively, focus will be mainly on three research thrusts to: (I) explore multiparameter persistence for generalized features and develop algorithms to compute them; (II) exploit the connections of zigzag persistence to multiparameter settings to support dynamic data analysis, and (III) generalize graphical topological descriptors. From a methodological point of view, the geometric and topological ideas behind the proposed work inject novel perspectives and directions to the important field of computational data analysis. In particular, the project team will investigate several novel mathematical concepts in conjunction with algorithms to address various challenges appearing in the aforementioned thrusts. The resulting TDA methodologies have the potential to complement and augment traditional data analysis approaches in fields such as machine learning and statistical data analysis. The investigators bring together expertise in theoretical computer science, algorithms design, mathematics, and in particular topological data analysis to conduct this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to fire safety concerns, flame retardant chemicals are traditionally added to reduce fire-risk. However, they can weaken composites and can be toxic, causing hazards when using and recycling the polymer matrix composites. Preliminary experiments indicated novel fire retardant and resistant properties can be engineered into carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites with a nanostructure-modification during manufacturing process rather than relying on flame retardant chemical additives. In this research project, the nanostructure?s active, passive, and interactive roles in inhibiting the mechanisms of smoke generation and matrix burning will be studied and understood. By utilizing the new knowledge in next generation polymer composites in a fire event, the novel fire resistant and retardant mechanisms could protect the integrity of the advanced nanostructured composite without using harmful chemical flame retardants. As a result, this new composite will be difficult-to-ignite, will self-fire-extinguish, produce less smoke, and retain a substantial amount of mechanical load-bearing capability during and after fires. A scalable manufacturing process for the advanced nanostructured carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites will also be developed. The success of this project will benefit human society with an innovative lightweight polymer matrix composite technology and scientific knowledge for breakthrough in functionality, safety, and sustainability. Commercialization potential will be fostered through communication with governmental and industrial stakeholders as well as through the training of students for next-generation entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>This project will conduct tasks to understand the fire retardant and resistant behaviors due to the advanced nanostructured carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites and use such knowledge to better design and manufacture the next generation composites. These tasks will address how the nanostructured composite, without any harmful flame-retardant chemical additives, during a fire, will be able to maintain its integrity, prevent char loss, withstand internal vapor-bursting-pressure, prevent volatile vapor release, and quench local hot spots. Therefore, it will inhibit the polymer?s thermal decomposition process to withstand significantly higher temperatures, inhibit combustible volatiles from contacting and reacting with oxygen in the air, and mitigate risks associated with smoke, fire, and structural failure/collapse.

Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize safety as a fundamental aspect across various domains of AI research. Notably, due to the ubiquity of network (graph) data, network learning techniques have strongly impacted AI in the past decade, being widely deployed across applications such as social networks, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, real-world networks often include challenges like data issues and unforeseen environmental hazards, resulting in risky AI techniques and unsafe outcomes when these networks are employed. Existing studies for safe network learning lack versatility, efficiency, and comprehensive integration across multiple safety dimensions. They struggle to ensure timely, safe predictions in practical scenarios and fail to holistically address data, model, and usage aspects. These challenges collectively hinder their capability and effectiveness, and there is currently a lack of a holistic framework to adequately tackle safety issues in network learning. To bridge this research gap, the goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a novel Safety-centric Network Learning framework (SNL) for safe decision-making on networks in the wild. The project outcomes will substantially impact network learning research and offer advanced solutions to address challenges across diverse domains such as public health, cybersecurity, and social media. Additionally, the project will foster interdisciplinary collaborations and facilitate technology transfer to industry. The project outcomes will be made publicly accessible and broadly disseminated. Moreover, the project will integrate research with education through novel curriculum development and student mentoring activities with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, aiming to train and educate future generations in effectively developing and utilizing AI while also ensuring AI safety. <br/><br/>The project will involve comprehensive efforts to develop SNL that prioritizes the critical safety dimensions of reliability, stability, and explainability, and further encompasses the crucial aspects of data, model, and usage in a general, efficient, and integrated manner. Formally, SNL will provide reliable network data and network learning models (reliability) while generating stable and consistent outputs (stability) accompanied by easily understandable usage explanations (explainability). Specifically, the research components that engage innovative theories, algorithms, and models in this project are fourfold. First, design novel network learning algorithms to identify and generate reliable network data that are minimally impacted by data and environmental issues. Second, create new network representation learning models and training strategies to promote efficiency and reliability in learning network representations. Third, devise innovative data-to-model optimization theories to ensure the stability of network learning. Finally, develop novel generative learning methods to advance the usage explainability and output receptivity of network learning. The unified framework allows seamless collaboration and mutual reinforcement among different research components. Through the convergent research program, the project will not only make significant advancements in network learning and AI safety research but also shed novel insights to tackle various societal challenges, ultimately benefiting society at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful tool for metabolomics due to its excellent analytical reproducibility and ability to detect numerous metabolites in a single measurement. NMR metabolomics is conventionally performed on a high-field (HF) spectrometer, but the recent development of benchtop spectrometers has led to a resurgence of interest in low-field (LF) NMR due to its accessibility, low cost and small footprint compared to HF. NMR metabolomics at both HF and benchtop LF, however, require time-consuming, user-dependent processing and expertise for metabolite identification and quantification. Due to these limitations, both HF and LF NMR are underexplored for metabolomics research in the biological community. This project will fill these critical gaps by developing, validating, and disseminating real-time, high-throughput NMR metabolomic techniques for both HF and benchtop LF NMR for advancing biological infrastructure and research. This interdisciplinary project will prepare the next generation of women and minorities to pursue bioengineering and bioinformatics career?currently an under-represented discipline. The project will also integrate research with educational objectives to target the broader community from K?12 to graduate students and the general public: (a) coursework to strengthen biosignal processing & analysis skills in undergraduate and graduate curricula; (b) internships, targeted to talented women, minority, and low-income college students; (c) hands-on STEM projects to motivate high-schoolers through collaboration with school teachers; (d) disseminate bioengineering research to support K?12 learning through the Society of Women Engineers, West TN STEM Hub, and Girls Experiencing Engineering programs; and (e) educational exhibits at local museums to enable public outreach and exposure to NMR applications. This early hands-on exposure will benefit students of all ages to understand fundamental concepts and realize NMR applications in a broad range of fields?including molecular biology, biomedical engineering and chemical engineering?and ultimately motivate them to pursue a STEM career. <br/><br/>The project will develop, validate, and disseminate open-access metabolomic techniques that will automatically quantify the metabolites in complex biological spectra obtained from high-field (HF) and benchtop low-field (LF) NMR via the following objectives: 1) investigate high-throughput metabolomic methods for HF NMR using deep learning, 2) reconstruct high-resolution and high-throughput spectra from benchtop LF NMR using autoencoder, 3) investigate these techniques for inquiring biological questions, and 4) disseminate metabolomic libraries and techniques for biological research and education via an open-access software.

Thus, the inability to self-report pain makes babies vulnerable to under- and over-treatment of pain. The investigators created and pediatric nurses validated, a preliminary artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered pain classification model based on facial actions from a video dataset of newborn pain.

How do they cause damage?  What causes some tornadoes to be intense and others weaker?  How can we build better to reduce the risks from tornadoes?  Observations in and near tornadoes are needed to better answer these questions. But, observations very near the ground, where people live, and inside tornadoes are very rare since they are difficult to predict and even harder to observe.  Some, rare, observations show that tornado winds can exceed 300 mph, and that the most intense winds are very near the ground, where they are especially hard to measure.  In order to mitigate the hazards posed by tornadoes, it is critical to better understand their basic structure and intensity.  The Boundary-layer Evolution and Structure of Tornadoes (BEST) project will address some of these questions, deploying mobile radars, Tornado Pods, and SwarmSonde balloons in and near tornadoes.  The goal is to resolve tornado structure, evolution, the intensity of winds, and the temperatures and humidities near tornadoes that likely affect how intense they are.  BEST will also examine decades of mobile radar and other data collected in and near tornadoes to better understand how strong, large, and potentially damaging they are.<br/><br/>BEST is a multi-focus study of tornado structure and evolution.  BEST plans a field phase during which unprecedentedly-fine scale kinematic and thermodynamic data will be collected by proximately-deployed DOW radars, Tornado Pods, and SwarmSonde lagrangian drifter balloons.  Dual-DOW baselines of 3-6 km will allow, for the first time, integrated mapping of tornado vector wind structures combined with detailed thermodynamic mapping provided with the densely-deployed Tornado Pods and SwarmSondes.  BEST will compare these new data with a unique database of DOW wind measurements over 200 unique tornadoes.  Approximately 20 of these include dual-Doppler vector wind resolving data.  One includes data from an extremely fortuitous 3 km - baseline dual-DOW deployment near a very large multi-vortex tornado, with dual-Doppler data uniquely resolving the structure and evolution of sub-tornado vortices.  A critical aspect of BEST is the combination of single-case study analysis of rare or very fortuitously observed events, with broader statistical analysis of several to over 200 events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The SciWiT project plans to implement a prototype system for performing scientific data analysis using in-network and near-network resources in an optimal way.<br/><br/>Many scientific workflows continuously monitor a phenomenon in search for rare events. This process generates enormous amount of data; thus, researchers rely on change detection algorithms to locate the rare event information.

While data is still in transit, network identifies the regions of interest from the data stream and to provide feedback to the instrument.

However, the increasing digitization of ICSs, involving sensing, communication, and control, brings advanced features but also exposes vulnerabilities to malicious cyber-attacks. Protecting ICSs from such attacks is crucial due to the potential catastrophic physical damages they can cause. The project aims to develop a comprehensive solution, integrating human-on-the-loop explainable machine learning (ML), detection, and recovery control in an operator-automation shared protection framework, to provide security and safety-assured ICSs against malicious cyber-attacks. Moreover, the project will incorporate engineering research and education to train students, particularly those from Under-Represented Minorities (URM), and cultivate a diverse, globally competitive cybersecurity workforce. With the goal of lowering barriers to ICSs security research and education, this project aims to have a significant impact by providing accessible testbeds for a diverse population of beginning and expert cybersecurity students and engineers to learn and practice.<br/><br/>The underlying concept of process anomaly detection, which is used for detecting cyber-attacks, involves comparing observed and expected behaviors based on physical invariants. The data-driven approach has the advantage of automatically discovering these physical invariants without requiring domain expertise. However, existing approaches based on black-box Machine Learning (ML) often overlook the role of system operators in safety-critical ICSs. The lack of insightful explanations in detection results hinders system operators from conducting troubleshooting and isolating anomalous sensors and actuators under attack, which is necessary for scheduling online recovery. To address this issue, the PI's team proposes to develop an operator-automation shared protection framework that unifies human-on-the-loop explainable ML, detection, and recovery control. This framework aims to enable real-time decision-making using cutting-edge ML and control techniques while valuing the feedback of human operators to prevent over-trust in autonomy in a safety-critical system. The research project has three major objectives: 1) The PI's team will develop insightful hybrid automata learning that captures physical invariants in a way that system operators can understand the model and the detection results, verify and correct the model, and localize anomalies; 2) A real-time provably safe control under uncertainty will be designed to restore the system to normal operation without violating safety constraints; and 3) the PI?s team will evaluate, demonstrate, and disseminate best practices of the proposed framework on 3D simulated and real testbeds with portability across a wide range of ICSs for lowering the barriers to ICSs security research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viability is the ability of a system to autonomously maintain itself or recover functionality after an adverse critical event and is a desired feature of robust intelligence and autonomy. An example of a critical event is a robot landing upside down and being unable to stand up without an external assistance. Other examples are an unmanned underwater vehicle in an unrecoverable state, a robotic arm getting stuck in clutter, or a car with poor braking performance due to a mechanical failure. The principal objective of this project is to develop a framework for the design of viable (self-recoverable) artificial agents. The main challenge is to formulate a metric for viability that can be calculated for various scenarios. This metric needs to be computable from the motor and sensor readings. The first task of this project is to develop an effective metric for agent viability from the essential properties of control systems, along with computationally efficient methods for its calculation. The second task is to demonstrate the applicability of this framework for useful problems in (i) self-recovery of walking robots and (ii) self-maintenance of car brakes. This project not only advances the understanding of robot viability, but also proposes new machine-learning approaches for control and analysis of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>To achieve its goals, this project will extend the classical notion of Lyapunov exponents towards ?Agent-Induced Lyapunov Exponents?, AILE, which prioritize states with diverse potentialities, and with a large space of effectively controllable states. AILE allows artificial agents to train autonomously, maintaining themselves or recovering capabilities without the need for problem-specific externally provided reward functions. Computational methods will be developed for the calculation of the AILE metric with known and unknown dynamics, and with partially and fully observable state. This capacity will allow for the broad applicability of the framework. It will be demonstrated in two transformative applications: self-recovery of locomotion agents, and control of chaotic ?stick-slip? friction in car brakes. This project is not framed along the lines of traditional disciplinary boundaries, but rather bridges between machine learning, dynamical systems, mechanics, and information theory. This project will open doors to new research directions and technology for fully-autonomous agents with an enormous potential for replacing and/or assisting humans in risky situations, such as driving.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate.

However, providing these services is challenging due to the extreme and changing climate, as well as the remote nature of hub communities and Alaska Native villages. We do not currently understand how CISs are interconnected in Arctic communities; however, we do know that these interconnections are sources of both resilience and vulnerability. Furthermore, the different CIS organizations are complex, are responsible for people?s lives and safety, and have characteristics that we must understand further. This project explores how CISs support each other (e.g., increasing broadband in rural Alaska enables telehealth) and create challenges (e.g., local supply chains often delay infrastructure repairs). Unlike most rural communities in the contiguous US, in Alaska, the air service network is denser than the roadway network. In turn, hub communities?i.e., communities that can be reached by commercial airplanes or ports?are critical for surrounding, remote villages as they provide services including delivery of fuel and workforce support. This project considers the interface between urban hub communities and neighboring rural Alaska Native villages, exploring how challenges in hub towns cascade to villages. In collaboration with three hub communities in Alaska, the interdisciplinary research team integrates systems engineering, organizational sciences, civil engineering, and public health to improve the provision of CISs, not only benefiting the towns themselves, but also Alaska Native villages.<br/><br/>This project aims to architect infrastructure interdependencies within hub communities and at the interfaces between urban hubs and rural Alaska Native villages. In doing so, this work paves the way for future research by providing new empirical data and creating a set of management approaches that can help communities immediately improve their CISs. Leveraging semi-structured interviews with CIS stakeholders, operational data collection, and collaborative stakeholder workshops, Phase 1 of the project identifies and maps CIS interdependencies in hub towns. This phase uses fuzzy cognitive mapping and causal loop diagrams to bring together stakeholders? expertise and perspectives. Phase 2 analyzes how the provision of CISs in hub towns cascade to neighboring villages by assessing end-users? perceptions towards their infrastructure services and how they use services in hub towns.

Given its high prevalence, there is a need for an automatic and scalable method to inform diagnosis and behavioral therapies. While prior work on finding early-emerging and reliable quantitative biomarkers of ASD has focused on non-motor features, abundant research evidence has revealed patterns of impaired motor imitation in a wide range of children with ASD, making motor imitation deficits a promising avenue to find a phenotypic biomarker. However, traditional imitation assessment methods often rely on expert-based observation, which is costly, time-consuming and error-prone, and lacks objectivity and scalability. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning make artificial intelligence a promising technology to design an objective, reproducible and highly-scalable multimodal system functioning not only in well-equipped clinical setups but also at home for assessing imitation performance in children with ASD. However, critical challenges such as the design of specific imitation tasks for ASD assessment, the collection and labeling of multimodal data for training machine learning algorithms, and the development of novel fine-grained representations human movements and metrics for comparing such movements need to be addressed to test the validity, scalability and reproducibility of automatic motor imitation assessment algorithms to inform ASD diagnosis.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to design, develop and test an objective, reproducible and highly-scalable multimodal system to observe children performing a brief video game-like motor imitation task, quantitatively assess their motor imitation performance, and investigate its validity as a phenotypic biomarker for autism. Accomplishing this goal will require an interdisciplinary approach which combines expertise in autism, child development, computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, this project will: (1) design motor imitation tasks that are relevant for ASD assessment, (2) design, test and validate a scalable and flexible system to collect and label multimodal data of children imitating a sequence of movements; (3) design a novel fine-grained representation of human movements that can be learned efficiently and is suitable for comparing the children's movements to the movements they need to imitate; (4) develop novel computer vision and metric learning algorithms for learning and comparing multimodal representations of human movements, and (5) use such metrics to generate candidate imitations scores that can be used as potential quantitative biomarkers for ASD. The motor imitation assessment methods to be developed in this project could be used in a wide variety of applications beyond assessing children with ASD, such as providing imitation performance scores for video-based rehabilitation therapy, surgical skill assessment, athletic activities and other movement-based instructional activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the wide availability of data from these systems, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have found great success in many CPS applications. However, their current fundamental challenges are that they often require big data, may violate basic physical principles leading to underperformance or even failures, and do not robustly handle messy data from real-life systems. This project creates new methods, algorithms, and software in a cyberinfrastructure (CI) that seamlessly and synergistically integrate ML/AI with traditional physical knowledge in so-called physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models that can overcome these challenges. The CI is built upon a unified theoretical foundation of PIML, a framework and software for composing heterogeneous models into composite PIML models, and novel methods for improving their efficiency and accuracy. The developed technologies will push forward the frontiers of ML/AI in CPSs to open up new exciting pathways for overcoming the inherent challenges and enhancing the performance and safety of AI-driven CPSs, thus broadening their real-life applications. This project deeply integrates research activities with education activities to excite and foster experiential learning and research experience in computer science and engineering at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and to promote STEM participation among underrepresented groups and enrich public understanding through collaboration with local schools and public programs. The project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science, and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to integrate ML and physics within a comprehensive, flexible, and synergistic CI for composite PIML and active learning of dynamic systems. To this end, its objectives are to develop (1) a theoretical foundation of unified PIML frameworks; (2) a theoretical framework and software for composing models and physical properties in composite PIML models; and (3) physics-informed active learning methods which directly integrate physics to obtain the most informative data consistent with physics for improving the sample efficiency and accuracy of learning. This research advances the state of knowledge regarding unification of PIML methods, the benefits and costs of PIML, how to effectively and efficiently compose models and physical properties in a heterogeneous PIML model, and how to integrate physical properties into active learning. It also creates methodologies and software that enable rapid development and exploration of novel data-driven modeling methods for dynamic systems, pushing the limits and enhancing the applicability and performance of ML in CPSs. By building a solid foundation for integrating physics and ML to yield accurate, interpretable, robust, and physically consistent models, the CI will facilitate high-performance data-driven prediction, simulation, optimization, and control methods for CPSs, benefiting a broad range of scientific and engineering applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 60 million years ago the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) moved over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes. The OJP is the largest volcanic structure on Earth. This project will sample seamounts on top of the OJP to study the interactions between plumes and the overlying large and thick OJP. Early-career scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students will take part in the cruise. In port the science team will lead ship tours for local public schools and media. While at sea the PIs will make a training video that outlines how to prepare for and carry out a successful cruise. <br/><br/>Recent work offers tantalizing hints that the currently active Samoan hotspot may be a long-lived mantle melting anomaly, or hotspot, that has been active since the Cretaceous. Many of the 87 to 106 Ma volcanoes in the Magellan Seamount Chain, located north of the OJP, have Samoan hotspot geochemical signatures. Critically, their ages and locations match predictions for the Samoan hotspot made using absolute plate motion reconstructions. The implications for identifying a Cretaceous segment (87-106 Ma) of the Samoan hotspot are profound. First, using the same plate motion models, reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot show that the OJP passed over the Samoan plume at ~60-30 Ma, and over the Rarotonga plume?a second, possibly-long-lived hotspot?at ~60-50 Ma. Second, passage of the extraordinarily thick OJP lithosphere over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes would have resulted in lower degree plume melts with stronger enriched mantle (EM) signatures than anywhere else along the Samoan and Rarotonga hotspot tracks. The hypothesized relationship between thicker lithosphere and stronger EM signatures is supported by the Cretaceous Samoa-related Magellan Seamounts, which exhibit a robust relationship between older (and therefore thicker) lithosphere and stronger EM signatures. A 43-day seagoing dredging expedition to sample the seamounts along the modeled traces of these two hotspot tracks on top of the OJP will test whether the OJP passed over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes, and whether this resulted in generation of extreme EM melts. A combination of geochemical analyses and 40Ar/39Ar ages will uniquely identify contributions from these two hotspots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project called MEDUSA: Mid-band Environmental sensing capability for Detecting incUmbents during Spectrum shAring is to detect the presence of static/mobile radar and anomalous transmissions within concurrent and comparatively higher power 5G and 4G-LTE signals. It achieves this through machine learning (reacting to existing interference) and receiver antenna design (proactively avoiding interference). MEDUSA will enable ESC sensors to work with different types of wireless signals, both for individual spectrum monitoring and via collaborative methods for enhanced incumbent detection accuracy.

This is most glaring in AI, where our capacity to engineer powerful AI systems has vastly outpaced our capacity to understand them. By building dialogue between the major disciplines studying natural and artificial intelligences, our project will produce a roadmap for Accelerating Research Collaboration on Artificial and Natural Intelligences (ARCANI). To create this roadmap, ARCANI will link several international research networks, drawing on insights and conversations that cross disciplines, career stages, and countries. The integration of these research networks will also help diversify participation in the study of natural and artificial intelligences. It will train a cohort of early career researchers in new ways of doing science and international collaboration. Through the existing Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute, the ARCANI team has an excellent record of fostering collaboration and leadership amongst researchers from underrepresented groups and developing nations. ARCANI allows us to scale up our efforts, improving training, collaboration opportunities, and skill development for young scholars across many disciplines. The ARCANI roadmap will lead to the development of theoretical foundations spanning from animal behavior to AI. It will establish a vibrant trading zone for sharing novel methods, data, and computational frameworks. And it will translate foundational concepts and empirical insights into practical technologies.

With the advent of single cell multi-omics (scMulti-seq) biotechnology, researchers can study the  biological functions of a complex biological system at the cellular resolution. The integrative  analysis of scMulti-seq data and multiple study objects produces a wealth of rich information that enables the characterization of species or tissue specific biological functions, and at the same  time, poses great challenge on how to identify and extract biologically meaningful data patterns. Though substantial amount of efforts has been made to interpret data patterns in single cell multi omics data, most of the existing methods focused on unsupervised learning in a completely data driven manner without considering the rich existing knowledge. In addition, depending on the  types of biological functions, their underlying mathematical representation forms are different in scMulti-seq data. This calls for systems biology models and machine learning concepts to target  true biological functions from scMulti-seq data. The first challenge to study biological functions  from scMulti-seq data is to derive the data patterns that correspond to true biological functions and develop proper computational models for specific biological mechanisms and pathways. The  second challenge lies in the difficulty of knowledge representation and sharing across the studies  for different species, tissue types and experimental conditions. There remains an urgent need to integrate knowledge derived from disparate data sources to optimize the biological functional  modeling, such that the learned knowledge could be utilized to study other biological systems or  data types and promote the generation of new hypotheses. The PI?s long-term career goal is to develop mathematical formulations and computational  methods to model biological functions from multi-omics data. <br/><br/>This project will develop new  mathematical models and an advanced computational framework to optimize the mining of  biological functions, by integrating scMulti-seq data with context specific and general knowledge  derived from independent data sets or experiments. The PI's research team will achieve the goals  through the following three objectives. First, a novel subspace representation model will be  developed to identify transcriptional regulation and functional gene modules. The proposed  method will be empowered by a novel local low-rank matrix detection method to detect gene co regulation modules and a meta-learning framework to optimize results interpretation. Second, the  PI's research team will develop a new graph neural network architecture to estimate cell-wise  functional activities for flux carrying networks and a graph data clustering method to identify cell  groups with varied functional states and distinct pathways. Thirdly, a knowledge graph will be  constructed to represent the biological functions derived from scMulti-seq data, which enables the  integration of independent knowledge derived from literature data and development of new  biological hypotheses. The project is expected to deliver novel computational tools that can  effectively explore biological functions from a wide range of heterogeneous datasets, and it could  provide new capabilities for functional interpretation of individual data sets by maximizing the utilization of existing scMulti-seq and literature data, and reasoning of new biological hypotheses  and mechanisms. Educationally, the scientific discoveries, including developed methods and  biological knowledge, will be seamlessly integrated into an online educational knowledge base  for large-scale public engagement, and will also lead to new project-based interdisciplinary  training for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.

There is a pressing need to replace automotive fossil fuels with renewable fuels. One immediately realizable step in the U.S. is to tap into renewable natural gas of variable grades from biowaste as well as renewable hydrogen from surplus electricity. Low-pressure storage can deliver these fuels to natural gas vehicle operators nationwide, even when off the natural gas grid. This project provides both fundamental insights into low-pressure onboard gas storage and the processes and protocols that permit a system to optimally function on demand both as a fuel storage/delivery system and as a gas separator. The project enables municipalities to use biogas even when they do not have a pipeline-grade renewable natural gas (removal of carbon dioxide) processor or the ability to compress natural gas to fueling-station pressures.  The project also enables communities to market locally produced renewable energy.<br/><br/>The project seeks to develop, demonstrate, and bring to the marketplace a natural gas tank that can be configured as a dual, on-demand gas storage and separation system for storage and delivery of fuels.  The tank will also perform on-board separation of carbon dioxide from low-grade renewable natural gas to generate high-grade renewable natural gas. The gas tank design will fill a critical knowledge gap in the detailed understanding of the adsorption of mixtures into porous materials.  The team proposes to build an experimental, theoretical, and computational framework that will lead to new design principles for optimal storage, delivery, and separation of gases in conditions similar to what is expected in a vehicle. Extensive multi-component 3-dimensional (3D) adsorption isotherm surfaces will be studied experimentally and computationally to obtain performance metrics for different materials and adsorption/desorption cycle paths.  The team also seeks to understand the behavior of co-adsorbing gas mixtures and their interaction with adsorbents. The project seeks to: create laboratory models of gas storage/separation systems by investigating co-adsorption of mixtures producing 3D isotherms, establish kinetic benchmarks for their desorption, identify optimal protocols for gas storage and separation, and demonstrate a system on a prototype automotive tank, including multiple fill/empty/separation cycles, assessing tank regeneration procedures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, challenges remain in bringing these mostly academic findings to the scale necessary for industrial adoption, limiting the benefits to society that would result from safer and milder chemical processing conditions. An important factor in restricting the scalability of photochemical processes is that while high light absorptivity of the feedstocks is desirable for reaction efficiency, it also limits light penetration depth into the reaction medium. Commonly used photocatalysts can also be prohibitively expensive, and residual catalyst impurities in the final products often leads to discoloration or degradation. To address these limitations, this CAREER project will study the use of photocatalyst-coated optical fibers to guide light into the reactor vessels. If successful, the proposed work will lay the scientific foundations to facilitate the implementation of modern photochemistry on an industrial scale and enhance the impact of academic photo-reaction engineering innovations. Immobilizing photocatalysts on optical fibers is anticipated to improve light-penetration and efficiency of the catalytic process. Because the catalysts are immobilized and will not be added continuously with the reactor feed, the proposed approach will improve the process economics and will provide a path to manufacturing both pristine small molecules and polymers free of catalyst impurities. Eliminating such impurities is of importance for synthesis of high purity chemicals in biomedical and electronic applications where trace metals can introduce toxicity or be detrimental to device performance. The research plans have the potential to accelerate the implementation of modern and mild photochemistries on large scales and benefit society by helping to bridge the academia-industry divide. Education and outreach activities will also benefit from the close academia-industry ties to be developed, connecting undergraduate and graduate students and potential employers through field trips and panel discussions with industry leadership. Further, this program will develop and distribute inexpensive polymer science laboratory kits that will benefit underserved middle and high school students by improving access to a quality STEM education experience.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will provide the fundamental engineering knowledge needed to translate academic advances in modern photochemistry to large-scale industrial applications. The objectives of this research program are to identify critical chemical structure-property relationships for organic photoredox catalysts that will enable surface-grafting to immobilizing substrates without affecting catalytic activity. By investigating a range of approaches to control the optical fiber evanescent field, optical fiber surface-tethered catalysts will subsequently be tested as heterogeneous photocatalysts in both batch and continuous-flow reactor systems. Catalyst surface density will be controlled through a combination of surface monolayer grafting and the use of bottlebrush polymer tethers. Once an optimal fiber unit spacing and distribution is identified, process throughput and scalability will no longer limited by light absorption, but exclusively by the size of the reactor. By bringing light into the reactor, Beer-Lambert absorption limitations will be circumvented to provide a highly scalable continuous throughput methodology. Because the photocatalyst is immobilized within the reactor (and not continuously added), it can be recycled for multiple reactions; furthermore, the final chemical product will be free of catalyst impurities, a condition necessary in many pharmaceutical and electronics chemical products. From an educational and outreach perspective, this program will broadly impact students of all ages and backgrounds by forming a coalition between university entities, rural schools, and industrial partners. The principal investigator will increase interfaces between undergraduate and graduate students and potential employers through field trips and panel discussions with industry leadership. Further, this program will pilot and distribute inexpensive at-cost polymer science laboratory kits to secondary students to benefit underserved middle and high school students by improving their access to quality STEM education. Finally, targeted community outreach events will promote university enrollment of socioeconomically challenged students while communicating scientific principles and the importance of sustainability and plastic waste recycling to non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the key enablers to achieve this goal is an energy-efficient and ultra-high-data-rate wireless communication system that matches and, at the same time, scales with the data generation rate. Moreover, wireless communication systems are vulnerable to data intrusion with the increasing number of access networks and nodes in dynamic and open communication environments. This forms a big challenge to wireless cybersecurity. Therefore, to satisfy the needs in the Big Data Era, the next generation wireless communication systems with improved energy efficiency and ultra-high data rate while achieving enhanced security is demanded. The research will develop a new reconfigurable and scalable transceiver phased array system, operating at mm-wave to sub-mm-wave frequencies, to achieve these three objectives. To overcome the many performance challenges at such high frequencies, this project will develop several key enabling and new techniques at different design levels, including system configuration, transceiver architecture, and circuit design. The success of this research will advance scientific understanding and create a new design methodology to achieve unparalleled data rates and energy efficiency, which will broadly impact the wireless industry and benefit the society. Moreover, this project will train future engineers and scientists for the fast-growing data-driven industries, with special efforts to promote diversity by training more female and minority students. <br/><br/>The project will develop a reconfigurable and scalable wireless communication system, operating at mm-wave to sub-mm-wave frequencies, that can be efficiently reconfigured into three operation modes: ultra-high data rate for short distance, high data rate for medium distance, and medium data rate for long distance. The array architecture is based on coupled oscillators for high-efficient frequency tuning and beam forming. The unique tuning scheme allows the array size to be scaled effectively for different operation modes to be deployed in different application scenarios without redesigning the whole system. The new direct antenna modulation scheme enables ultra-high data rates and boosts transmitter energy efficiency by mitigating conventional antenna bandwidth constraints and eliminating linear power amplifiers. And the proposed high gain and low noise mixer structure extracts signal phase information to enable high-order demodulation scheme with enhanced receiver noise and gain performance and reduced power consumption. In addition, the proposed redundancy mapping scheme offers secure wireless communications without extra power and communication overheads. If successful, the system's data rate and energy efficiency will be orders of magnitude higher than existing technologies and therefore the new system will open a new door for secure and ultra-high-speed wireless applications. This project will also investigate the design methodologies on how to achieve the highest frequency/speed with the best energy efficiency systematically, from system and circuit levels down to device level. The transformative design methodologies are expected to benefit other wireless applications, such as radar, imaging, and sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support real-time machine learning and decision making in these applications, a large amount of data has to be transferred from the data source to the destination and processed by an inference algorithm in a timely manner. Traditionally, data transfer and machine learning inference are treated as two separate optimization tasks, but such approaches are inefficient as they ignored the interaction between data transfer and machine learning inference, resulting in either a large data transfer delay or a large inference delay. This CAREER project overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by proposing wireless InferNets, a new wireless network architecture that enables collaborative machine learning inference among network nodes on the data transfer path. The successful completion of this CAREER project will promote the understanding of the synergy between distributed inference and networking, and catalyze a paradigm shift of future wireless networks to support emerging applications and services in security, healthcare and other technological domains. The project also contains a significant educational component and provides abundant opportunities to nurture and attract students, especially from underrepresented groups, to engage in computer science and engineering. <br/><br/>This CAREER project develops models, algorithms and protocols to realize the core functions of wireless InferNets and address challenges caused by network and device heterogeneity, dynamic and imperfect network states, and multiple user contention for the limited resources via three main research aims. Specifically, it aims at (i) developing practical distributed inference routing algorithms and protocols and conducting theoretical analysis to understand the performance limits; (ii) developing new multi-armed bandit algorithms to perform inference routing with uncertain network information; (iii) developing distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms for inference routing in multi-user wireless InferNets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, improving network resiliency, transparency, and cybersecurity have emerged as a national priority. Smart Manufacturing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning show promise in achieving these objectives, yet struggle to materialize at the manufacturing network level. Particularly small and medium-sized manufacturers struggle in their adoption of these data-driven, value added technologies due to a lack of resources and incentives. Consequently, they cannot participate in many high-value manufacturing networks that often require certain technologies and data sharing. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project supports research that intends to address this challenge through a Blockchain-enabled framework that leverages secure and private Federated Learning which meets the unique requirements of defense manufacturing networks. This framework enhances the availability and integrity of critical supplies, as well as strengthens and diversifies the defense industrial base. The project?s secure and privacy-preserving data sharing and collaboration mechanisms can be applied in various domains beyond manufacturing, such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain, empowering individuals and organizations to share data securely and collaborate effectively. The results have potential to transform industry, drive economic growth, foster innovation, and enhance societal well-being. <br/><br/>The project?s research problem stems from manufacturing networks? inability to securely and efficiently exchange data and leverage network level Federated Learning. The project aims to increase the resiliency of distributed and dynamic manufacturing networks, specifically including small and medium-sized manufacturers, by providing access to a secure private Blockchain platform that enables decentralized, secure, and transparent communication channels. This enables manufacturing network level learning through Federated Learning while respecting data ownership and ensuring retention of competitive or controlled (raw) data and machine learning models. To achieve these goals, the project utilizes Federated Learning by integrating a private Blockchain to manage metadata, access controls, and model updates. Unlike existing approaches, the framework focuses on specific challenges and requirements of manufacturing networks. This means ensuring confidential data remains local under full control of the individual nodes while leveraging Blockchain for efficient coordination of the Federated Learning process as well as reducing overhead cost for smaller network participants that are resource constraint. The project advances the state-of-the-art in Federated Learning and Blockchain technology through efficient algorithms for model aggregation and coordination in the presence of heterogeneous data for manufacturing networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Waters from the Pacific flow through Island Southeast Asia as the Indonesian Through-Flow (ITF) and into the western Indian Ocean. Nutrient conditions in the ITF are insufficient to support optimum feeding and growth of SBT larvae, and numerous links between the nutrient cycles and food chain remain unknown. There are very few measurements of both major and trace nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron made in the region.  These nutrients support phytoplankton that form the base of the food chain and affect higher trophic levels, including SBT. This work will investigate the potential sources of major and minor nutrients to the region, including island inputs, Australian dust, monsoon rains, and sedimentary fluxes which will help develop a ?nutrient budget? and reveal which sources contribute the greatest to the success of early SBT life stages. This project is a US contribution to the 2nd International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) that will advance understanding of biogeochemical and ecological dynamics in the poorly studied eastern Indian Ocean. The project will support an early career postdoctoral researcher and outreach activities will include participation in Open House events and REU summer program at home institution.<br/><br/>The ITF can undergo potential changes to the distributions of major and trace nutrients during passage through the straits of southeast island Asia. Coastal currents can resuspend shelf sediments containing nutrients like Si and Fe, while the atmospheric deposition of both natural and anthropogenically derived material from Australia and southeastern Asia can supply N, P, Fe, and other trace metals. Monsoon rains also supply nutrients via wet deposition of aerosols and runoff. These inputs introduce nutrients to the surface ocean of the ITF, where phytoplankton can convert inorganic nutrients to biomass and in turn fuel the entire food chain. In this research aerosols and water column trace metals will be investigated, as a complementary component to another NSF-funded BLOOFINZ project which seeks to understand the N cycling and food-web dynamics of the southern bluefin tuna spawning grounds. The proposed research will address three hypotheses: (H1) The ITF receives inputs of bioactive trace elements from wet and dry atmospheric deposition and resuspended sediments, and (H2) transports these nutrients across the Indian Ocean via the South Equatorial Current (SEC). (H3) Inputs of Fe from atmospheric deposition of mineral and anthropogenic aerosols or continental shelves could help alleviate N limitation in the ITF. To investigate these hypotheses and understand the inputs, removals, and cycles of trace metals in the ITF, the concentrations, elemental ratios, and fluxes of material in aerosols and marine dissolved and particulate phases will be quantified and compared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While significant research has explored malware detection for PCs and mobile devices, these methods are not suitable for IoT systems due to their diverse operating systems and low power. Current models also struggle against sophisticated attacks that aim to evade detection. To address these challenges, the project team is developing DANGER-IoT, an approach to IoT malware detection that works across heterogeneous platforms, is efficient for low-power devices, and robust against advanced attacks. The researchers are collaborating with industry experts to ensure the project's ideas work well in real-world settings and are creating open-source tools and datasets.

In the Ross Sea region, the cold, dry environment has allowed preservation of Adlie penguin bones, feathers, eggshell and even mummified remains, at active and abandoned colonies that date from before the Last Glacial Maximum (more than 45,000 years ago) to the present. A warming period at 4,000-2,000 years ago, known as the penguin ?optimum?, reduced sea ice extent and allowed this species to access and reproduce in the southern Ross Sea. This coastline likely will be reoccupied in the future as marine conditions change with current warming trends. This project will investigate ecological responses in diet and foraging behavior of the Adlie penguin using well-preserved bones and other tissues that date from before, during and after the penguin ?optimum?. The Principal investigators will collect and analyze bones, feathers and eggshells from colonies in the Ross Sea to determine changes in population size and feeding locations over millennia.  Most of these colonies are associated with highly productive areas of open water surrounded by sea ice. Current warming trends are causing relatively rapid ecological responses by this species and some of the largest colonies in the Ross Sea are likely to be abandoned in the next 50 years from rising sea level. The recently established Ross Sea Marine Protected Area aims to protect Adlie penguins and their foraging grounds in this region from human impacts and knowledge on how this species has responded to climate change in the past will support this goal. This project benefits NSF?s mission to expand fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes. In association with their research program, the Principal Investigators will create undergraduate opportunities for research-driven coursework, will design K-12 curriculum and assess the effectiveness of these activities. Two graduate students will be supported by this project to update and refine the curricula working with K-12 teachers. There is also training and partial support included for one doctorate, two master and eight undergraduate students. General public will be reached through social media and YouTube channel productions.<br/><br/>A suite of three stable isotopes (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) will be analyzed in Adelie penguin bones and feathers from active and abandoned colonies to assess ecological shifts through time. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen (?13C and ?15N) are commonly used to investigate animal migration, foraging locations and diet, especially in marine species that can travel over great distances.  Sulfur (?34S) is not as commonly used but is increasingly being applied to refine and corroborate data obtained from carbon and nitrogen analyses. Collagen is one of the best tissues for these analyses as it is abundant in bone, preserves well, and can be easily extracted for analysis.  Using these three isotopes from collagen, ancient and modern penguin colonies will be investigated in the southern, central and northern Ross Sea to determine changes in populations and foraging locations over millennia.  Most of these colonies are associated with one of three polynyas in the Ross Sea. This study will be the first of its kind to apply multiple stable isotope analyses to investigate a living species of seabird over millennia in a region where it still exists today. Results from this project will also inform management on best practices for Adelie penguin conservation affected by climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Success in this project will transform how electrolytes are designed and implemented using a computational approach before costly synthesis and testing. The resulting new knowledge about electrolyte degradation chemistry and new simulation methodologies will benefit the next generation of scientists and engineers working on batteries. This project?s integrated education plan includes developing hands-on research projects with students and faculty at non-research institutions and developing continuing education components for chemical engineers.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to establish electrolyte degradation reactions from first principles as the basis for characterizing, optimizing, and designing novel battery electrolytes. The proposed methods will leverage a novel combination of two recent breakthroughs, making this an ideal time to investigate electrolyte degradation problem from a computational perspective. First, we will use modern semi-empirical quantum chemistry to provide the simulation throughout required to comprehensively describe the complex reaction networks associated with electrolyte degradation. Second, we will apply transfer learning models to improve the accuracy of describing reactions in condensed phases and at electrode interfaces. In combination, these strategies will address the tradeoff between computational accuracy and cost that has limited the application of reaction network characterizations to liquid electrolytes. These simulation methodologies will initially be applied to liquid electrolyte formulations that have widespread usage in contemporary Li-ion and post Li-ion batteries. Despite the fact that these are established electrolytes, the degradation chemistry that drives solid-electrolyte interphase formation and electrolyte-related failure is still incompletely resolved. Thus, by focusing on these electrolyte chemistries, we will be able to validate our characterization methodology while also providing the first complete view of the degradation reactions that occur in these electrolytes. The reaction data generated by these characterizations will also be used to create reaction databases that will facilitate machine learning activities aimed at prioritizing or even circumventing more costly physics-based simulations of electrolytes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the key ideas will likely be to take steps to remove the conventional cell boundaries and facilitate enhanced joint uplink and downlink processing using many dispersed access points (APs). These ideas fall within the academic definition of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO). It alleviates the existing cell-edge and handover problems and improves energy efficiency. The primary limiting factor is achieving cell-free operation in a practically feasible way, with computational complexity and fronthaul requirements that are scalable to large networks with many users. This poses many important research questions that must be explored systematically and in-depth. This project firstly develops scalable artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions. Together with the appropriate (cost-efficient) AP deployment planning tools (e.g., where to put the APs), these developments constitute a significant step toward enabling the low-latency and uniformly reliable wireless services at a lower cost. Given the international nature of the project, the project contributes to the development of a diverse workforce in AI and 6G wireless networks through the formation of international research teams integrating undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>Project research activities are organized into three thrusts. Thrust 1 develops scalable AI-based resource allocation solutions enabling the implementation of large-scale CFmMIMO. The developed solutions are further enhanced by exploring AI architectures applicable to large networks. This includes the security aspects, especially in the context of AI algorithms and architecture, and the cloud radio access network. Thrust 2 focuses on establishing network planning and waveform constraints to address scalable deployment solutions. This includes the development of infrastructure-aware minimum-cost AP deployment methodologies by taking into account the QoS requirements and available transport infrastructure. The developed methodologies are further augmented by developing a network-wide user signal detection method, accounting for the fronthaul capacity and the quantization resolution at each AP. This task also investigates how CFmMIMO can address many of today?s most challenging spectrum policy issues. Evaluation Thrust evaluates and analyzes the methodologies developed in Thrusts 1&2. This employs the existing US and European experimental testbeds and provides a continuous feedback cycle between theory and experimentation. The US team will build upon the prior experience with Colosseum. On the European side, the team will experiment with the Open Air Interface (OAI).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the number of women and students from historically underrepresented groups in computing is low as compared to the general population, recruitment and retention of these students into computing majors will help to fill the growing workforce needs. Over the course of this five-year project, fifteen institutions of higher education in Ohio will join together to form the Ohio Pathways to Undergraduate Computing Success (OPUCS) project. This consortium of nine four-year and six two-year institutions will devise transfer pathways that will increase the number of students who complete their Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science with a focus on supporting women students. This project benefits society by preparing students from diverse backgrounds for high-paying positions, thus meeting the needs of employers and contributing to social mobility for graduates and their families. OPUCS will also provide and study the impact of innovative structural support to women computing students at the academic institutions involved in the consortium.<br/><br/><br/>The OPUCS project objectives are to (1) establish a statewide consortium of nine four-year independent institutions, six two-year community colleges, and 15 industrial partners; (2) develop clearly articulated curricular pathways for students from two-year institutions to computer science bachelor degree completion at a four-year institution; (3) increase the number of students who transfer from two-year to four-year institutions and to complete their bachelor degrees within two years of transfer; (4) increase the number of women transfer students studying computing; (5) increase the number of women who complete internships with our industrial partners; and (6) establish an Association for Computing Machinery?s Council on Women in Computing (ACM-W) chapter at 75% of the consortium institutions. To complete these objectives, the project team will (1) develop an agreed-upon curriculum for the first two years of a computer science program among all OPUCS institutions; (2) use that curriculum as the basis for development of formal articulation agreements; (3) provide specific, detailed, and ongoing training to academic advisors so that students have a planned pathway for degree completion in four years; (4) provide faculty development training to improve the quality of instruction across the consortium; (5) train admission counselors so they are prepared to talk with prospective students about opportunities in computer science; and (6) provide tailored recruitment materials based on proven strategies from the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). Contributions to knowledge will come from investigation into two research questions: (1) To what extent does building a clear academic pathway and offering a familiar social/professional support network among the institutions involved in that pathway lead to an increase in the number of women studying and completing post-secondary computing degrees across Ohio? and (2) Which activities of the OPUCS consortium are perceived as most impactful by women pursuing computing degrees?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low population densities and sparse infrastructure in rural areas, however, make them less attractive for investment in network connectivity. Fifth generation (5G)?s support for vertical industry integration has further magnified the broadband access inequalities between urban and rural environments. Technologies that have been proposed to provide rural broadband access are not designed to address the non-uniformity in demand for communication and computation resources that are found throughout these environments; for example, many automated farming services will have stringent delay requirements for short periods during the day while residential areas exhibit traditional diurnal patterns. This project aims to address this challenge by establishing a core set of methodologies that synergize the design of rural connectivity and computing. Emerging massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is integrated with the design of hierarchical data processing architectures across the rural infrastructure to adapt based on spatial and temporal demand variations. Extensive evaluations are conducted based on a massive MIMO platform and wireless device equipment available from the industrial partner. The project contributes to the development of a diverse workforce in rural broadband and intelligence through the formation of research teams integrating undergraduate and graduate students across institutions.<br/><br/>Project research activities are organized into three thrusts. Thrust 1 develops agile communication techniques under non-uniform rural settings, addressing the needs for multi-user management and resource allocation for massive MIMO infrastructure. This includes the development of novel network control algorithms with scheduling policies that are customized for heterogeneous rural connectivity needs. The developed algorithms are further enhanced by reducing scheduling overhead through position-aided channel representation techniques. Thrust 2 investigates the orchestration of computation tasks under rural non-uniformity, focusing on establishing intelligent rural data processing architectures leveraging the broadband connectivity provided by Thrust 1. Techniques for distributing data processing among clusters of rural devices aiming to execute collaborative tasks rapidly are developed via joint optimization of device-to-device communications and task utility metrics. The orchestration of data processing and intelligence synchronization steps along the rural network hierarchy is also considered to adapt based on task demand variations. Thrust 3 consists of proof-of-concept implementation and testing of the methodologies in Thrust 1&2. This employs a testbed developed leveraging a commercial-grade hybrid massive MIMO base station system engineered by the industrial partner. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by CNS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Few sciences rely on integration more than geosciences, which play critical, foundational roles in nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, from energy exploration and environmental conservation to disaster preparedness. Experiences such as field trips, summer programs, and hands-on outdoor activities have been repeatedly shown to increase retention, maximize learning gains, and improve students? attitudes, perceptions, and feelings toward STEM topics. Unfortunately, field trips can be costly, and physical disabilities and logistical and administrative constraints can restrict access to field-based learning opportunities for many students, potentially hindering their interest in geoscience. This project addresses this important impediment to inclusivity by developing the first immersive, online Virtual Field Trip (VFT) that capitalizes on the exciting imagery and experience of paleontologic fieldwork. The novel VFT will help address issues in exposure to geoscience content by providing high school and early-college teachers with freely available, geoscience-inclusive resources which can be easily incorporated into their existing classes.<br/><br/>This project will capitalize on the broad appeal of both dinosaur paleontology and virtual field trips (VFT) by combining them into an innovative new resource for educators. The VFT will cover core principles of geography, math, biology, and physics within the context of a virtual paleontology expedition, which will function as an open-ended, self-paced, ?capstone? educational program embedded with a plethora of educational ?training? materials and media from real fieldwork. The primary goals of this project are to: (1) increase exposure to geosciences in high schools and early-college classrooms by incorporating lessons utilizing geoscience examples and problems into existing courses; (2) enhance educational content for traditional courses such as geography, math, physics, and biology by integrating these disciplines, and; (3) identify factors contributing to effective recruitment and retention in the geoscience pipeline so that they may be employed by educators to successfully broaden participation in these exciting and impactful fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The number of seeds produced by perennial plants over time shows incredible variation across species and locations, from consistent levels of annual reproduction to boom and bust years of seed production exhibiting extremely high temporal variability, known as ?mast seeding?. Linking relationships among plant reproduction, environmental drivers, and species interactions has primarily focused on aboveground factors such as pollinators and weather conditions; while belowground plant traits, such as root attributes and symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungal networks, have been largely ignored. The purpose of this project is to bring together the aboveground phenomenon of mast seeding, with belowground traits and belowground species interactions using multiple global databases and long-term field data. This study has the potential to reveal new drivers of annual fluctuations in reproduction in natural and managed forestry systems. In addition to exploring the impact of mycorrhizae on reproductive dynamics, this project may inform forestry practices. Many forestry trees are inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi, and this work could allow foresters to develop more efficient tree regeneration techniques. The project will provide a mid-career scientist protected time and interdisciplinary training. Training opportunities for an undergraduate student and a postdoctoral researcher from diverse backgrounds will also be enable by this interdisciplinary study. <br/><br/>This work will use five global databases on mast seeding, and mycorrhizal fungal associations and plant-traits (e.g., TRY, FRED, MycoBD, FungalRoot), with data from a ten-year field study of mast seeding. The investigator has expertise in mast seeding and will work with a collaborative partner with expertise in plant-soil-microbe interactions and structural equation modeling. The project will test hypotheses about how belowground plant traits and mycorrhizal associations influence the range of mast-seeding conditions (e.g., temporal variability, time-lags) observed globally across taxa, over a range of environmental conditions. Multivariate statistical approaches will be applied through structural equation modelling to generate new insight into drivers of the patterns of mast seeding. An undergraduate student will assist with exploring databases, and a postdoctoral researcher will work with the investigator to modernize lab workflows using GitHub and creating Shiny Apps.

Scientists who need high-speed data access often experience frustration in effectively using these heterogeneous storage options. There is need to build the long-missing automated HPC I/O (Input/Output) middleware to transparently help scientists achieve optimal data access performance without their manual efforts. Designing automated HPC I/O middleware for large-scale, heterogeneous, and shared HPC storage systems is an extremely challenging task.

These lasting and predictable fluctuations in temperature and rainfall are known as ""climatic dipoles"" and often emerge across years or decades. A well-known example of this phenomenon is El Nino, where wet conditions across the southern United States are associated with dry conditions to the north. Most ecological studies collect data at local or regional scales. As a result, the continental-scale effects of climatic dipoles on ecological and environmental processes are largely unexplored. Climatic dipoles may provide insight on important phenomena such as animal migrations, agricultural and forest productivity, insect outbreaks, and the emergence of diseases. This study will use long-term observations of bird movements from thousands of citizen scientists, decades of seed production records in trees, and animal population numbers collected throughout the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The project will partner with and guide existing citizen science programs to better predict the effects of climate on animals and plants. The team will organize ""ecoclimatology"" workshops to provide training to early-career scientists interested in both climate science as well as ecology.<br/><br/>The research poses a novel framework of methods applied for space-time pattern discovery, used by climate scientists to analyze variability, to identify climate-ecological dipoles across North America. The overarching hypothesis is that many ecological phenomena are entrained at continental scales by dipole modes of climate variability. Specific questions include: 1) do atmospheric circulations and climatic dipoles synchronize seed production in trees (known as masting) and avian irruptions at continental scales?; 2) do unique modes of climate variability affect the population dynamics for multiple taxa (seed-dependent birds, small mammals, and ticks) at disjunct NEON sites and across multiple time lags?; and 3) how might historic and future environmental change influence these climatic-ecological relationships? Analyzing three decades of data from Project FeederWatch and a recently compiled data set of tree masting at hundreds of sites, the research will explore the use of empirical orthogonal functions to understand climate variability impacting plant and animal communities during a time of rapid environmental change. Ecological observatory networks, such as NEON, and citizen science databases are increasingly rich in information. Employing these analytical approaches from climate science will represent a key advance for ecological research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, AI has been emerging as a prominent tool for biological data analyses including assisting with medical diagnostics as well as the detection of disease-related mutations in genetics and genomics. We aim to employ AI to improve and refine gene functional annotations as well as predict functions for previously unclassified genes in Arabidopsis, a model plant system. Given that biological systems including plant-pathogen interactions are exceedingly complex and genes to phenotype relationships require an understanding of diverse layers of biological information, we will utilize a deep learning- and network-based framework that can integrate multiple heterogeneous datasets to obtain more accurate inferences of gene functions. We will validate our computational findings using experimental approaches. Specifically, we will focus on a set of genes that are related to ?Sulfur?, which is considered ?the 4th major phytonutrient? using genetics and plant pathology approaches. We expect a variety of deliverables to a wide range of users including researchers both nationally and internationally, educators in high schools, systems biology and bioinformatics specialists, and the plant research community in general. This will provide biological insights, gene prioritization, and testable hypotheses to plant researchers. Moreover, we will discern the molecular mechanisms of newly identified genes in plant defense.

Specifically, we will generate a suite of diverse co-expression networks using transcriptome studies derived from a wide spectrum of biotic and abiotic stress treatments including plant-pathogen interactions. These co-expression networks will be integrated to transcription factor-targets and protein-protein interaction networks.

Automated driving technologies are expected to improve traffic safety, promote travel efficiency, protect the environment, reduce mobility barriers for older generations or people with disabilities, and thus deliver overall societal benefits. However, existing algorithms embedded in autonomous vehicles still face fundamental challenges in recognizing the quickly changing intentions of pedestrians moving on the road and sidewalks, making it hard to predict their behavior and plan vehicle motions. Such limitations impede the implementation of fully autonomous and safe cars in city environments and create additional risks for pedestrians and other road users. This project focuses on developing novel techniques to model and predict the complex and changing intentions of pedestrians. By learning the thinking process of drivers and their driving responses, an algorithm will be created to equip the automated cars with similar capabilities to interact with pedestrians and other road users smoothly and safely. The research process will include naturalistic driving data collection, subject experiments, knowledge modeling, and learning algorithm development. The developed algorithm will be evaluated in an immersive virtual environment. The project also includes activities to promote user-centered design in engineering education, foster the awareness of biases and ethical issues related to artificial intelligence technologies, and increase the participation of underrepresented communities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. <br/><br/>This project surmounts limitations of current pedestrian behavior prediction to achieving mutual intelligibility between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Principally, unlike the traditional static view of pedestrian intention at a critical moment, this research investigates the relationship between non-verbal actions and intention changes of pedestrians moment-to-moment in dynamic (changing) and interactive situations. The project collects temporal video segments and human reasoning descriptions simultaneously through event-segmentation-based video experiments. Then, it develops a compositional learning method to learn and combine language features with visual features. This method can avoid the rigid structure of expert-selected feature space by creating collective features from ordinary drivers, and the three-level explainability of the learning model can justify model outputs from input features. Finally, the developed intention prediction model will be evaluated through subject experiments in a virtual interactive pedestrian simulator. The research findings will be shared through industrial collaborators and conferences, and a pedestrian behavior benchmark dataset will be disseminated to the public. The research results will be included in engineering education to promote design approaches that take into account the users? feelings, values, and overall mental state (empathic design).  These educational activities will include courses at the investigator?s university, the autonomous driving research community, and industry.  They will increase the awareness of critical human-centered AI issues like biases, trust, and social intelligence in design of AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immersion is especially important for pilots, who rely on simulation to train for routine operations, but also for emergencies. While dedicated, high-fidelity, and approved flight simulators are already used as part of flight training, their cost and space requirements prohibit their wider use. VR headsets connected to a computer simulator setup can enhance training both at home and within a flight training program. Despite the popularity of air travel and the need for pilots in the aviation industry, becoming a pilot is a dream that most abandon after childhood, either in pursuit of other passions or because of its prohibitive initial investment in cost and time, resulting in a nationwide pilot shortage. This project will study skill transfer from VR-based simulation to the real world by evaluating the physical, functional, and cognitive characteristics of simulation which impact a trainee?s ability to learn efficiently and effectively, as applied to the flight training environment. This project will make flight more accessible as a career and field of study through the use of virtual reality flight simulators. Additionally, it will broaden participation in aviation-careers and interests through outreach activities at local airports and by providing future pilots with online modules to help them initiate their training. Flight simulation performance-based and emergency response competitions will allow those already in training to test their skills and educate them on using flight simulation for their own practice. This award will enhance flight training, resulting in reduced flight training accidents and decreased time to certification, thus improving our ability to respond to the pilot shortage.<br/><br/>This project will study skill transfer from virtual reality to the physical world by evaluating the physical, functional, and cognitive fidelity characteristics of simulation that impact a trainee pilot?s ability to learn efficiently and effectively. Two experiments will measure skill transfer. The first will train novice pilots completely in virtual reality and evaluate their abilities in the aircraft. The second will follow a group of pilots who are pursuing an instrument certificate throughout their training and complement their training with simulation scenarios on both traditional simulators and a virtual reality flight simulator. Complementing flight training with simulation will investigate the impact of virtual reality interventions on skill acquisition and mental workload management. The data collected through both experiments will be used to evaluate and validate the use of virtual reality in both research and training as an alternative to physical simulators. This work will collect flight data through on-board flight data recorders and simulation software, physiological data through eye tracking and heart rate monitoring, and psychometric data through mobile surveys. Scoring algorithms will detect and evaluate human performance on a series of maneuvers. This project will advance our understanding of how humans learn in complex virtual reality environments such as flight training, validating virtual reality systems as a training device option, and therefore reducing the cost and time of highly advanced training in fields, which require the use of multiple skills simultaneously. The research will identify which types of skills transfer, use data-driven metrics to measure skill acquisition and transfer, validate the use of eye tracking and hear rate metrics in virtual reality, and develop a framework to assess modern simulators based on how they address learning outcomes, informing policy and regulation. The integration of education and research in this proposal is focused on a three-level approach: (i) creating interest through outreach activities; (ii) empowering actions through online training modules and the use of VR-based flight simulation; (iii) advancing training through self-practice and semi-annual competitive flight simulation events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second thrust creates computer vision and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to generate neuronal tracing, and software to aid efficient human proofreading and error correction. This will allow the generation of gold-standard neuronal tracing and segmentation from relatively sparse Brainbow labeling as training inputs. The third thrust creates a generative machine learning model to create realistic Bitbow neurons and synthesize images with various labeling densities based on the sparse annotation training inputs. The fourth thrust develops an annotation machine learning model to reconstruct the densely labeled trans-Tango/Bitbow Drosophila brains with the machine-learning-generated Bitbow images and their corresponding ground truth annotations as training inputs.

These changes have led to growing concerns over power system dynamics and stability, due to the reduced capability of grid inertia and increasing levels of external disturbances and variability. Meanwhile, the electricity infrastructure has benefited significantly from the ongoing deployment of sensing and cyber resources, which give rise to a huge amount of high-rate, high-quality data and information collected during real-time operations. Thanks to the enriched data availability, machine learning advances are envisioned to play an increasingly important role to address the challenges in power system dynamics and stability. This project aims to bridge domain-specific machine learning tools to transform the current grid dynamic modeling, inference, and stability-enforcing solutions. At a societal level, the anticipated outcomes can improve energy efficiency and security, and facilitate higher and smoother penetration of renewables and carbon-free resources. This project will further benefit industry practices with advanced algorithmic solutions, as well as education efforts by providing student training opportunities and reaching out to pre-college students via interactive demos. <br/><br/>This project will develop data-enabled and physics-informed modeling, monitoring, and optimization algorithmic solutions targeting power system dynamics. The proposed activities put forth and explore three creative, original, and potentially transformative ideas: i) Correlating synchrophasor data collected at two arbitrary grid locations can efficiently unveil the impulse response of the associated linear time-invariant (LTI) system under certain assumptions, which can be waived leveraging physics-informed analysis; ii) Gaussian processes (GPs) constitute a powerful tool for inferring signals occurring in LTI systems, and thanks to the underlying physics, GPs can be uniquely adapted to learn grid dynamic signals and their derivatives from heterogeneous, noisy, spatially and temporally incomplete, and/or multirate synchrophasor readings; iii) Well-established grid stability metrics can be expressed as convex functions of the steady-state operating point, and stability-aware OPFs can be handled via a semidefinite program relaxation. The outcome will be a comprehensive suite of computational tools dealing with grid dynamics from learning to power system operations, evaluated by both real-event synchrophasor datasets, and synthetic datasets generated from realistic power systems such as a Texas 2000-bus case in collaboration with ERCOT.

Computational thinking is a means to understand and solve complex problems using computer science concepts. Despite its increasing importance, as reflected in national standards and initiatives, no single preservice teacher prepared to teach computational thinking has graduated from the teacher education programs in West Virginia, and the situation nationally is similarly challenging. Most often, a sole focus on computer science provides no explicit connection to disciplinary classroom settings and student context, missing important opportunities for preservice teachers to recognize what computational thinking may mean in their future classrooms. Without systemic changes in teacher education, preservice teachers are likely to develop insufficient levels of understanding of and interest in the computational nature of science. Consequently, preservice teacheers will be limited in providing their students with important knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the workforce of the future. To address the issue, this project aims to develop and implement a computational thinking-infused curriculum in science methods courses. The project intends to co-design and pilot science lessons in schools where elementary preservice teachers are placed. The research agenda of the project is designed to investigate the impact of the efforts on the teaching of preservice teachers.  By the end of the project, the participating preservice teachers are expected to know, practice, and teach critical computation thinking-infused science lessons. Project activities are anticipated to result in a model and a set of resources that can be tested and used in teacher education nationwide to cultivate preservice teachers? computational thinking-enhanced STEM learning and teaching.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to help preservice teachers develop interest, competence, and a positive perception of the utility value for incorporating critical computational thinking into their science instructional practices. Project research questions focus on measuring these constructs and identifying computational thinking practices and processes exemplified in preservice teachers? teaching efforts over time. Approximately 100 preservice teachers, enrolled in science methods courses in the Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education Program of West Virginia University are intended to participate over two years. Preservice teachers are intended to have the opportunity to practice, design, and teach contextualized science lesson units that integrate both computational thinking processes and practices with the 5E Instructional Model, a widely accepted constructivist, inquiry-based instructional model for teaching science. Project research aims to determine the impact of computational thinking-infused activities on preservice teachers? motivations and teaching. Then the project intends to employ a research-practitioner partnership perspective during full-time preservice teacher placement experiences. Selected preservice teachers are to be involved in iteratively co-designing, with multiple stakeholders from the local education community, piloting, and testing computational thinking-infused science lesson units in placement classrooms. Through the dissemination of project activities, research outcomes regarding how to integrate a critical computational thinking lens with the 5E Model, and developed materials, this project intends not only to help develop preservice teachers? understanding of and interest in the computational nature of science teaching but also likely enable teacher educators and in-service teachers nationwide to recognize its relevance to pedagogy, content, and context, contributing to students? preparation toward future STEM workforce. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

This process, performed in part by a structure in the brains of mammals called hippocampus, facilitates memory discrimination and is affected in brain disorders like dementia and post-traumatic stress disorders. As a result, animals and people suffering from these disorders experience difficulties recalling or accurately retrieving memories. Our understanding of how the hippocampus encodes similar experiences as distinct memories, allowing for easy discrimination during recall, is still limited. Recent advancements in neuroscience suggest that coordinated activity between excitatory and inhibitory neurons enables a specific computation known as pattern separation within the hippocampal circuit. This computation transforms similar input patterns into highly dissimilar output patterns and is thought to be the basis for memory discrimination. In the proposed research, the investigators aim to determine the contribution of a specific type of inhibitory neurons called cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK) neurons to the hippocampal circuit?s function. Their long-term goal is to enhance our understanding of critical computations, like pattern separation, performed by this brain region, which are crucial for memory discrimination.  As part of this project, the investigators also provide a strong educational and training environment to students and new generations of scientists with a strong emphasis in recruiting and training minorities and under-represented groups in STEM, and they participate in outreach programs, such as the Big Brother Big Sister event organized by the Reno Museum of Natural History, which they use as a platform to share their research with the general public and students of all ages.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to determine the contribution of CCK neurons to hippocampal circuit function, focusing on the plasticity of CCK neurons during the developmental period of juvenile mice. Their previous work demonstrates that environmental enrichment (EE) leads to increased synapses formed by CCK neurons in the dentate gyrus, suggesting their involvement in the maturation of hippocampal function and pattern separation. For the proposed work, they use an EE paradigm in mice and take advantage of viral mediated gene delivery technique combined with optogenetic approaches to manipulate the activity of the CCK neurons. They determine how the remodeling of the inhibitory CCK network adjusts the computation in the DG. In the first Objective of the project, they determine the contribution of CCK neurons to feedback and feedforward inhibitory microcircuits, both of which can impact pattern separation. In the second Objective, they measure the change in pattern separation and filtering performance of the DG induced by the EE using a novel in-vitro electrophysiological protocol. Together their research aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying pattern separation by exploring the involvement of CCK neurons in the hippocampal circuit. By increasing our understanding of these fundamental computations, they will shed light on the processes that support efficient memory functioning and potentially contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for memory-related disorders.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Modulation Program of the Neural Systems Cluster in the BIO Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, imagine while eating brunch at a busy intersection you witness a horrific car accident. While you may have great memory for the anguish in the passenger?s face, you may not have great memory for how the car accident transpired (e.g., was the driver texting while driving?). Understanding how emotion distorts memories is of critical importance because as a society we use personal accounts of prior events to inform communication in both legal and media contexts. This project increases our understanding of how individuals form memories for complex emotional events by defining the features of learning that contribute to distortions in memory. The project leverages rodent and animal models of how emotional arousal influences brain structures underlying memory and extends them by employing more real-life, threatening events. There is accumulating evidence that emotional events heighten threat-related arousal, such as increases in sweating and heart rate, which can impair the function of regions known to construct episodic memories, such as the hippocampus. However, most laboratory based studies use static word lists or pictures as experimental stimuli, which preclude the ability to understand how threat changes individuals? ability to construct accurate memory-based narratives of real-world situations. Threat may bias memory formation towards the most emotional parts of events while also encouraging the ignoring of mundane details (like where or when the event happened) which makes it difficult to accurately reflect on how events unfolded. A series of behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments, using highly arousing naturalistic stimuli, address arousal?s role in fragmented memory by placing individuals in more complex, threatening environments than previous research. Understanding the intersection of emotion, arousal, and memory cohesion has broad implications for improving methods to make sure when individuals convey their interpretations of past events to broader audiences?such as an individual sharing their interpretation of a traumatic event to a news outlet or a courtroom?we can accurately determine which parts of their memories are more or less fallible. Alongside the research project are plans for the mentorship of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate trainees, public outreach through theatre events and digital media, and a plan to develop collaborations with experts in eye-witness testimony, digital media, and memory research. <br/><br/>This project translates models of arousal-mediated biases in episodic memory into the domain of naturalistic, ecologically-relevant stimuli in humans. Research in both rodents and humans shows that emotional memory is supported by a cascade of events which are triggered by threat detection in the amygdala, which then increases physiological arousal and noradrenergic tone in concert with facilitating medial temporal lobe-dependent encoding. These neuromodulatory signals are specifically thought to bias memory encoding towards cortical medial temporal lobe-based memory representations over hippocampal-dependent representations, which in turn results in greater memory for the most salient features of an emotional event at the expense of more mundane details. Critically, intact hippocampal function is necessary to form cohesive memories that maintain their temporal order, contextual details, and a continuous narrative. It follows that, due to amygdala involvement, memories of emotionally arousing events would lack typical markers of hippocampal-dependent memory such as a cohesive temporal narrative. However, prior research has precluded testing such hypotheses based on the use of more simplistic stimuli that are static and lack narrative structures (i.e., word lists, pictures). Emerging work in the cognitive neuroscience of memory has provided behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging techniques to assay memory processes that unfold over time by utilizing more complex memoranda that include a narrative structure. In the first set of studies, participants attend a highly arousing haunted house during the collection of physiological data and then complete free recall tests characterizing the cohesive structure of their memories. In a second series of studies, the investigators leverage neuroimaging methods during the encoding and free recall of horror and neutral movies clips to better understand the relationship between amygdala-medial temporal lobe interactions, physiological arousal, and memory distortion. In the final series of studies, the investigators manipulate individuals? agency while playing a horror-themed video game, testing a novel hypothesis that agency may protect individuals from arousal-based memory distortions by providing them control over the event, a form of intrinsic emotion regulation. Thus, these studies expand our knowledge on emotional memory by moving beyond simple laboratory-based stimuli into more naturalistic memoranda (i.e., staged events, movie viewing, videogame play). Together, this project tests a model by which physiological arousal disrupts hippocampal-dependent encoding resulting in fragmented, distorted representations of past events which are less communicable to the public. Understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms that drive memory distortions for complex, aversive events provides a foundation of knowledge to more accurately assess the veracity of individuals? memories for traumatic events, and provides targets of remediation to reduce distortions in memory. Thus, the findings from this project inform practices of incorporating first-person narratives in service of societal well-being in legal and media contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In additional to PhD mentoring and high-school outreach, the education plan includes research opportunities for undergraduates and the development of a new course in sublinear graph algorithms at Rutgers University.<br/><br/>This project centers on three major challenges to processing massive graphs. The first is that such graphs are too large to fit in the memory of a computer, so the data must be compressed on the fly. The second is that it would take too long for a single computer to process the graph, so the computation is distributed over many machines. The third that is that in many applications the underlying graph is changing over time and it is necessary to respond to these changes locally. The project develops novel tools for tackling each individual challenge. At the same time, the project introduces general frameworks that connect the studies of these different challenges and lead to tools that can overcome a broad set of obstacles simultaneously. More specifically, what unifies the above challenges is the need to extrapolate global information about the entire graph from local information computed in small regions. For example, can one detect overloaded vertices from a small random sample of the graph? How can shortest paths in different regions be patched together to form a path from one end of the graph to another? How can a graph be compressed to only retain the most relevant edges? By answering these and related questions, the research will help extend the motivating applications to significantly larger scales and will lead to new mathematical insights into the structure of graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them. The project team will also train hundreds of early career scientists, whose research and teaching will benefit from the easy manipulation and use of digital biological specimens. Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources.

However, safe and effective use of these devices is limited by the rigid, non-biocompatible electronic components that must be incorporated to allow execution of the required functions. This project seeks to study how soft and fully biocompatible materials can be leveraged to interact directly with signals from the body without damaging tissue. A transistor fabricated from these materials will be used to create the circuits necessary for bioelectronic devices to acquire and modulate the activity of neurons in the brain. The outcome of the research will benefit society by improving the design of bioelectronic devices currently used for patients with conditions such as epilepsy or Parkinson's disease by eliminating the need for implantation of bulky or rigid materials in the body. This project will also facilitate understanding of the principles underlying interactions between the body and electronic devices. The educational component of this project leverages ion-gated transistors as biocompatible and low-cost components to be used in student and educator projects that teach principles of bioelectronic device design. These projects will be maintained in a comprehensive database to facilitate dissemination to educators and outreach coordinators, providing evidence-based methods to improve project-based learning in bioelectronics more broadly. The educational objectives of the project are to provide students and educators with hands-on opportunities to design and test simple, biocompatible bioelectronic devices. These efforts will increase exposure to engineering methods in schools and stimulate interest in bioelectronics to benefit health.<br/><br/>There is an enormous need to develop bioelectronic components that can merge biocompatibility, ion transduction, high speed, and reliable operation in physiological environments. The objective of the project is to develop ion-driven, conformable, implantable bioelectronic devices to enable efficient interaction with neural circuits. The central hypothesis is that ion-gated transistors will effectively interact with neural signals because they can directly transduce the brain's ionic flux, and are sufficient to create the integrated circuits required for fully implantable, soft, closed-loop devices that do not require rigid encapsulation. The research involves fabrication of integrated circuits comprised of ion-gated transistors with comprehensive in vitro and modeling-based characterization of the parameters governing their operation in physiologic environments. These devices are then used to modulate neural networks in an in vivo animal model of epilepsy and acquire neurophysiologic data from human subjects. The rationale underlying this research is that realization of such devices will transform design of bioelectronic devices with the potential to enhance diagnosis and therapy for neuropsychiatric disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fungi and bacteria are microorganisms that often live in a close association and play a key role in transforming and detoxifying metals in the environment. In spite of this importance, there is relatively little understanding of how the interactions between bacteria and fungi influence the transformation and/or detoxification of metals. The goal of this project is to address this knowledge gap by identifying how fungal-bacterial interactions affect metal transformation. This will be achieved through a novel multidisciplinary research approach employing advanced, state-of-the-science analytical techniques. Knowledge gained through this project will allow the engineered control of metal transformations for a wide range of applications in environmental cleanup, biorefining, production of nanoparticles, and other beneficial applications. Successful completion of this research has strong potential to benefit society through improvements in environmental remediation and industrial manufacturing. This project will improve the Nation?s STEM workforce by providing a unique training opportunity for student researchers that bridges diverse fields such as environmental engineering, microbiology, geochemistry, bioinformatics, and art.<br/><br/>Remediation of metal contamination is a major environmental challenge because, unlike many organic pollutants, metal species cannot be degraded and can only be extracted or biotransformed to less toxic forms. While past approaches to biotransform metals have focused primarily on single microorganisms, host-microbiome interactions have shown potential to biotransform surrounding environments and improve host resiliency. However, the mechanisms for metal biotransformation by microbial host-microbiome systems are largely unknown. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the rules of life that govern fungal microbiomes. This goal will be achieved through a specific focus on fungal microbiomes, which include a fungal host, endosymbionts (endobacteria), and symbionts (exobacteria that live extracellularly) as a model host-microbiome system. The specific research objectives of this project designed to achieve the goal are to: understand the effects of metals and metalloids on the diversity and transmission of fungal microbiomes (facultative and obligatory); and determine the role of fungal microbiomes in metal tolerance by mediating the uptake, transformation, and sorption of metal ions, nanoparticles, or other metal species. A deeply integrated multidisciplinary approach will be used to investigate physiological, genetic/genomic, and metabolic processes that govern the structure and function of fungal microbiomes in the presence of metals. This will be achieved using novel state-of-the-science isotope probing, advanced microscopy, spectroscopy, and integrated genomics, transcriptomics, and metallomics to elucidate how the microbiome influences the metabolic activity of the host towards metal ions. Successful completion of this research has strong potential to identify new genes and/or pathways for metal tolerance and biotransformation, as well as expand our mechanistic understanding of the structure and function of fungal microbiomes in nature. This knowledge has strong potential to benefit society by facilitating applications in remediation, water treatment, electronics manufacturing, antimicrobial production, medicine, and related fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity since they are among the most natural ways to represent the fundamental objects in the EDA flow. However, with increased design complexity and chip capacity, an increasing performance gap exists between the extremely large graphs in EDA and the insufficient support from general-purpose hardware, such as mainstream graphics processing units (GPUs). This project aims to expedite the large graph machine learning on various EDA tasks, through a full-fledged development of efficient and scalable computing paradigms. This project's novelties are EDA domain knowledge-aware graph machine learning, training acceleration, and algorithm-hardware co-design and optimization. The project's broader significance and importance include: (1) to advance the field of machine learning in chip design, highlighted in National Artificial Intelligence Initiative; (2) to deepen the understanding of interactions among EDA domain knowledge, graph learning, and GPU acceleration; (3) to enrich the computer engineering curriculum and promote participation from undergraduates, underrepresented groups, and K-12 students in STEM fields through relevant programs.<br/><br/>The project will develop a design paradigm for efficient, scalable and practical algorithm-hardware co-optimized solutions to significantly accelerate large graph machine learning on EDA tasks using a single GPU.

As such, public safety organizations and first responders are increasingly reliant on Information Communication Technology (ICT) to perform their duties. Disaster management requires a set of capabilities, which includes resource management, access to relevant data and information, and robust and resilient communications. In support of these needs, the RESCUE project will design a three dimensional (3D) networks architecture that exploits the advances in the field of next generation wireless networks to provide a prototype solution such that an integrated communications system for disaster relief operations is realized. Additionally, an innovative massive multiple access mechanism and a dynamic spectrum sharing model will be introduced to increase the public safety system?s capacity and improve the spectrum utilization, respectively, during the relief operations. A new Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution will be proposed to support scenarios of Global Positioning System (GPS) denial by utilizing the next generation networks technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The outcomes will have long-lasting benefits for the communications, and in turn the well-being, of the victims and first responders during disaster relief operations.  Furthermore, the project will provide unique training for graduate and undergraduate students at the crossroads of reinforcement learning and next generation networking technologies.<br/><br/>The RESCUE project will introduce a novel 3D networks architecture that exploits terrestrial and aerial base stations to provide the necessary redundancy of communications during disaster relief operations. A novel massive multiple access mechanism will support the victims and first responders? connectivity, and a robust dynamic spectrum sharing model will improve the spectrum utilization during disaster scenarios characterized by increased traffic demand. Innovative mechanisms to support the extended communications coverage, the mobility management, and the efficient resource management of the limited communications resources will be designed via utilization of the next generation wireless networks? technologies of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces, Intelligent Omni-Surfaces, and the Integrated Access and Backhaul.  A new positioning, navigation, and timing solution will support the disaster relief operations in cases of GPS-denial scenarios or indoor environments by exploiting the next generation wireless networks? technologies.

Failures of such goal-directed decision-making can result in an array of maladaptive behaviors, such as financial risk taking, drug abuse, or gambling. While past research has helped identify the drivers of goal-directed decisions, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how people are able to reorient those decisions as flexibly as they do, as well as when and why they fail to do so. In a series of studies that combine computational modeling with measures of behavior, attentional focus, and brain activity, we are studying the capacities and limits of human decision-makers to flexibly adjust their information search and actions to different goals and task demands. By uncovering the hidden levers and potential failure modes of goal-directed behavior, our work better disentangles sources of real-world decision-making failures, and provide a path towards targeted interventions to better align choices with long-term goals. <br/><br/>Our project addresses critical gaps in research on the neural and computational mechanisms that link decision-making and cognitive control. Past work on the computational and neural mechanisms of goal-directed decision-making has been singularly focused on a narrow subset of human goals (how people select the best option from a set). It is therefore unknown how people flexibly reconfigure to their wider array of goals ? for instance, selecting under different criteria or accumulating information across options rather than comparing between them ? and when and why they fail to do so. Our project develops and tests a computational framework that accommodates the range of flexibility observed in human decision-making, by representing explicit choice goals that define a) how information is translated into evidence and b) how evidence is then integrated to select responses. We are testing our framework in a series of studies that combine behavioral tasks with eye-tracking, EEG and fMRI. This multi-modal approach allows us to uncover the neural circuits and dynamics that enable people to flexibly transform and integrate information about their options to achieve their current goals, and to understand how and why people vary in these capacities.

Stochastic parameterization is a modeling scheme where the variables representing the sub grid physics (i.e., diffusion coefficients representing wave-particle interactions) are selected randomly from a distribution instead of using a deterministic average. This allows for explicit variance of the sub-grid physics and better error quantification through ensemble modeling.

Remarkably, a common strategy that has evolved to help organisms across all kingdoms of life deal with desiccation is through the synthesis of a special class of proteins known as intrinsically disordered proteins. Despite their importance in protecting animals and plants from drying out, how these proteins work is unresolved. This project will combine experiments that span individual molecules to whole organisms to understand how disordered proteins provide protection from dehydration across all kingdoms of life. As part of this study, this project will recruit students from rural communities via remote-learning and include them in cutting edge, interdisciplinary research which will facilitate their integration into the US STEM workforce. <br/><br/>Proteomes across all kingdoms of life contain a significant fraction of sequences that are intrinsically disordered and do not adopt a stable three-dimensional structure. Instead, these sequences exist in an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations that can be highly sensitive to changes in the cellular environment in which they function. Interestingly, many of these disordered proteins are implicated in mediating resistance to environmental stresses, including desiccation, in which the physical-chemical composition of the cell changes dramatically. The goal of this project is to gain a holistic understanding of how disordered proteins and the cellular environment come together to provide protection to the cell during extreme desiccation. Towards this goal, the project will employ a multilevel, interdisciplinary, and integrated approach. Starting at the molecular level, in vitro and computational experiments will be performed that will provide insight into how desiccation-protective disordered proteins function in conjunction with well defined and controllable environments. This information will be integrated with high throughput, sequencing-based studies of disordered protein-mediated desiccation protection performed in yeast (cellular level), and a multicellular animal model (the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, organismal level).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
