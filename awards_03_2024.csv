This process, known as regression testing, is widely used in software development practice. A major problem in the generation of test cases is the presence of flaky tests:  tests that non-deterministically pass or fail on the same version of the code. Failures from flaky tests can mislead developers about their recent changes, waste developers? time, and reduce developers? trust in software testing. Many software development organizations have reported that flaky tests are one of their biggest problems, because they confound assurance goals.   This project aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of regression testing in the presence of flaky tests. It will produce tools that aim to be efficient and effective at resolving the inherent nondeterminism.  The work focuses on (1) reducing the cost of flaky-test detection and debugging techniques by predicting important test properties, (2) developing new techniques to predict flakiness-related properties, (3) speeding up and reducing the resources needed by regression testing, (4) developing new techniques to systematically detect flaky tests, and (5) reducing the flakiness in Android user interface testing. The project will also produce curriculum for education and training on the topic of programming in the face of nondeterminism, and will work with industry to transfer technology. <br/><br/>The research on flakiness will move from the typical, black-box approaches to a new level for detecting, debugging, and fixing through novel, white-box and learning-based approaches. The approach will use static and dynamic analyses to compute state pollution, which may affect test flakiness based on the test execution order. The work involves combinatorial design theory to improve the efficiency of order-dependent test detection. Special attention will be paid to flaky tests in graphical user interfaces using record-and-replay and test input generation.  Test  coverage computations, which can be used to predict whether a code change will affect the test's output, will use a machine learning approach.   The work will result in tool implementations and large-scale evaluations in open source and proprietary environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The direction in which a cell divides with respect to the tissue around it determines the position of the two daughter cells. This direction can therefore contribute to tissue shape; for example, oriented cell divisions are implicated in building the tubes that help comprise the lung and kidneys. Placement can also contribute to cell type diversity; oriented cell divisions help to explain how the brain is populated with a range of different cell types. This project takes advantage of recent technical advances in both microscopy and CRISPR-mediated genome editing to examine division orientation across multiple cell and tissue types in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. This work will resolve the molecular mechanisms that orient cell divisions with respect to the tissue.  The Broader Impact include the intrinsic nature of the research as all multi-cellular organisms utilize asymmetric divisions to sort cells in tissues.  Additional activities include promoting diversity in science, the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, along with post-doctoral researchers.<br/><br/>Cell division is controlled not only in time, but also in space. Regulated division orientation can drive asymmetry, as is often the case with stem or progenitor cells that produce daughters with different cell fates, and is also implicated in determining tissue shape and size. Previous work shows that division orientation is determined at metaphase, and is controlled by an evolutionarily conserved set of proteins. These proteins, which include the microtubule motor dynein, combine to produce a pulling force that acts on the mitotic spindle, drawing it into a particular alignment. In order to function correctly, the pulling force must be restricted to a particular region of the cell periphery. However, the precise location must vary according to the cell type. The mechanisms that control localization of the pulling force are unclear, and appear to be diverse. The investigator proposes firstly to study how the pulling force is localized across cell types. He proposes secondly to study a critical spindle orientation factor called Mud (in flies), NuMA (in vertebrates) and LIN-5 (in nematodes), and to determine the function of endogenous variants that are not predicted to promote localized pulling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The continuing technology scaling over the past decades has provided plentiful miniaturized devices with unprecedented performance and efficiency at the disposal of the designer. However, implementing ICs using modern technologies is not an easy task.    The ever-increasing performance and robustness requirements and technology sophistications have rendered design, verification, and manufacturing complex and costly. This has tremendous impact on two fronts: design productivity and quality assurance, which are the targets of this project.   First, there is a pressing need to close the widening design productivity gap due to the increasing circuit and system complexities, and shortage of experienced human designers, specifically for knowledge-intensive custom circuit design. Second, it is desirable to provide quality assurance in lieu of a combination of growing process instabilities and variations and demanding robustness requirements for mission critical applications such as automotive electronics, avionics, and biomedicine.  This project will develop innovative machine learning technology to close the productivity gap and address the challenge in quality design in today?s ever-complex IC design and manufacturing setting. The algorithms, circuit models, and design tools resulted from this work will be disseminated in broad communities through publications, workshops, talks, and research collaborations. The lead investigator will actively recruit undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, for research participation and training while partnering with various outreach programs.  The project will produce excellent materials to be integrated into undergraduate and graduate level curriculum on integrated circuits and computer aided design powered by modern machine learning technology, thereby providing excellent workforce training opportunities in these areas of importance.  Engagement with the US high-tech industry and other research organizations will be sought to broaden the impact of this work, and promote potential technology transfer to the practice.<br/><br/>The technical approach of this work centers on semi-supervised learning, which allows for simultaneous use of labeled and unlabeled data for the targeted machine learning applications. While showing promise, semi-surprised learning has yet to be systemically explored in the integrated circuits community. To this end, this work will develop a semi-supervised learning framework to address the key challenge brought by lack of expensive labeled data and domain-specific needs of IC design and quality assurance, broadly applicable to data-efficient circuit optimization, failure and anomaly detection, test, and manufacturing data analysis. The focused domain-specific semi-supervised learning is promising in offering a potentially game-changing solution to the intended circuit applications by leveraging large amounts of cheap unlabeled data and reducing the utilization of expensive labeled data to its minimum.  Specifically, this work will provide solutions to data-efficient design optimization and quality assurance under two settings: static and adaptive semi-supervised learning. In the former setting, learning is performed over a provided labeled dataset without additional labeled data query. The latter setting opens up the added dimension of adaptive semi-supervised learning with improved quality of learning and further reduced labeled data use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to help transit decision-makers understand the impacts of deep learning models on their decision-making outcomes such as transit timetable design and bus motion control. It also aims to offer transit researchers and practitioners a novel framework for developing deep learning models with verifiable decision quality in both normal and adversarial (e.g., malicious cyberattacks, sensor malfunctions, and extreme weather conditions) scenarios. The outcomes of this project will open new research areas in both fundamental methodologies and civil infrastructure applications. The project will offer interdisciplinary education and research training opportunities and new deep-learning-related courses to undergraduate and graduate students. It will also involve under-represented minority students at the secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels through course projects, research assistantships and internship opportunities.<br/><br/>This research project integrates deep learning theories with knowledge and methods from transportation engineering to generate new knowledge on the interplay between learning-based prediction and transit decision-making. Theoretical bounds identified through this research projct will assist transit agencies in designing deep learning models, such as choosing the right sample size and identifying the appropriate model architecture, to optimize transit decision-making quality. A new deep learning paradigm will be created to overcome the limitations of existing works, thereby assuring optimal decision-making outcomes in transit systems. This researched paradigm intends to leverage decision errors to update parameters in deep learning models so that they move toward optimal and reliable decisions directly. This paradigm could not only benefit transportation systems but also transform many other infrastructure systems such as power distribution and communications where parameter prediction and decision-making are currently largely siloed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Widely adopted for resilience purposes by long-running applications (i.e., checkpoint-restart), it has seen an explosion of additional use cases that directly help applications progress faster and reduce time-to-solution even in the absence of failures: adjoint computations (essential in financial modeling, weather prediction, computational fluid dynamics, seismic imaging, and control theory) need to capture a history of checkpoints in a forward pass, which are then revisited in a backward pass. Training artificial intelligence models, increasingly used by scientific applications, often results in trajectories that do not lead to convergence or may lead to undesirable patterns, prompting the need to backtrack to an earlier checkpoint of the learning model to try an alternative. Transfer learning and fine-tuning using a previous checkpoint of a learning model can be used to adapt the training more quickly, avoiding expensive training from scratch. Many other use cases are important in scientific computing: suspend-resume (e.g., to preempt a long-running job in favor of a higher priority job), migration (checkpoint on one machine, restart on another), debugging (replay a problematic code region to reproduce errors without starting from scratch), and reproducibility (checkpoint and compare intermediate data during repeated runs). Despite broad applicability, current state-of-the-art solutions lack the flexibility, performance, and scalability needed to address these scenarios efficiently. The Versioned Lineage-Driven Checkpointing of Composable States (VLCC-States) project aims to fill this gap. It will streamline the development and use of checkpointing patterns for scientific applications, which simplifies and improves the reusability of integration efforts across different communities, improves awareness of the multitude of checkpointing scenarios, reduces development effort and cost, and enables flexible customization to extract the best performance and scalability for the desired application scenario.<br/><br/>VLCC-States provides technical innovation in three areas. First, it introduces composable providers of intermediate states, which hide the complexity of capturing and assembling checkpoints of distributed data structures and their transformations across different modules and programming languages while optimizing their layout to eliminate redundancies, reduce sizes, and improve performance. Second, it provides multi-level co-optimized caching and prefetching techniques, which enable scalable management of the life cycle of checkpoints for interleavings of capture and reuse operations on heterogeneous storage stacks under concurrency. Third, it develops specialized checkpointing tools for large Artificial Intelligence models, with a focus on integration with PyTorch and DeepSpeed, to enable users to transparently take advantage of high-performance and scalable checkpointing using a familiar API. This project will engage partners in industry and national research laboratories to co-design VLCC-States, tune its capabilities, and evaluate its implementation. This project will undertake educational and broadening participation activities to improve community awareness and understanding of challenges in scientific data management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, organic chemists have sought to synthesize new derivatives of complex natural products of medicinal value through reactions at one particular site among many possible sites in a molecule.  There are major challenges for site selectivity in such  important late stage modifications with the potential to afford derivatives of practical value to chemistry, biology, and medicine.  The Lectka research team will approach such site selectivity through two different strategies.  The first strategy employs hydrogen bonds to guide reactivity in well-structured substrates, leading to site-selective functionalization reactions.  In the second strategy, undesirable sites in a complex substrate are deactivated through the binding of a metal ion to the fragment that needs to be neutralized. The proposed research activities will provide a strong training platform for the professional development of graduate students and research experiences for undergraduate students. Professor Lectka and his research team will partner with the JHU Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, the Pioneer Program for high school students, and the Goucher Prison Education Partnership Program in outreach to the broader local and national communities.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Lectka research team will involve directing intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and, in some cases, electron transfer (ET) to specific sites within a variety of complex molecules through two fundamental and complementary strategies.  The first strategy will employ hydrogen bonds to guide HAT and ET in well-structured substrates through functional group direction, leading to site-selective functionalization reactions to form new carbon-fluorine and carbon-carbon bonds diastereoselectively and potentially enantioselectively.  In the second strategy, undesirable sites in a complex substrate will be deactivated through the binding of a metal ion to the fragment that needs to be neutralized.  In the case of an electrophilic reaction, positive charge repulsion, induced steric effects, and electron withdrawal will provide the necessary deactivation and proof of principle.  This new approach contrasts with the traditional approach to site selectivity involving the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to react exclusively at a desired site.  Site selective functionalization in complex molecular settings is a current great challenge in chemistry motivated by the desire to be able to study and modify natural products and practical pharmaceutical targets without having to individually prepare each analogue from basic building blocks.  A new, complementary approach to siteselectivity would thus be of great import to fields such as medical and biological chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when choosing whether to have a risky, but potentially needed, medical procedure, a patient may need to consult several doctors that have different specializations, knowledge, and backgrounds, leaving the patient to aggregate this information and determine a course of action. This interdisciplinary research explores how to support individuals, organizations and governments in making better decisions through a novel approach that explores the way decision-making and information are interrelated. Decisions are shaped not only by how individuals weigh information, but also by how they weigh the information sources, such as who exactly is providing this information. Through blending advances in psychology and computer science, the project seeks to explain previously unexplainable behavior and better predict judgments in new situations. Such knowledge can facilitate decision support systems across many domains. Additionally, this research holds the potential to reveal new pathways towards translating complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems into a form that is more compatible with human cognitive processes. <br/><br/>The project proposes a new theory of judgment that fuses psychological theory with operational and theoretical advances from computer science in the areas of data aggregation and artificial intelligence. The theory of ordered judgment provides the first operational framework for empirical tests of the role of ordering in judgment and beyond, and impacts both psychological and computer science research. For psychology, the theory of ordered judgment has many implications for how to display data to facilitate accurate processing that can be useful for decision-support and human factors work in contexts ranging from graphical user interfaces to operating machinery. For computer science, this work contributes to the crucial area of explainable artificial intelligence by articulating direct links between complex computer algorithms and human reasoning. This can afford mechanisms to understand, evaluate and validate AI driven decision-making approaches in critical applications such as security and defense, energy, and healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technician will expand access to luminescence dating services for the broader Earth Science community, especially to undergraduate and graduate students. Twenty-five percent of the technician?s time is dedicated to student training, including students within PI Brown?s research group, as well as undergraduate and graduate students in his Geochronology course , and support to external visitors. The UTALL is a laboratory partner for the Advancing Geochronology Science, Spaces, and Systems (AGeS3) program, an NSF-funded initiative that provides micro-funding opportunities to pair graduate students and across the United States with geochronology laboratories. The UTALL houses several unique instruments that are unavailable elsewhere in the United States and are thus uniquely valuable to external visitors. The technician will also develop freely available software for luminescence thermochronology analysis for the broader scientific community; presently this type of analysis is only done at a few universities including UTA owing in part to a lack of software. PI Brown and the technician will demonstrate existing and developed software at the New World Luminescence Dating Workshop, an annual meeting of luminescence dating specialists, which they will host. Additionally, the technician would help maintain research facilities, develop more accessible data archiving practices, and engage in community outreach activities.<br/><br/>The technician will enhance a variety of research projects at the UTALL, the majority of which involve novel luminescence measurements of sediment or bedrock samples. Most of these projects, 18 currently planned, include graduate students, many of whom will visit the UTALL, and PIs who are early career researchers. Results from these projects will include the first measurements of ventifact erosion rates, the first luminescence ages of hydrothermal explosion deposits in Yellowstone National Park, the first luminescence-based exhumation histories of tectonic blocks in Southern California, and the first use of luminescence measurements to constrain boulder comminution on hillslopes. Other projects will determine paleoseismic records along several fault strands globally and records of ice sheet retreat in Greenland and Antarctica. The UTALL also hosts several unique analytical capabilities. It is the only US luminescence dating laboratory with a focus on luminescence thermochronology, it hosts the only infrared photo-stimulated luminescence rock slab imaging device in the US, which is used to measure sunlight exposure ages or erosion rates of hard rock surfaces. UTALL will soon host the first hydrostatic pressure vessel to test signal resetting within a luminescence dating laboratory, which the technician will help maintain and run.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Methanol produced from carbon dioxide could be used as a fuel and material feedstock, rendering this chemistry useful for rebalancing the carbon cycle (i.e. cycling the greenhouse gas CO2 to this reduced building block form). Currently copper-based catalysts are sluggish when reacting with carbon dioxide and unstable when converting it to methanol. To improve these copper-based catalysts, an templating method will be used to rapidly create and test new nanoparticle compositions and structures for catalysis. This research aims to establish a flexible and tunable method for catalyst development, including understanding the fundamental molecular interactions of the catalyst with industrially relevant materials, with the goal of increasing catalyst stability and activity. More efficient catalysts would facilitate the transition to a sustainable closed-loop fuel economy and reduce our reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels. Additionally, this research will include student training at both the graduate and undergraduate level to help prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers dedicated to addressing pressing environmental challenges. The project also provides targeted opportunities for female freshman undergraduates to begin early engagement in research and to be provided with mentors.<br/><br/>Under this award, Kara Stowers and her research team at Brigham Young University are studying the template-mediated synthesis of copper-based nanoparticle catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol. This project addresses existing catalyst weaknesses in order to improve carbon dioxide conversion and further facilitate methanol as a renewable energy carrier.  The scientific goals are to (i) optimize the interface active sites of Cu-based nanoparticles to increase catalytic activity, (ii) identify synthesis conditions that provide stability against nanoparticle aggregation, and (iii) optimize bimetallic compositions of Cu-based nanoparticles to increase reaction selectivity. The experimental approach uses spin-coating to synthesize a metal organic framework (MOF) as a thin film template at ambient pressure and temperature, which should allows for the rapid and reproducible generation of arrays of nanoparticles onto industrially relevant supports after template removal. Using MOFs as a template affords extreme flexibility in tuning of metal cluster centers and bimetallic combinations, and is expected to allow for the reproducible modification of Cu-oxide nanoparticle composition.  The team also aims to control spatial and size distributions and oxidation states within these nanoparticulate frameworks. The projected outcomes of the work are to facilitate rational design of Cu-based nanoparticle catalysts with improved catalytic activity, and with improved catalytic stability from reduced aggregation and bimetallic compositions optimized for improved catalytic efficiency. Synthesis of copper metal nanoparticles via thin films on industrially relevant supports should offer an expeditious and scalable strategy for catalyst synthesis and testing. The impact of this research on the field is expected to be in improved technologies for carbon dioxide conversion as well as in a new strategy to carry out nanoparticle assays for rapid, scalable catalyst development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is certainly the case when one studies wave turbulence theory. This theory is focused on the fundamental concept that when in a given physical system a large number of interacting waves are present, the description of an individual wave is neither possible nor relevant.  What becomes important and practical is the description of the density and the statistics of the interacting waves. Arguably the most recognizable and fundamental objects within this theory are the wave kinetic equations. These equations, their solutions and their approximations have been used to study a variety of phenomena:  water surface gravity and capillary waves,  inertial waves due to rotation and internal waves on density stratifications, which are important in the study of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Alfvén wave turbulence in solar wind; planetary Rossby waves, which are important for the study of weather and climate evolutions; waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in nonlinear optics; waves in plasmas of fusion devices; and many others. This project will tackle foundational questions in wave turbulence theory through rigorous mathematical analysis. In addition, the project will promote collaborations, facilitate the dissemination of interdisciplinary research, and provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on a multifaceted and forward-looking line of mathematical research.<br/><br/>This project tackles challenging problems at the intersection of the physics and the mathematical analysis of nonlinear interactions of waves that are central in the study of wave turbulence theory. These problems include the rigorous derivation of wave kinetic equations, the analysis of the 4-wave kinetic equation for the Fermi- Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chain and the well-posedness of a geometric wave equation via Feynman diagrams in the energy regime. The research proposed will not just address important open problems but will contribute to the interdisciplinary development of several new and complex tools both in mathematics and physics. The proposal aims at providing these tools by blending Feynman diagrams, harmonic analysis, probability, combinatorics, incidence geometry, kinetic theory, dispersive PDE, quantum field theory and the FPUT chain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its elements are precisely the symmetries of the algebraic closure of the rational numbers.  In practice, though, this group is particularly difficult to study.  There are continuum-many of these symmetries, most of which cannot be computed by any computer (or Turing machine) running any finite-length program whatsoever.  However, the symmetries that mathematicians encounter on a regular basis are essentially always computable -- perhaps because these are fundamental to the group, or perhaps just because noncomputable symmetries are naturally more difficult to examine and work with.  This project aims to determine just how much difference there is between the computable symmetries (as a group) and the larger group of all symmetries. The research work lies at the interface of logic and number theory and is likely to attract the interest of both communities. Graduate students from CUNY Graduate Center will participate in this project.<br/> <br/>An analogous situation exists with the field of all real numbers:  only countably many real numbers have computable decimal expansions, so the vast majority of real numbers are noncomputable, yet the computable ones are the only ones ever encountered in daily life.  Here, it is known that the computable real numbers form a subfield extremely similar to the full field of all real numbers, an elementary subfield with exactly the same first-order properties. This grant will fund research to attempt to determine whether Gal(Q) is analogous in this way:  do the computable symmetries form an elementary subgroup of the full group?  (Or, at a minimum, are the two elementarily equivalent?)  If so, then mathematicians should be able to determine many results about the full group just by examining the computable symmetries, which are far more accessible.  If not, that would suggest that the absolute Galois group is a thornier object than the field of real numbers, with its noncomputable symmetries somehow essential to its character.  However, even then, it is possible that the subgroup might be elementary for relatively simple properties (e.g., purely existential statements about the group), in which case this project will attempt to find the first level at which the subgroup stops imitating the full group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therapies for managing bone fragility target the maintenance of bone mass. However, bone fragility is not fully explained by bone loss but also depends on the quality of bone matrix. Osteocytes play several important roles in regulating bone matrix properties, but several urgent questions must be addressed before interventions can be designed that act on these cells to improve the bone matrix quality and the resulting tissue fracture resistance. This project will determine how osteocytes toughen bone tissue through acting on other bone cells as well as by their direct interactions with the surrounding bone matrix. Knowledge gained during this project will lay the foundation for developing a new class of therapies that target the improvement of bone matrix quality by osteocytes. The broader impacts of the work are amplified by the creation of a cohort-based program to engage nontraditional Montana State University students in engineering research; and train underrepresented, undergraduate and graduate students. Research data will be integrated into a new advanced biomechanics course as well as into core engineering courses. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER research project is to advance fundamental knowledge about the regulation of bone matrix by osteocytes. The osteocytes may influence bone matrix material properties and the resulting bone strength and fracture toughness in multiple ways. Osteocytes are well-known to indirectly determine bone matrix properties through their control of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Osteocytes may also directly determine bone matrix properties by removing and replacing their neighboring bone matrix. The first objective of this project is to determine the impacts of direct and indirect osteocyte regulatory activities on bone matrix composition, material properties, and fracture toughness. These matrix-regulatory activities are stimulated by lactation, loading, and ovariectomy models. The second objective is to define the metabolic processes that underpin different matrix regulatory activities by osteocytes. A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses will reveal how osteocytes utilize energy during activities that directly or indirectly impact bone matrix.

The integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) architectures achieve spectrum sharing between communications and sensing by encompassing just one active radio transmitter and two different receiving chains to accommodate the two functions. On the other hand, a promising technology for implementing low-power and low-cost communication is ambient backscatter communication (ABC), where a tag, often not connected to a battery or a power grid, can deliver a message to a reader by simply reflecting and modulating an incident ambient signal emitted by the radio frequency (RF) emitter of an existing legacy system. This project addresses various design aspects of a new ISAC architecture, called the RadBackCom system, which consists of a legacy radar system, and a backscatter communication system with the carrier signal being the radar clutter echoes. This research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the fields of ISAC and ABC. Practical use cases may include the exploitation of ground-based radars for air/road traffic control, environmental/weather monitoring, collision avoidance, intrusion detection, and radio imaging.<br/><br/>Specifically,  data transmission schemes will be developed when the legacy system is either a pure radar system or a dual functional radar communication (DFRC) system. When there are multiple tags transmitting data, transceiver schemes for both pilot-based sourced systems and pilot-free unsourced systems will be developed. Further, when the legacy system is assisted by a reflecting intelligent surface (RIS), several scenarios will be considered where the RIS also plays the role of an information-bearing tag, a one-bit reader, and a helper, respectively, in the RadBackCom system, and the corresponding solutions will be developed. The proposed approaches exploit an array of advanced techniques including compressed sensing, low-rank processing, simulation-based optimization, algebraic coding theory, iterative decoding, and deep neural networks, and will bring significant innovations to the theory and applications of both ISAC and ABC.

The proposed approaches will be the first of their kind to systematically identify the optimal selection and integration of modular and/or intensified process units in grassroots design or retrofit operations, which currently rely on human engineering experience. Of particular interest to this study are plant-scale bulk chemical production processes, which are among the largest energy users and carbon emitters in the domestic industrial sector.

The framework centers on a phenomena-based representation which employs general thermodynamic-based driving force constraints to quantitatively identify the optimal modular intensification opportunities at the systems level (e.g., mass/heat transfer enhancement, multi-functional task integration), while creating the opportunity to discover innovative unit and flowsheet designs that may be new to current industrial practice. The research also will generate a fundamental understanding of the impact of modular intensification on operability under uncertainty. The resulting methodology will deliver optimal and operable modular/intensified process designs by systematically addressing the interactions and trade-offs of process efficiency, economics, and operability. Key pillars of the research plan feature: (i) phenomena-based process synthesis synergizing physical laws, mathematical optimization, and machine learning to efficiently search the combinatorial design space, (ii) integrated synthesis with data-driven flexibility and controllability to generate optimal modular chemical process intensified (MCPI) designs with guaranteed operability performance, and (iii) a similarity-based clustering algorithm to automate the translation of phenomena-based solutions to unit operation-based flowsheets. The methodological developments will be demonstrated on industrially relevant case studies including ethylene glycol and methyl methacrylate production.

Combined, these efforts will broaden participation in science and provide workforce training at an under-resourced Hispanic-serving institution.  <br/><br/>Nickel systems for carbon-fluorine and sulfur-fluorine activation are not widely explored, but have the potential to provide new routes for installing fluorine on molecules for 19F labeling, silylation, and borylation. This work will probe the fundamental reactivity of nickel toward carbon-fluorine and sulfur-fluorine bonds in aryl fluorides and sulfonyl fluorides as a function of the ligand environment and resulting effects on cross-coupling reactions. A series of bidentate N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nickel complexes will be synthesized to answer the following questions: (i) How do the ligand and the substrate affect cis- versus trans-oxidative addition of carbon-fluorine or sulfur-fluorine bonds at nickel? (ii) Does cis- versus trans-oxidative addition of carbon-fluorine and sulfur-fluorine bonds at nickel affect cross-coupling reactivity for silylation and borylation catalysis? and (iii) How does nickel react with sulfonyl fluorides as compared to aryl fluorides?  These studies are expected to provide fundamental information on the structural features that confer maximal reactivity on Ni-NHC complexes for C-F and S-F bond activation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The increasing frequency of such events is alarming and naturally leads to concerns that the severity of heat waves is outpacing the rise in mean temperature.  But the extent to which the hottest days are warming faster than the average temperature increase is hard to quantify, and certainly heat waves would become more severe even if the hottest days warmed at the same rate as all the other days.  One challenge is that heat extremes are rare by definition, thus there is limited sample size to make statistically robust conclusions.  The sample size issue is particularly challenging as the extent to which the hottest days warm faster is likely to vary from one region to another. A further challenge is that we do not have a satisfactory understanding of the physical mechanisms that might lead to stronger warming trends for hot days than for average days.<br/><br/>Work under this award addresses both the extent to which temperature increases are greater for the hottest days and the physical mechanisms the might be responsible.  The analysis of temperature trends compares trends for the 50th and 95th percentiles of the temperature distribution on a regional basis and uses various statistical methods to overcome sample size limitations and account for natural variability.  The analysis also considers output from the simulations available from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Large Ensembles created with the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  Work addressing physical mechanisms focuses the extent to which drying of the soil contributes to temperature extremes, in particular that drying accompanies heat waves and drying limits the extent to which the surface can cool through evaporation and transpiration, thus leading to greater warming.  The dependence of temperature extremes on soil moisture and evapotranspiration is explored by applying a surface energy budget equation to observations and model output, and through idealized experiments with CESM.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER proposal seeks to build a bridge between climate and data science to foster more effective collaboration between the two fields.  One activity is the development of an educational module for a freshman class in environmental science intended to teach statistical thinking through hands-on data analysis.  The module uses Juypiter notebooks to give students access to observational data for their own hometowns, and guides them through the calculation of means and extremes and their variation over time.  Another activity is a workshop for 30-40 graduate students working at the interface between data science and climate science, to be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The workshop is mostly devoted to a 'science hackathon' in which teams of students with a mix of disciplinary backgrounds will work together to solve specific problems related to climate extremes. The award provides support for 20 attendees at the workshop who are chosen through an open competitive process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rare earth elements are necessary for magnets in electric motors and wind turbines while platinum group elements are essential for catalytic converters on vehicles and for advanced chemical processing, but both resources are primarily obtained from foreign sources. Mine waste rocks represent promising hosts for rare earth elements, enabling reuse of materials already removed from the ground. Similarly, zones of ore rocks exposed at Earth?s surface and materials washed into nearby streams represent potential new sources of platinum group elements. The availability of critical minerals in these resource types, and the ability to extract them, are uncertain because these materials have been weathered by the action of sun, wind, and rain. This project will investigate how weathering affects critical minerals in mine wastes and exposed ore zones at three different locations in the United States. The new insight gained will improve the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and enhance national security by evaluating new domestic critical mineral resources through collaboration with industry and government partners. The project will also aid in the development of a domestic scientific workforce by training graduate and undergraduate students in critical minerals, an area of urgent national need. Further, it will encourage high school students from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in science.<br/><br/>The primary research focus of the project is the characterization of materials from distinct critical mineral resources at Earth?s surface. Study of waste materials from the Pea Ridge mine in Missouri will determine how rare earth elements mobilize and redistribute during weathering of iron oxide-apatite tailings, including from acid generated by sulfide mineral oxidation. At the Mountain Pass mine in California, investigation of tailings will show how these same elements transform during weathering of carbonatite ore waste materials. Evaluation of weathered ore zones in the Stillwater Complex in Montana will assess how platinum group elements transform and potentially accumulate in iron oxide minerals. The project will employ advanced microanalytical characterization tools as well as X-ray techniques at synchrotron lightsources to characterize the critical mineral occurrences in these mine tailings and weathered ore zones. This research will improve our understanding of the formation of novel, domestic critical mineral resources and support increased sustainability of resource extraction in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recyclates have been unable to replace virgin plastics because of their poor mechanical performance. This leads to resource depletion, waste, and pollution challenges. Preliminary work suggests that altering the internal structure of recyclates, by introducing distinct, self-assembled phases within them, improves their mechanical performance. However, investigating the deformation and failure of these self-assembled structures, which is necessary to enable their wider adoption and use, is extremely challenging due to their complex nature. This award supports fundamental research to predict how deformation and failure occurs in recyclates through sophisticated experiments and artificial intelligence. The findings will enhance scientific understanding and foster the development of advanced, recycled materials that could benefit multiple U.S. industries, advance sustainability, and conserve national resources. In parallel, the education, outreach, and borader impact activities aim to shape a diverse and agile U.S. workforce by offering new engineering skills and improving career prospects of marginalized individuals, with emphasis on individuals reentering the workforce from incarceration. <br/><br/>This grant aims to support research that advances understanding of the deformation and failure of recyclates exhibiting self-assembled internal morphologies of improved strength and toughness through an integrated experimental and computational approach. The new mechanics discoveries by this research effort will enable the substitution of virgin plastics with recycled ones of similar mechanical performance resulting in circular transitions and addressing the pressing plastic pollution challenge. By exploiting the built-in energy potential present in immiscible polymer blends of heterogeneous recyclates, their internal architecture will be altered. This way, composites of enhanced mechanical properties with phase-separated, self-assembled three-dimensional morphologies, induced by thermophoresis, will be developed. The structure-property space of these recyclates will be explored and their complex failure and deformation will be investigated, while developing sophisticated experimental mechanics instrumentation to support such efforts. Coupling high-throughput, big-data generating experiments with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms will enable the prediction of failure evolution and the understanding of strength and toughness enhancement mechanisms. These predictions will unravel new deformation mechanisms for heterogeneous polymer composites. Such knowledge will also enable the establishment of new, reliable criteria for crack branching, curving and bifurcation, which have eluded researchers for decades. The research efforts will be closely tied to education, outreach, and broader impact activities which will work towards an integrated and inclusive mechanics education, by embedding sustainability in mechanics courses and engaging justice-impacted youth with engineering science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project seeks to couple various stoichiometric combinations of carbon dioxide and ethylene to produce a range of mono- and dicarboxylate small molecules, such as acrylates, methylmalonates, succinates and adipates.  These are chemicals with significant commercial value; through mechanistic studies the project seeks to establish pathways to control the selective production of carboxylate feedstocks.  These studies are fundamental but have elements of use-inspired research.  Thus, if successful, this research will contribute to the technology required to advance a range of current research in sustainable chemical production, including the production of fuels from CO2 and the incorporation of CO2 into renewably sourced polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is certainly the case when one studies wave turbulence theory. This theory is focused on the fundamental concept that when in a given physical system a large number of interacting waves are present, the description of an individual wave is neither possible nor relevant.  What becomes important and practical is the description of the density and the statistics of the interacting waves. Arguably the most recognizable and fundamental objects within this theory are the wave kinetic equations. These equations, their solutions and their approximations have been used to study a variety of phenomena:  water surface gravity and capillary waves,  inertial waves due to rotation and internal waves on density stratifications, which are important in the study of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Alfvén wave turbulence in solar wind; planetary Rossby waves, which are important for the study of weather and climate evolutions; waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in nonlinear optics; waves in plasmas of fusion devices; and many others. This project will tackle foundational questions in wave turbulence theory through rigorous mathematical analysis. In addition, the project will promote collaborations, facilitate the dissemination of interdisciplinary research, and provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on a multifaceted and forward-looking line of mathematical research.<br/><br/>This project tackles challenging problems at the intersection of the physics and the mathematical analysis of nonlinear interactions of waves that are central in the study of wave turbulence theory. These problems include the rigorous derivation of wave kinetic equations, the analysis of the 4-wave kinetic equation for the Fermi- Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chain and the well-posedness of a geometric wave equation via Feynman diagrams in the energy regime. The research proposed will not just address important open problems but will contribute to the interdisciplinary development of several new and complex tools both in mathematics and physics. The proposal aims at providing these tools by blending Feynman diagrams, harmonic analysis, probability, combinatorics, incidence geometry, kinetic theory, dispersive PDE, quantum field theory and the FPUT chain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such digital systems include storage systems and search engine as well as web services. Spreading out digital systems across machines has multiple benefits including (1) the ability to survive machine failures by moving computation to a different machine and (2) the ability to leverage the capabilities of multiple machines to finish computations faster. To realize these benefits, the machines within a distributed system must coordinate amongst themselves to ensure the result is identical to an idealised illusion of executing the computation on a single machine. This project will make coordination significantly faster by developing a new abstraction, deadline-ordered multicast (DOM), which combines: (1) Multicast: The ability to simultaneously transmit a message from a sender to multiple receivers and (2) Synchronized clocks: Technology to ensure that, at any instant, clocks on various machines display the same value of time and that these clocks progress in lock step with each other.   The project will demonstrate how DOM can be used to accelerate widely used computer systems, such as distributed databases, coordination services, and blockchains. The project will also train both undergraduate and graduate students using a variety of approaches to understand the benefits of synchronized clocks when thinking about distributed systems. <br/><br/>Distributed systems are at the heart of computing today and include widely used systems such as distributed databases, fault-tolerant key-value stores, and distributed ledgers. At the core of these systems are distributed protocols such as crash-fault-tolerant consensus, concurrency control, and Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus. Much effort has been expended on improving the performance of distributed protocols over the years including recent efforts that leverage richer network services to improve distributed protocols. Such services include switch multicast, programmable switches, programmable network-interface cards, in-network priority queues, and control over routing. However, many distributed systems today are deployed by cloud tenants, who have no access to such rich network services, making it impossible for them to benefit from the improved protocol performance enabled by such rich network services.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new network primitive called deadline-ordered multicast (DOM) that will make it easier to construct high-performance distributed protocols on the public cloud. DOM leverages 2 key techniques: (1) the recent availability of synchronized clocks as a service, which now permit tightly synchronized clocks in the public cloud and (2) multicast, which struggled to find traction in the Internet, but is ideal for the one-sender-multi-receiver communication at the heart of distributed systems. DOM delivers a multicast message from a sender to multiple receivers at or after a message's deadline and delivers multiple messages in deadline order. DOM provides a consistent order (the order of deadlines) in which different receivers process a set of messages, accelerating several distributed protocols in the process. This proposal will develop the DOM abstraction, design an optimized DOM service, and prototype several applications demonstrating DOM's value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At these frequencies, multi-antenna transceiver (TRX) arrays are key in overcoming the high path-loss and boosting the signal-to-noise ratio, critical for maintaining robust communications. Unlike single-antenna systems, designing large multi-antenna arrays entails significant challenges due to (i) mismatches and non-idealities, and (ii) the large number of control parameters. Existing arrays mostly rely on look-up-tables (LUTs) and offline compensation. Such static solutions, however, can neither capture all possible operation modes nor provide real-time adaptivity to the propagation conditions and communications/sensing tasks. This collaborative research project with Swiss researchers at ETH Zürich will result in novel intelligent large-scale multi-antenna array architectures with highly reconfigurable 140 GHz frontends. Unlike today's systems that are blind to imbalances and mismatches in the array, or only make static corrections, employing detectors and adaptive array calibration/beamforming will result in an adaptive array, thus performing better as conditions evolve, and lowering the cost to calibrate a large array. The research will directly impact applications in beyond-5G and 6G communications, sub-mm-wave radar, and next-generation satellite/intersatellite links. To disseminate research results, the project will provide open access to the array models, array calibration/beamforming codes, and array demonstration measurements.<br/><br/>The ULTRA (Ubiquitous Large inTelligent arRAys) project aims at addressing large-array design challenges with a holistic approach that jointly considers mm-wave electronics, antenna arrays, digital baseband processing, and calibration algorithms. The main objective is to design large and scalable array architectures at D-band 140GHz with intelligent calibration as well as adaptive in-field beamforming. The work is divided in several thrusts, including Analytical and Behavior Modeling of Non-idealities in Large Scalable Arrays, Designing Reconfigurable D-Band Frontends as Performance Tuning ""Knobs"", Designing Non-Intrusive D-Band Frontends Performance ""Sensors"", Blind Array Calibration and Beamforming Algorithms, and ULTRA 140-GHz Array System Integration and Demonstration. Both beam-independent non-idealities (e.g., phase/gain/power mismatches) and beam-dependent non-idealities (e.g., antenna coupling/crosstalk) will be modeled. For array antenna load compensation, a reconfigurable load-modulated-balanced-amplifier transmitter and a Marchand balun receiver with non-foster terminations will be investigated. D-band orthogonal phase/gain tuning blocks will also be explored. Non-intrusive in-situ real-power and impedance detectors will be used to detect antenna mismatches/coupling (beam-dependent non-idealities). Transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) loopbacks will measure gain/phase/power mismatches (beam-independent non-idealities) in array elements. Signal processing and machine learning algorithms for blind, on-the-fly array calibration and residual impairment compensation will be pursued. Digital beamforming methods that adapt their key parameters to the instantaneous channel conditions and calibration/beamforming algorithms will be implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototyping boards to interface with the D-band TRX array for offline/online close-loop operation of the ULTRA system.

The flow of polymer melts dictates a wide range of societal impacts, including: the enormous energy consumption associated with polymer processing; the range of polymers that can be efficiently manufactured; the properties and performance of products, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and coatings; and, the recycling of plastics products. As a result, additives are used to influence the flow properties of polymer melts. The global market for these products, termed ?rheology modifiers,? currently exceeds $7 billion/yr. <br/>Numerous challenges motivate the development of new, generalizable and scalable strategies for rheology modifiers that give enhanced performance at lower loading and can be tailored for a broad range of applications. Drivers include: growing awareness of the potential health and environmental impacts of rheology modifier leaching; increased global focus on energy efficiency; emergence of new manufacturing technologies ? especially additive manufacturing ? with bespoke rheological requirements; recognition of the need for improved recycling pathways. Supramolecular polymers, in which the molecular units are held together by reversible bonds, combine the softening effects of molecular additives at the high temperatures used for the production of plastics with the typical polymer-like behavior that imparts plastic materials their useful mechanical properties at ambient temperature. This project will combine the structural control of supramolecular polymers developed by Shenhar with the rheological expertise developed by Craig to pursue fundamental principles that will unlock this new class of rheology modifiers.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project tackles critical, fundamental questions about the rheological modifications that are possible through the blending of supramolecular polymers into traditional polymer melts. A combination of synthesis and characterization will be used to test and refine quantitative structure-activity relationships for this relatively unexplored set of materials. Supramolecular polymers represent a promising and untapped material class for next-generation rheology modifiers. Supramolecular polymers combine the plasticizing effects of low-molecular weight additives with a rich combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology that can be tuned through molecular structure. Despite their promise, supramolecular polymers are largely unutilized as rheology modifiers. The research plan seeks to provide new and generalizable principles for the rheology of these new blends of two material classes. The proposed work seeks: (i) to develop a robust understanding of the unique rheology of each supramolecular component, including the heretofore unexplored rheology of their respective melt phases; (ii) to characterize the rheology of blends of supramolecular and covalent components, establishing design principles through which the supramolecular polymer confers unique rheological behavior to the covalent melt; (iii) to explore supramolecular blending as a facilitator of melt extrusion and additive manufacturing (3D printing) of traditionally intractable polymers. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in addressing the falling challenge by using computer simulations when teaching robots how to walk. However, the robot behaviors learned in simulation often underperform in the real world due to the difference between the simulation and the real physical robot. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research that investigates a novel approach that simultaneously learns from both simulated and physical experiments. This novel approach in this project aims to leverage the advantage of simulations, such as scalability, while using the data from real robots. Ultimately, the project will maximize the potential of AI and robot learning algorithms to allow more capable and safer robots. Additionally, the project incorporates educational activities to engage students with real-world robot learning environments, fostering a broader understanding of robotics.<br/><br/>This project will investigate a novel class of learning algorithms, Learning from Multiverse (LfM), which concurrently learns from both large-scale, inexpensive physics-based simulation and expensive, real world ground-truths to bridge the well-known ?sim-to-real? gap in legged robots.

The research effort involves material design with computer simulations, synthesis of ultra-pure defect-free semiconductors, as well as structural and optical material characterization. This project also combines material research with educational and outreach activities that aim to increase learning opportunities for students of all ages, inside and outside the traditional classroom. The investigators and students involved in this project participate in outreach activities organized either in-house or at local schools to increase exposure of K-12 students and the general public to modern scientific topics in materials science in a fun, project-oriented environment. Lesson plans are designed and experimental demonstrations of basic optical properties of matter are built for the middle-school summer camp ?Physics Inside Out? at Purdue. To maximize impact at the high-school level, the activities engage teachers in summer research. In particular, the teachers are developing inquiry-based lesson plans incorporating concepts related to quantum science into the high-school curriculum. The researchers also design hands-on activities with take-home materials for the annual meeting of the Hoosier Association of Science Teachers.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The principal objective of this project is to establish wurtzite ScAlN as a viable photonic platform for novel infrared applications.  This project exploits the unique native properties of ferroelectric ScAlN and further manipulates them within designed structures to facilitate utilization of the near-infrared range of the spectrum. In particular, optical transitions between quantized states in the conduction band of near lattice-matched ScAlN/GaN heterostructures are utilized to expand device capabilities to generate, detect, and modulate infrared light. III-nitride semiconductors have unique electronic properties that make them suitable for advancing the functionality of semiconductor devices into spectral ranges currently inaccessible with other material systems. The innovative approach employs the emergent photonic material Sc-Al-nitride to mitigate strain-related issues that have impeded progress of nitride photonics into the infrared in the past. The research effort is interdisciplinary and involves material design and growth, structural characterization, and optical characterization. ScAlN/GaN heterostructures are designed using extensive band-structure calculations. To achieve maximum material purity and monolayer-control of the atomic structure, the Sc-containing materials are grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on high quality quasi-bulk GaN substrates. A central task is to identify the epitaxial growth conditions that satisfy the most stringent requirements imposed by near-infrared optical processes. To correlate microstructure with optical and electronic properties, the structure of the semiconductor materials is comprehensively characterized with high-resolution x-ray diffraction, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, and atom-probe tomography. The band structure of the materials is probed experimentally with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The research contributes to the fundamental understanding of the physics of intersubband optical transitions and nonlinear optical processes. These infrared materials are expected to immediately enable emitters and photodetectors with functionality unmatched by current technologies (wider spectral range, higher speeds, and better temperature performance). They are also ideal candidates for photonic integrated circuits as well as monolithic integration with Si electronics. Successful second-harmonic generation on chip opens avenues for other nonlinear processes such as difference frequency generation and parametric down-conversion. Moreover, the novel Sc-containing semiconductors are beneficial for other applications in electronic (e.g. high-electron mobility transistors), ultraviolet, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and plasmonic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the research team combines organic molecules with 2D layered crystals to realize high temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of excitons. The BEC is a macroscopic quantum state that has many interesting properties such as frictionless transport. The macroscopic nature of the BEC makes it suitable for quantum information science applications. Currently, because BECs typically exist only in ultracold (< 1 K) atomic gases, the applications for  BECs are limited. The project aims to produce BECs in solid-state semiconductors at a much higher temperature (> 100 K) so that its novel properties would be utilized in more conventional electronic devices. The project trains undergraduate and graduate students in nanoscale material design, fabrication, and characterization in a collaborative environment. Emphasis is placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Outreach activities to the public include a summer camp for K-12 students and outreach seminars.<br/><br/>Technical description: Compared to 2D/2D heterostructures, the molecular lattice in molecule/2D heterostructures can provide added tunability to the electronic structure. The team utilizes functionalities of molecules to build periodic trapping potentials for interlayer excitons with a period as small as 1 ? 2 nanometers. Using this approach, we aim to increase the density of excitons by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude as compared to the maximum exciton density achievable in 2D/2D heterostructures. A high density of trapped excitons can enable us to realize the BEC phase at higher temperatures (> 100 K). Moreover, steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy and microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and time-correlated photon counting techniques will be used to characterize and understand BEC?s optical and transport properties. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the coherent photon emission and the dissipationless transport of the BEC at high temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although Na-O2 batteries are promising, limited long-term stability, and lack of fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the mechanisms that govern durability, have impeded progress. The PIs seek to address this challenge by combining experimental and theoretical studies. The insights from the work will lead to a general framework that can guide the design of the cathode/electrolyte interfaces to enable stable cycling of discharge products for Na-O2 batteries. Also, the PIs will partner with local K-12 students in the Metro Detroit area and West Lafayette, IN to involve economically disadvantaged students in summer research internships and student research exchanges. <br/><br/>Aprotic Na-O2 batteries have gained significant attention as viable alternatives to commercial Li-ion batteries. Owing to their high theoretical energy densities and reversible redox chemistries, Na-O2 batteries offer opportunities to achieve high discharge capacities and low charge overpotentials by controlling the nature of discharged products at the cathode. While this technology is very attractive, maintaining stability of Na-O2 batteries is a significant challenge. In the present project, PIs Nikolla and Greeley seek to alleviate this issue by developing a combined experimental/theoretical approach to advance understanding of the deactivation mechanisms of Na-O2 cells driven by changes at the cathode/electrolyte interface, with the goal of improving cell cyclability.  The research plan will involve: (i) determining the factors that govern deactivation and byproduct formation, both as a function of electrochemical potential and under resting conditions (no applied current), in Na-O2 batteries, (ii) elucidating the effect of incorporating oxide electrocatalysts to tune the product formation at the cathode of Na-O2 battery cells, so as to minimize cell deactivation, and (iii) developing a general framework to guide the design of cathode/electrolyte interfaces that result in stable cycling of Na-O2 batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ants are highly invasive; originally native to Brazil, they have been inadvertently transported via ships across the globe and have established footholds in North and Central America, several Caribbean islands, Asia, Australia, and have very recently (as of September 2023) been found in Europe. Studies over the past several decades have noted their significant negative impacts on the health and diversity of local wildlife (including crops and livestock) and their great potential for further expansion, making them the focus of many failed eradication attempts since their introduction into the US nearly 100 years ago. While nests are crucial for a colony's survival, nest size and soil opacity have prevented detailed investigation or theoretical understanding. In this project, the PI will use experimental and computational techniques to establish links between the nest structures, functions, and organization in the red imported fire ant by focusing on the following questions: (1) what can be inferred about below-ground nest structures from above-ground dynamics? (2) how are subterranean nests organized? and (3) how do environmental factors influence subterranean nest networks? A new experimental technique developed in the PI?s laboratory will provide, for the first time, spatially resolved quantification of the internal structure and organization within large-scale natural and lab-created nests. Though most of the nest is below-ground, a mound is created atop the nest through the repeated placement of soil pellets above ground. A custom-built surface scanner provides quantitative three-dimensional data of the above-ground mound formation dynamics that accompany nest construction. This combined approach provides the first ever data of this kind and will help elucidate the physical and biological principles underlying natural nest construction, organization, and adaptability in a highly successful species of master builders.

Given the ongoing disappearance of tropical forests, many pinhole borers may already be extinct. This project will summarize what is known about these beetles and their symbiotic fungi while generating new data about them using modern DNA sequencing and microscopy technologies. Because the lack of taxonomists working on pinhole borers and their symbiotic fungi is a biosecurity gap for the U.S ? both the beetles and the fungi can become pests ? this project will train graduate and undergraduate students as the next generation of entomologists and mycologists. Outreach goals include the broad dissemination of accurate information about wood borers through curating information on Wikipedia, and a specific campaign to encourage homeowners in the United States to retain dead wood on their properties as a refuge of biodiversity in urban landscapes.<br/><br/>This project will undertake a simultaneous revision of two symbiont groups that are charismatic, important, and sometimes pestiferous, but suffer from the typical taxonomic impediments. The main goals of the project are to identify, classify and describe the pinhole borer beetles and their symbiotic fungi, in addition to documenting the many interactions between these two groups and the trees in which they live. Attaining these aims are enabled by phylogenetically analyzing DNA sequence data from thousands of individuals and collecting new morphological data using photographs and microscopy to identify beetle-fungus interactions.

While global reductions in CO2 emissions are necessary, CO2 emissions from cement production have increased 1.5% per year from 2015-2021. Two thirds of the global increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in 2019 were attributed to cement production. Improving the durability of new concrete structures is a critical strategy for reducing GHG emissions. Although proper air entrainment is critical for concrete frost durability, conventional air entrainment methods are often ineffective in modern-day mixes. As concrete technology continues to develop at a rapid rate, and as novel alternatives to traditional concrete emerge, a more robust air entrainment solution is needed; one that can overcome known adverse interactions and can be adapted for increasingly complex systems. This work will explore the hypothesis that Pickering stabilization can be used instead of/in addition to current air entrainment approaches for exceptional bubble stability and size control, accelerating adoption of low-carbon building materials without sacrificing their long-term durability and thus sustainability. This research will be integrated into a K-12 education/outreach (EO) program to enrich research, education, and outreach experiences simultaneously. The goal of the EO plan is to develop a diverse, research-literate workforce that can leverage their unique experiences and perspectives to introduce creative, impactful solutions for change. This work will develop the workforce by building a diverse pipeline through a research-integrated K-12 education and outreach program, an undergraduate/graduate training program focused on best practice in inclusive pedagogy and community building, and an annual concrete career week that will introduce grade 8-12 students to hands-on research experience from the work and 5 other concrete career options via facility tours with industry professionals.<br/><br/>The project will use molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and experiments to test the hypothesis and develop a fundamental model to describe the mechanisms controlling Pickering stabilization of air bubbles in cementitious systems.

Most commodity and fine chemicals are synthesized utilizing catalytic chemistry, with 2nd row transition metals being used to catalyze bond formations to carbon most commonly. Many of these metals are in low abundance and expensive; so-called precious metals. This research is directed at developing more sustainable alternative chemistries; namely by establishing ways of utilizing more abundant metals that are modified by ligands to provide the chemical reactivity necessary to supplant the current catalysts. Transformative ligands that expand the scope of applications via unique reactivity are a cornerstone of the program. A number of approaches involving different metal-ligand binding modes, and different electronic capabilities are expected to allow for the effective modulation of catalyst reactivity. One specific application is the synthesis of simple coordination complexes to enable light-initiated processes to occur more sustainably and with greater facility. An internet program/website will be established to provide a forum for Q&A for the community, and to serve as a news interface with the general public. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of inorganic and organometallic chemistry in the synthesis and reactivity of transition metal compounds. As an ancillary effort an oral history organometallic chemistry will be assembled and made accessible through the internet.<br/><br/>The coordination of strong field and redox non-innocent (RNI) ligands will be utilized with the goal of expanding the redox capability of targeted 1st transition series metals. The goal is the development of catalytic properties of these metals that are typical of 2nd and 3rd row metals. As strong fields impart covalency, bidentate pyrimidine-based chelates featuring anionic or neutral M-C bonds will be employed as inductively withdrawing ligands. As these complexes are predicted to have low-lying pi-antibonding orbitals and corresponding low-lying charge-transfer (CT) excited states, the complexes have potential applications as photoactive materials in photocatalysis. Reversible C-C bond breaking will be employed in low coordinate complexes to restrict RNI to 2e- changes. Chromium tetradentate chelates manifest chemistry that provides proof of this concept. New chelates with sterically/electronically protected components will hamper degradation and stabilize ligand platforms that will enable CH activation through transient imide/nitrene complexation. Non-ancillary ligands based on benzimidazole diamides will be used to reversibly mask alkylidenes that are capable of ring-opening metathesis polymerization and olefin metathesis.

Intestinal mucus is the first line of microbial defense. A wide range of human gut disorders can be caused by biofilm invading the mucus. This is a challenging problem to study due to complex interlinked factors of how mucus molecules assemble, how bacteria adhere to mucus, and how mucosal biofilm is shed in the human gut. This research project will use computational modeling and simulations to obtain nanoscale insights on these factors. These insights will help to accelerate the design of mucoadhesive therapeutics or antimicrobials for treating human gut disorders. The research program will also bridge pathways towards multidisciplinary graduate education for undergraduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, by integrating engineering, biological, and humanistic sciences through an online project-based summer course, the curriculum of the nonprofit educational organization, Station1, and the Cornell University?s Future Leaders in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering (FLAME) program. <br/><br/>The specific objectives of this research program are to use computational modeling and simulations to: 1) determine how the supramolecular assembly of mucins is altered by disease-related changes in glycan compositions and structures, and bacterial enzymatic degradation of glycans, 2) uncover the molecular mechanisms of bacterial adhesion on mucus surfaces, to investigate why glycan assemblies in enzymatically degraded and unhealthy mucins will have greatly differing bacterial binding characteristics compared to healthy mucins, and 3) unravel the effects of mucoadhesion on bacterial growth in mucus to probe how biofilms adhere to mucus and proliferate under the influence of mucus degradation and physiological mucus clearance. The mechanistic insights from this project will help to accelerate the design of mucoadhesive materials for drug delivery or antimicrobials for the human gut by revealing the supramolecular structures of mucus and their glycans, unraveling how bacteria recognize and adhere to highly heterogenous glycan domains, and determining how these differences in adhesive characteristics ultimately affect the shedding dynamics of mucosal biofilms.

Chemical reactions that produce commercial products and experimental new materials can create a heavy economic and environmental burden. When these reactions are catalyzed by small quantities of precious metals (e.g. platinum, gold, iridium), these burdens can be lessened. However, obtaining and removing these precious metals can create their own environmental, economic and political problems. This research seeks to replace precious metal catalysts with earth abundant metal catalysts such as iron. Through this work, old chemical reactions and existing materials can be made with fewer negative impacts. In addition, these catalysts enable new chemical reactions and novel materials that are unavailable to precious metals. Through these efforts, a diverse body of graduate students will be trained to enter the science and technology workforce.  Chemical outreach activities from the Shenvi group to community schools are planned to engage the next generation of science and technical professionals.<br/><br/>Alkene cross-coupling traditionally involves precious metal complexes that undergo sequential two- electron, inner-sphere reactions. These pathways involve sequential activations of substrate in which the metal center bonds covalently to intermediates: oxidative addition, coordination, migratory insertion, ?- hydride elimination, decomplexation. Each of these steps can restrict the substrate scope, especially the alkene coordination step, whose rate decreases with increased alkene substitution due to steric repulsion. A lesser studied alkene reaction pathway involves metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT), a subset of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). This outer-sphere elementary step generates a carbon- centered radical directly from an alkene without the need for redox-active auxiliaries or trialkyltin hydrides. In contrast to inner-sphere, coordinative metal-hydride reactions that decelerate with increasing alkene substitution, MHAT reactions can occur at high rates on tetrasubstituted alkenes or amidst steric crowding, even in dilute aqueous buffer among tertiary amines and biomolecules like DNA. The proposed research will study and expand a novel class of MHAT-based alkene functionalization reactions in which a base metal catalyst mediates bond formation at each olefinic carbon without any intermediate metal-carbon bond formation. Problems at the intersection of reactive intermediate chemistry, complex molecule synthesis and ligand design will be addressed through this work. New bioactive materials, chemical reactions and catalyst insights are expected to result from this research into catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All-solid-state batteries utilizing solid state electrolytes along with Li-metal anode are notable for their improved safety and potential to achieve simultaneously high energy, power, and longevity. Ionogels, formed by confinement of ionic liquids within ionic conductive polymers and/or ceramics, show a unique combination of favorable properties as solid electrolytes. However, their achievable power density and cycling stability remains notably inferior, owing primarily to the lack of understanding of Li-ion transport mechanisms. The project will develop a series of designed three-phase ionogel systems where each phase will be modified to promote fast Li-ion transport. The mechanistic understanding will elucidate the true Li-ion transport path and tortuosity, guiding the design of structure and chemistry of ionogel-based solid electrolytes and interlayers for high performance solid-state batteries. In addition, this project will integrate research and education for fostering interdisciplinary learnings in STEM areas. Education in Energy Storage and Conversion technology will raise more awareness of carbon neutrality and inspire younger generations to explore technical solutions for a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the local Li-ion transport mechanisms influenced by the interaction of different lithophilic environments within ternary ionogel solid electrolytes. The lithophilic molecular environments will be created through ternary ionogel platforms composed of ionic liquid where moving anions can coordinate with Li-ions, polymer scaffolds functionalized with different lithophilic groups which weakly coordinate with Li-ions for rapid Li-ion transport across and along the polymer phase, as well as ceramic nanofillers grafted with lithophilic ligands for facile Li-ion transport along the ceramic phase. These mechanistic understandings will elucidate a) the types of association and dissociation between Li cations and lithophilic anions and the competitive or cooperative interaction between them; b) the true Li-ion dissociation and Li-ion transport at different intrinsic interphases, which will determine the efficient Li-ion transport pathways and tortuosity within the ternary ionogel solid electrolyte featuring diverse intrinsic interphases; and c) the conversion from bi-ion conducting to single-ion conducting systems through effective immobilization of anions by the functional ligands grafted to the ceramic phase.

Prior research on this topic investigates racial and gender disparities in access to STEM course taking and test scores in K-12.  This has implications for unequal access to STEM prior to the end of high school for subsequent educational and labor market trajectories. In contrast, this CAREER research will take the less common approach of describing the college and career pathways of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White women and men who graduate from high school with equivalent STEM course taking and test scores. The goal is to investigate the magnitude and mechanisms of potential racial and gender disparities in the returns to comparable K-12 STEM opportunity and preparation. The research study will describe potential racial and gender differences among such students across the subsequent outcomes of obtaining a STEM college degree and working in a STEM industry. The research will focus intensively on the potential for intersecting racial and gender differences in college and career pathways of those with equivalent K-12 STEM preparation. The project contributes to the understanding of for whom and under what circumstances early life investments in STEM education later pay off economically.  Findings can point to mechanisms underlying potential disparities in such returns. These are crucial insights at a time when STEM skills and credentials are increasingly important for one?s life chances in today?s knowledge economy.<br/><br/>The research will draw upon state-level administrative data from Texas covering the high school graduating classes of 2008-2013, with students followed into higher education and the labor market.

Potentially unequal returns to K-12 STEM preparation will be assessed across three outcomes, measured up to ten years after high school graduation: 1) probability of obtaining a STEM college degree, 2) STEM intensity of industry of employment, and 3) annual wages. The research will also develop a decomposition model of race-gender differences in the wage return to K-12 STEM preparation. The model intends to help explain differences in choice of and returns to STEM degrees and STEM-intensive industries among those with equivalent preparation. This project will implement and evaluate an online course plug-in to help college students emphasize their STEM skills and link their courses of study to careers. The effort is based on a working hypotheses and preliminary findings showing that a relatively large number of women and Black and Hispanic students with strong K-12 STEM preparation opt for social science courses of study in college.

A major obstacle is that the high variability inherent in civil structures causes laboratory-developed algorithms to struggle without expert guidance. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to address this issue. This work introduces an approach to translating raw, multi-source sensor data into functional analytical models which realistically represent the as-built structural behavior. Three data types are considered: spatial data from images and laser scanning, non-destructive evaluation data such as ground penetrating radar, and response data from accelerometers and strain gages. In addition, the methodology introduces the use of a structural ontology (a graphical map of structural component relationships) as a way to encode domain knowledge in a way a computer can understand. This creates a link between specialized sensor measurements and broader functional models, with reduced input from an engineer. It is envisioned that the results of the research would support various future applications in infrastructure assessment, including the creation of digital twins. These anchor sensor data to an analytical model of the structure, enabling practicing engineers to interpret physical behavior more effectively, run simulations, and facilitating asset management decision. <br/><br/>The technical approach of this work addresses three open research problems: (1) model-oriented identification of structural components from spatial and non-destructive evaluation data, (2) reasoning on encoded domain knowledge to establish structural component relationships, (3) fusing response data with component information to represent as-built behavior. To address (1) and (2), the framework uniquely combines a structural engineering ontology (domain knowledge) and probabilistic graphical models (reasoning) using a machine learning framework. It begins by identifying individual structural components (e.g. beams, reinforcement) in the data, then reasoning on their relationships and functions in 3D space. Thus, the diverse and noisy information obtained from computer vision techniques (e.g., component types, geometry) can be synthesized into a candidate structure that makes contextual sense. To address (3), candidate structures are combined with response data (accelerations, strains) via system identification techniques to infer unobservable properties such as boundary conditions, material properties, and connection stiffnesses.  The final output is a calibrated model capable of analysis through standard tools like finite elements. In parallel, this work integrates research products into core engineering courses. Students will interact directly with the data, learning how create structural models of real-world structures while learning about AI and its applications in civil engineering. The structural ontology will be leveraged an interactive learning guide, allowing students to explore structural relationships as they work on a problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These nanobubbles are highly sensitive to pressure changes and can release their contents when exposed to sound waves. Although these ultrasound-responsive nanobubbles hold promise for delivering drugs or aiding in medical imaging, their production with nanometer size and uniform size distribution has been challenging. This award supports fundamental research to develop a new method, called ultrasonic shearing, to create uniform-sized nanobubbles that can be tuned for size and chemistry as needed. The method integrates ultrasonication and shearing using an impeller to achieve monodispersed nanobubbles. This advancement could lead to large-scale manufacturing of nanobubbles with applications in biomedicine, such as gene and drug delivery for diseases such as osteoporosis. Additionally, this technology could enhance wastewater treatment systems by improving processes like oxygen transfer and air flotation, thereby reducing pollution. The project also includes educational efforts to increase the understanding of scalable nanobubble manufacturing and their biomedical applications, particularly among women and underrepresented minority groups, aiming to contribute to both scientific progress and societal benefits as well as the development of a skilled workforce.<br/><br/>Various nanobubble sizes exhibit distinct behaviors, yet understanding their synthesis remains limited due to the absence of an efficient manufacturing method allowing precise size and size distribution control. Furthermore, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge on the relationship between the processing parameters and the acoustic properties of nanobubbles. This research advances nanobubble manufacturing methods by investigating the ultrasonic shearing mechanism, employing a combination of computational modeling and experimental methodologies. The inherent energy dynamics in the manufacturing process is simulated by calculating ultrasonic shear energy and nanobubble surface energy. Through the empirical assessment of temperature shifts within the emulsion, a correlation is established between the droplet vaporization and energy derived from ultrasonic shearing. Integrating this model with the ultrasonic shearing method enables the development of systems capable of tailoring nanobubble size as a function of ultrasonic shearing, incorporating variables such as ultrasound intensity, shearing rate, and process duration. This technique can generate programmable nanobubbles with controlled cargo release mechanisms. Additionally, the research aims to identify nanobubble subpopulations with enhanced responsiveness to ultrasound using tissue-mimicking materials for medical imaging applications. Finally, the project explores the interplay between ultrasonic shearing, therapeutic-encapsulated nanobubbles, and cellular dynamics, particularly in osteoporosis, to uncover potential therapeutic approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials host several novel and highly tunable states of matter, each with transformative potential across different science and technology sectors. Modeling these systems is incredibly challenging, however, and often requires the development and use of advanced computational methods. This project focuses on performing state-of-the-art numerical simulations of quantum materials where the electrons interact strongly with the motion of the atoms. While these interactions are believed to play a key role in different families of quantum materials, previous numerical studies have often concentrated on oversimplified models with unrealistic parameters primarily for various technical reasons. This aspect has generally prevented the scientific community from obtaining definitive answers to how these interactions influence the properties of different materials. The PI?s team will leverage new simulation capabilities to perform detailed simulations of different quantum materials while including realistic descriptions of the interactions between the electrons and lattice of atoms that form the material. The team will also provide predictions for various spectroscopic measurements to guide future experiments on these materials. Combined, this project will help identify organizing principles for quantum materials and facilitate their use in future scientific and technological applications. <br/><br/>This project will also broaden participation in computational science and provide training in cutting-edge computational methods to enhance the scientific workforce. For example, the PI?s team will develop new training materials and open-source codes for performing numerical simulations of quantum materials, which will be disseminated in partnership with the University of Tennessee?s Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing, an NSF MRSEC center. Finally, the PI will continue existing efforts aimed at increasing opportunities for underrepresented minorities in physics through partnerships with the APS Bridge and Nuclear Physics in Eastern Tennessee programs.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>Understanding the properties of strongly correlated quantum materials is a forefront challenge for the scientific community. These materials often host strong electron-electron and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, which produce correlated electron liquids that defy theoretical descriptions based on single-particle theories. Modeling their behavior often requires nonperturbative numerical methods; however, addressing realistic e-ph interactions remains as a key challenge. This project addresses this problem by applying state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods to study broad classes of models for quantum materials hosting strong e-ph interactions, leveraging a new open-source implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) algorithm developed by the PI?s group. This code can simulate a broad class of Hamiltonians and uses hybrid Monte Carlo methods to sample the phonon fields efficiently and overcome the long autocorrelation times typically associated with these simulations. The PI and his team will use these capabilities to perform numerically exact simulations of models beyond the canonical Holstein model with physically realistic descriptions of the phonon subsystem. Specifically, they will study how the e-ph coupling influences the emergent properties of materials ranging from unconventional superconductors to kagome metals to graphene-derived systems. They will also predict spectroscopic measurements on such systems to guide experimental studies and provide crucial validation of their results. A particular focus for this project is on generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like e-ph interactions, where the atomic motion couples the electron?s kinetic energy via a modulation of the overlap integral. This interaction has been linked to novel phenomena ranging from mobile (bi)polarons, high-temperature superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, novel charge or bond orders, and topological states of matter. <br/><br/>This project will also broaden participation in computational science and provide training in cutting-edge computational methods to enhance the scientific workforce.

Though these soils account for only 2% of soil globally, they have a disproportionately large impact on water quantity and quality due to their shrink-swell properties, which lead to the formation of cracks that in turn strongly influence key hydrologic processes including water and contaminant transport, infiltration, runoff, and plant water use. Currently, there are no ways of predicting the cracking behavior of these soils or including the effects of these cracks in model simulations. The goal of this research is to improve our ability to measure and predict crack formation in shrink-swell soils, with the ultimate goal of improving models of water flow in soils. This will allow us to better manage and predict the movement of water and pollutants within the environment. In addition, the project will include training opportunities for K-12 teachers to learn about soil science activities and lessons, with the goal of attracting students to the field at a young age.<br/><br/>To date, the dynamic physical properties of shrink-swell soils have not been adequately quantified beyond individual sites. Further, theoretical models describing the soil water content-bulk density relationship depend on empirical parameters that lack physical meaning. To address this gap, this project will integrate multiple proven, non-invasive geophysical measurement types at several locations to allow for the accurate field-scale quantification of the soil water content-bulk density relationship. The goal of the proposed research is to improve understanding of and ability to quantify dynamic properties of shrink-swell soils at the field scale by providing a physically-based, non-site-specific representation of the soil water content-bulk density relationship. This objective will be reached using the following objectives: 1) Quantify the relationship between soil moisture and bulk density at the field scale in shrink-swell soils at multiple sites, 2) Quantify the number and size of soil cracks based on surface and subsurface imagery, and 3) Produce field-scale estimates of effective soil hydraulic parameters for characterizing soil shrinkage, swelling, and crack development. The educational objectives of the proposed work are to 1) Broaden participation in soil and Earth sciences by hosting multiple train-the-trainer soil science education workshops for K-12 educators, and 2) incorporate project findings into an existing open-source introductory soil physics textbook. This research will provide a physically-based theoretical model of the soil water content-bulk density relationship at the field scale and lay a foundation for the integration of that model into existing numerical models. This will allow for the dynamic representation of the presence and size of cracks in areas with shrink-swell soils, improving estimates of infiltration, surface runoff, and soil water storage.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Education and Human Resources programs in NSF's Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this, continual learning (CL) aims to build AI models that are incrementally updated over a sequence of tasks without forgetting. However, when CL applications are deployed on resource-limited edge devices, learning efficiency can suffer, and this is rarely explored in prior work. This project seeks to build an on-device CL framework that will allow continual on-device learning based on local data without forgetting prior learnt knowledge, while enhancing the efficiency of compute, memory, and data use. Specifically, the project will pursue (1) an efficient on-device CL framework that avoids catastrophic forgetting; and (2) extensions that address practical deployment requirements, including limited training data availability and limited labeling in large datasets. Exploring these two cases enhances the applicability of the proposed approach.<br/><br/>This project promotes personalized, intelligent user experiences powered by AI, while preserving data privacy and adapting to new information in real-time.

However, programming is cognitively demanding and hard to learn. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated a great potential to address this challenge by generating complex programs from natural language, eliminating the need to memorize and grapple with program syntax and semantics. Despite this breakthrough, as a statistical method, LLMs suffer from a number of issues when applied to domains like program generation that emphasize functional correctness, safety, and robustness. For instance, recent studies have shown that LLMs may generate code that does not align with user intent, has security vulnerabilities, or violates coding standards. These issues consequently diminish programmer productivity and trust in LLMs. This project will advance the understanding of the limitations of LLMs in program generation and develop principled regulation approaches to enhance the correctness, safety, and robustness of LLM-generated code. The research findings and education activities of this project will inform the design of new instructional materials and pedagogical approaches to prepare computer science students for future careers in the age of large language models.<br/><br/>This project follows a mixed-methods research design that combines empirical data-driven studies, algorithm development, and tool building. While there have been many recent efforts in evaluating and improving LLM-based program generation, it remains unclear what types of program generation errors LLMs make, whether different kinds of LLMs make different types of errors, and why they make such errors. This project will bridge the knowledge gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of the symptoms and characteristics of program generation errors made by various LLMs using grounded theory and developing root cause analysis methods to investigate the correlation between program errors and the internal states of LLMs. In addition, the project will develop new error localization and mitigation methods that leverage the internal states of LLMs to precisely target the root causes of different kinds of errors at a low cost. The project will also make the first attempt to mitigate non-functional concerns in LLM-generated code by developing new lightweight model adaptation methods. With these advancements, this project aims to fundamentally chang the way LLMs are trained and updated for safe and reliable code generation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to investigate mechanistic and practical aspects of new glycosylation reactions discovered by the Demchenko group, thereby broadening their utility. The overall goal of this project is the invention of efficient approaches for the formation of critical glycosidic bonds in a highly selective manner. The project lies at the interface of organic, carbohydrate, and mechanistic chemistry. The development of such highly selective chemical reactions would provide access to structurally defined glycans for fundamental studies in chemical biology as well as for potential applications in developing diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Integral to the success of this program is the active participation of students of all levels including middle school researchers, who will receive solid training in research methods. This research program will provide opportunities for trainees to engage, learn, and grow through interactions with people from different backgrounds and education levels. <br/><br/>The proposed study will investigate mechanistic and practical aspects of two new chemical reactions discovered by the Demchenko group during previous funding periods, Cooperatively catalyzed Koenigs-Knorr (4K) reaction and H-bond-mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD) reaction.  Under the scope of Objective A, the 4K reaction is to be improved and streamlined to yield a universal method for the direct activation of thioglycosides and other stable glycosyl donors under cooperative catalysis. Under the scope of Objective B, the 4K reaction and the HAD reaction will be combined into one universal ?4K-HAD? platform in an effort to develop a superior method for stereoselective glycosylation.

Those pigments are the well-known chlorophylls that give plants their characteristic green color, and the lesser-known bacteriochlorophylls of selected bacteria. The studies will develop methods for creating Nature?s molecules for photosynthesis.  The reason for carrying out this work is that the ability to create these molecules, and variants thereof, will allow examination of deep questions concerning their basic chemistry and to probe aspects of the conversion of light into chemical energy. The broader impacts of the proposed activity will include the professional development of high school science teachers to improve teaching of photosynthesis (via a chlorophyll-based experiment) in schools and to inspire high school students to STEM, and the expanded deployment to middle schools of a previously developed chlorophyll experiment.<br/><br/>The lack of synthetic methods for preparing (bacterio)chlorophylls and analogues constitutes an intellectual and technical deficit in the photosynthetic sciences. The Lindsey lab aims to fill this gap by developing robust methods for synthesis of such valuable macrocycles. A casual observer may consider the synthesis of chlorophyll to be a finished story ? and this couldn't be more wrong.  In fact, no small-molecule synthetic starting material has ever been converted to a chlorophyll by chemical synthesis, and there are no reports of any attempts to synthesize bacteriochlorophylls.  The proposed work will build on the first example of the total synthesis of a photosynthetic tetrapyrrole, wherein the requisite stereochemical features are installed with simple early precursors via established asymmetric methods.  Objectives to be met are to further streamline a recently developed synthetic route; explore a step-down dehydrogenation approach that provides access from bacteriochlorins to chlorins and porphyrins; examine late-stage derivatization approaches to install critical peripheral functional groups; and in so doing demonstrate access to a handful of representative members of photosynthetic tetrapyrroles.

Software is utilized across the entirety of the workforce and the demand for qualified developers is constantly rising. This poses a significant opportunity to improve recruitment of Hispanic students and women with interests in software careers, as these groups have historically been underrepresented in the computing workforce. Further, software development students often need to complete additional online training to obtain employment, which can represent a challenge to low-income students, working individuals, and others. This project at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC), an open-access HSI, will address the need for a larger and more diverse technical workforce and provide rigorous training through high-quality mentorship, long-term collaborations with nonprofit organizations, and paid project-based internships. The anticipated outcomes of this project are: (a) increased pre- and post-graduation success and improved representation of low-income and underrepresented students in the software workforce; (b) new knowledge about effective approaches for training students on real-world software projects with real clients; and (c) improved efficiency of local nonprofit organizations that serve diverse communities.<br/><br/>The project will explore best practices for internship programs that combine specialized training, mentoring, and implementation at community nonprofits. Providing engaging pathways to broaden participation in software careers is critical as the need for well-prepared software professionals continues to grow. As a Hispanic-Serving Institution, GGC provides an ideal campus to help increase post-graduation success of Hispanic students, low-income students, and others. The project aims to achieve this by (1) offering internship positions, training, and mentoring to software development students, allowing them to gain marketable skills as they engage in authentic, high-impact projects for nonprofit organizations; (2) fostering a software development community at GGC that includes alumni and industry partners and provides ongoing professional development; (3) develop strategies to recruit, engage, and support Hispanic women in software development experiences, courses, and degree programs; (4) creating sustainable collaborations with nonprofit organizations in local Hispanic communities; and (5) disseminating program outcomes nationally through a web gateway, open educational materials, conference presentations, and publications.

Interactions of strings, paths, and loops are ubiquitous throughout mathematics and science. These range from observable phenomena in fluid dynamics (vortex rings in a fluid coming together to become a new ring or self-intersecting and breaking apart into multiple rings) to patterns arising in areas of theoretical physics such as string theory and quantum field theory. String topology proposes a mathematical model to study these interactions in terms of operations defined by intersecting, reconnecting, and cutting strings (closed curves) evolving in time in a manifold. Giving a rigorous and complete description of the structure of string topology, which is one of the aims of the proposed project, will also provide solid foundations for physical theories. Furthermore, the physicially inspired theory of string topology turns out to inform theoretical questions in mathematics: probing a space through strings and studying how all possible interactions are organized also reveals intricate aspects of the background geometry. Building upon previous work of the PI, the project proposes to algebraicize string topology through tractable models obtained by decomposing, or discretizing, the underlying space into cells and using techniques from algebraic topology and homological algebra, two well developed active fields of pure mathematics. These models will be applicable to study a wide range of string interaction phenomena appearing in both pure and applied mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The proposed project includes a broad educational component focused on fostering mathematical activity and access at multiple levels. This involves graduate student training, organization of summer workshops and conferences that bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, and the support of periodic seminars at the PI?s institution. <br/><br/>In more technical detail, this project aims to study chain-level string topology with a focus on operations that are sensitive to geometric structure beyond the homotopy type of the underlying manifold. In particular, the PI proposes to construct a homotopy coherent structure lifting the Goresky-Hingston loop coalgebra (and its S^1-symmetric Lie cobracket version) originally defined on the homology of the space of free loops on a manifold relative to the constant loops. The construction of such structure will use an appropriate refinement of Poincaré duality and intersection theory at the level of chains on a finely triangulated manifold together with the theory of algebraic models for loop spaces of non-simply connected manifolds developed in previous work of the PI using techniques from Hochschild homology theory and Koszul duality theory. These models will be transparent enough to reveal the precise geometric ingredients that are necessary to construct a coherent hierarchy of higher structures for string topology. This hierarchy of chain-level operations will provide a rich source of computable and potentially new manifold invariants. Connections with symplectic geometry, homological mirror symmetry, and the theory of quantization will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen peroxide is an important product for numerous applications including clean water and as an efficient oxidant in chemicals manufacturing. However, it is currently produced at industrial scale via an indirect process that involves reactions of organic chemicals and requires large scales to be economical. For distributed manufacturing, it is desirable to develop a ?greener? process that directly reacts hydrogen with oxygen. However, new catalysts are needed to accelerate the rate of hydrogen peroxide synthesis and avoid side reactions that lead to complete hydrogen oxidation to water. Recent work has suggested that the application of certain organic coatings to common supported metal catalysts can improve hydrogen peroxide synthesis yields, however the way these improve performance is not understood.  Professors Nikolla and Medlin and their teams will systematically vary the properties of the organic-metal interface to identify molecular features associated with high hydrogen peroxide yields. They will also conduct reaction kinetic studies to understand how interactions between the reactants and organic coatings specifically lead to enhanced rates. The research will be carried out by a multi-institutional team that includes collaboration with international and national laboratory partners. The educational component of the project will include training and exchange programs for graduate and undergraduate students and development of new online educational tools related to the research problem.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professors Eranda Nikolla of the University of Michigan and Will Medlin of the University of Colorado Boulder are studying how the near-surface environment influences direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis on supported metal catalysts. Organic ligands are widely used in the synthesis of metal nanocrystals that can be employed as well-defined catalysts. While in many cases it is desirable to remove the ligands, in other instances the retention of ligands can lead to desirable catalyst performance. One important example in which ligand effects have been found to yield major selectivity improvements is the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd catalysts. While there have been some indications that the ligands function via (i) blocking of contiguous surface sites responsible for O2 activation and (ii) promotion of proton shuttling to adsorbed O2, the elementary-step mechanisms by which the coatings enhance selectivity in H2O2 direct synthesis are poorly understood. To develop structure-reactivity relations for hydrogen peroxide synthesis, Professors Nikolla and Medlin will systematically vary (a) the structure and density of ligands, (b) the metal nanoparticle size, shape, and composition, and (c) the solvent properties. The prepared materials will be characterized in depth and utilized in kinetic studies to understand the origins of selective catalysis. The project will involve collaborative efforts in nanoparticle synthesis, characterization of ligand-protected catalysts, reaction kinetic studies, and computational studies of chemistry at organic-modified metal surfaces. Although the project will emphasize the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the principles developed here can be extrapolated to diverse catalytic reactions, particularly since the elementary steps in direct synthesis and its undesired side reactions are broadly important in many chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How individuals perceive social touch depends on many factors, including their reproductive state. One important example of this influence of reproductive state is that postpartum mothers find touch cues from infants extremely positive, which is essential for highly sensitive maternal caregiving and offspring development. There is very little scientific knowledge about how the maternal brain changes across pregnancy and early postpartum to promote the positive perception of infant touch. This project will study how specific areas of the cerebral cortex that receive touch-related information become more sensitive to infant touch cues as pregnancy progresses and as mothers gain early caregiving experience. This project will also broaden educational opportunities and scientific outreach through new student education courses, new research experiences for students, public zoo and museum exhibits, and by mentoring the next generation of brain scientists.<br/> <br/>The experiments in this project will investigate the neural basis of maternal positive receptivity to offspring touch, with a focus on the role of cortical perineuronal nets (PNNs). Female reproduction and the onset of motherhood involve widespread neuroplasticity that underlies this critical social interaction. Importantly, this neuroplasticity occurs in cortical sites involved in processing touch, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1; mediates tactile discrimination) and the insular cortex (IC; processes affective components of touch). Cortical plasticity is regulated by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures surrounding the somata and proximal dendrites of parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons. PNNs are physical and molecular barriers to synaptic plasticity and expression of these ?master regulators? of plasticity changes across times of significant sensory and behavioral flux. Recent experiments reported impaired maternal behavior associated with PNN overexpression in the rat S1 facial microvibrissae area. The current project tests the overarching hypothesis that female reproduction involves changes in PNN expression in S1 and IC, and that these changes alter cortical function critical for tactile regulation of maternal caregiving. This hypothesis will be tested in female rats by: (1) using histochemistry and rt-qPCR to determine changes in PNNs and associated mRNAs in S1 and IC across natural female reproduction, in response to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking pregnancy, and in response to repeated pup exposure and (2) using viral and chemical strategies to determine the effects of PNN underexpression or overexpression in the S1 or IC on maternal caregiving behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recognizing the significant shortages in both the STEM and rural teaching workforces, the project aims to ensure the availability of a robust rural STEM teaching workforce through continuous innovation. STEM teaching workforce shortages arise from the low numbers of enrollments in initial licensure programs in mathematics, physical science, and life science licensure areas compounded by strong employment prospects and comparatively high initial salaries for STEM graduates in most fields. Rural districts also face additional hurdles in hiring highly-qualified STEM teachers due to limited local populations, constrained budgets, and difficulties in recruiting experienced teachers. The project seeks to counter these shortages by supporting the recruitment, education, and retention of promising rural STEM teacher candidates. Specifically, the project will explore the circumstances under which rural STEM students would pursue teacher licensure and when those initially seeking licensure in non-STEM areas would switch to a STEM pathway. With this understanding, new licensure pathways will be designed to attract and retain highly qualified rural STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project at the University of Maine includes partnerships with rural school districts and communities. Key objectives include: 1) developing a survey to examine undergraduate motivations for choosing STEM or teacher education; 2) organizing design thinking workshops with partners to create rural-focused licensure pathways; and 3) conducting market research with rural STEM and teacher education majors to determine the best strategies for licensure of rural STEM teacher candidates. The project builds on University of Maine research demonstrating that non-rural teacher education majors rarely consider rural communities for future careers. This finding means that rural STEM students represent the best possible source of future rural STEM teachers. This project has the potential to develop scalable, replicable pathways to move more rural students into STEM licensure pathways. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

In this context, in-storage indexing devices (ISIDs) have emerged to enhance the functionalities of storage devices, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and cost-effective data processing. By storing index information alongside the data it indexes within the same storage device, ISIDs offer several advantages over traditional indexing methods. These advantages include reducing data movement, improving access speed, minimizing network impact, enabling efficient data management, and freeing host computing for critical tasks. To design efficient ISIDs, several challenges need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a need for low-cost and open-source research platforms to facilitate the reproduction and comparison of research work, promoting quick adoption of ISID advancements. Secondly, integrating the fragmented advancements of individual ISID components is crucial to capture their holistic impacts and interactions effectively. Thirdly, addressing diverse workload requests, interference in multi-tenant environments, and data distribution considerations requires new research methods for overall operation optimization. This CAREER research project aims to overcome these research challenges and promote the adoption of ISIDs, contributing to the advancements of storage systems. This project will explore and develop innovative methods to unleash the full potential of ISIDs in modern data management systems. By addressing the core challenges, the project seeks to revolutionize data storage systems and make significant contributions to the field of storage technology. This project will share the findings with undergraduate and graduate students through computer science programs and open up career opportunities to female students, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students. This project will disseminate the proposed techniques into the industry and foster technology transfer through new industrial collaborations. The developed infrastructure will be available to the research community through a web-based portal.<br/><br/>This research makes significant empirical contributions to the ISID design and development space by addressing major challenges posed by in-storage indexing. Specifically, it advances the state of knowledge by investigating the following questions: (1) How can we design and develop new ISID models that accurately capture the behavior of internal modules, such as the index manager, request handler, data access parallelism, index-induced wear leveling, and garbage collection? These insights will enable scientific design advancements and detailed tradeoff analysis for ISIDs. (2) How can we develop efficient dynamic model calibration techniques using coarse measurements to parameterize queuing models that accurately capture burstiness and variability in ISIDs? (3) How can we emulate index manager delays using different data structures and sizes and utilize black-box and gray-box calibration techniques to identify ground truth for ISIDs? (4) How can we design a new re-configurable indexing architecture and index cache that ensures deterministic tail latency, low overhead prefetching and eviction, and improved membership checking through object signatures and ML-based feature learning in ISIDs? (5) How can we design tenant-local eviction policies that consider the effect of allocating space for index and data, recognizing the dependencies between them for efficient data access in ISIDs? (6) How can we minimize log-checking overhead and avoid in-storage hash computations while exploring the trade-off between consistency and performance by allowing read-only tenants to bypass the log and access their own consistent index in ISIDs? (7) Does capacity variance, which gracefully reduces ISID capacity as flash pages become bad, provide a better alternative to wear-leveling for ISIDs? Throughout the project, the PI will facilitate the connection of the proposed research with the contents and concepts of several courses on Systems at FIU.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell migration plays a major role in many settings including cancer metastasis, wound healing, and the immune response. For example, breast cancer cell migration is considered a major risk factor for metastatic bone or lung tumors and fibroblast migration in wound healing has roles in diabetes and necrotizing enterocolitis (life-threatening intestinal wounds that affect 10% of premature babies). This project aims to understand the intrinsic properties of cell migration, i.e., how internal forces of a cell respond to the properties of the surrounding, external environment and drive cell migration. To do this, The PIs will develop a novel mathematical model of a migrating cell. The model combines pre-existing knowledge of cell migration and cell properties with an imaging method that can measure subcellular forces. The model will yield force information throughout the cell, not just at the measurement locations. Accompanying that model with appropriate statistical analysis will help identify how the external environment can effect migration via internal subcellular force generation. This, in turn, will help us better understand how to inhibit (e.g. cancer) or promote (e.g. wound healing) cell migration in order to improve patient outcomes. The project will mentor and train graduates from multiple disciplines, undergraduates from institutions lacking research opportunities through Indiana University Indianapolis?s NSF-DMS REU program, and socioeconomically disadvantaged high schoolers through the American Chemical Society Project SEED/STEM. Plans include outreach via presentations and minisymposia at several conferences, open-access publications, YouTube postings, in-class modules, local community presentations (Science on Tap), and the STEM Youth Enrichment Summer program for underrepresented high schoolers. <br/><br/>Cell migration is driven by its intracellular forces but is mainly directed by extracellular properties and perturbations. To understand how extracellular properties determine internal forces to direct cell migration, the PIs plan to accomplish three specific aims: 1) Develop a model that integrates experimentally measured intracellular tensions and uses them to establish a force architecture throughout the cell, 2) Use that model and the experimental measurements to identify which subcellular components play major roles in cell migration, and 3) Use modeling and experiments to understand the response of internal forces and migration of the cell to the external properties. Through this approach the PIs will be able to identify several primary pathways (external properties to subcellular components to directed motion) by which external properties use subcellular forces to direct migration. In the model, the cell will be represented by a set of interconnected viscoelastic springs modeling the membrane and other subcellular components. The flow will be modeled using a novel lattice-Boltzmann approach for steady-state Stokes flow. Fluid-structure interaction will be modeled using the immersed boundary method. The model will be calibrated and validated using the experiments. The internal tension experiments will use imaging methods and various molecular tension sensors to capture the force landscape within a cell, particularly at focal adhesions, cytoskeletal junctures, and the nuclear envelope. The external environmental alteration will include the extracellular matrix stiffness, chemotactic gradient, and flow properties. Correlation, sensitivity, and principal component analyses will be used to identify potential migratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will also pursue educational initiatives aimed at fostering greater involvement in scientific research for students from underrepresented backgrounds. These initiatives encompass a variety of activities, including the Seed Experience in Authentic Research for First-Years (SEARF) workshop, which offers first-year chemistry students at Oberlin a straightforward entry point into authentic research. Collaborative development of open-source pedagogical modules will address challenges associated with teaching transition-metal mechanisms in undergraduate classrooms. To further promote equitable access to scientific research, the project will also provide financial support for undergraduate students to perform research throughout the academic year and to high school students during the summer months. <br/><br/>While mechanistic insight derived from computations is increasingly used to inform the development of new synthetic methodologies, many important transition-metal-catalyzed systems remain challenging for computationally-guided reaction design.

Building on preliminary results that revealed multiple types of unexpected coordination-sphere effects in C?H, C?C and C=C functionalization systems, Dr. Chen and her research group plan to carry out computational studies that will shed light on the interactions between coordination-sphere elements. They aim to elucidate the power structure of coordination-sphere effects, including the primary (core ligand moieties), secondary (pendant ligand moieties), and tertiary (solvent shell) coordination spheres, in key mechanistic steps that often constitute the energetic bottlenecks of synthetically useful chemical transformations.

As BCI create intricate connections between the nervous system and technology by measuring biological signals from individuals and translating them into commands for devices, and they hold great potential for treating neurological disorders. Neural interface technologies have the potential to revolutionize the field of rehabilitation by allowing the nervous system to control novel devices that can offer new hope and possibilities for regaining control and independence despite physical limitations.

Within mathematical logic, three major subfields are studied. Model theory understands mathematical objects by considering them through the lens of a formal language. Computability theory understands mathematical objects by considering them through the lens of computational complexity. Set theory understands mathematical objects through the foundational axioms of mathematics and how those axioms imply the object?s existence. This project focuses on some connections between computability theory and the other two subfields of logic. Regarding model theory, the project involves exploring the phenomenon when two mathematical objects look the same in terms of their formal languages, but one can be computed while the other cannot. In set theory, there is a rich theory exploring the complexity of 2-dimensional sets in terms of constructively embedding one into another. These embeddings are constructible in terms of the basic set-theoretic operations of unions and complements, but they may not be computable. The project will explore an analogous theory where one considers embeddings that must be computable. This project involves work with undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The computable spectrum of a first-order theory asks which dimensions of models of that theory are computable. The spectrum problem in computable model theory, which has been a major open problem since the 70s, asks for which sets may be computable spectra of uncountably categorical theories, with a focus on strongly minimal theories. In this project,  the aim is to give a reduction of the problem from a fully general framework down to the locally modular strongly minimal theories, which are geometrically tame and are closely related to groups. From there, the hope is to be able to give concrete answers as to which sets are spectra. Separately, this project will examine computable reduction on equivalence relations. One major direction is to use this complexity notion to examine algebraic decision problems in detail. In the past, the Turing degrees have been used to analyze algebraic decision problems, but these form a coarse yardstick, so all computably enumerable degrees seem to contain all natural algebraic decision problems. Using computable reductions on equivalence relations, there should be a much more interesting structure emerging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These adversaries employ crafted inputs to exploit undisclosed or unpatched security flaws (bugs) in protocol implementations. Despite the common strategy of bug identification and patching, unearthing elusive bugs in protocol implementations remains challenging as it requires navigating stringent input validation to discover bugs that lurk deep in the code. Fuzzing, endorsed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), automates security testing by passing abnormal inputs to programs in order to discover bugs. While fuzzing has effectively uncovered bugs in many real-world systems, it still struggles to generate semantically correct inputs essential for testing beyond initial input validation. This project bridges this gap in traditional fuzzing by developing an innovative automated solution that effectively enhances the testing of protocol implementations. <br/><br/>The core objective of this project is to develop an automated, context-sensitive fuzzing approach that effectively uncovers bugs in security-critical protocol implementations. This project realizes its objective through activities across three complementary research thrusts. The first thrust designs a domain specific language to encode context-sensitive hierarchical structures of inputs and develops algorithms to efficiently generate semantically correct inputs. The second thrust devises several mutation techniques, essential for fuzzing, that will maintain the context-sensitivity of the input. The third thrust develops mechanisms to faithfully maintain the internal state of a stateful protocol so that each fuzz input can be tested in a suitable state of the protocol.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of protocol implementations, benefiting society.

In this way, combinatorics provides a set of basic tools and a collection of argument prototypes that guide the solution of problems throughout STEM.

The electrical force comes from the rearrangement of charged atoms called ions, like the sodium and chloride of table salt.  The heat energy that was used to cause this rearrangement can be recovered as more useful electrical energy.  For example, this energy could be used to recharge a battery.  This is a desirable way to utilize energy because the heat is often inexpensive or even free, such as from the sun or from the heat produced from applying brakes to a vehicle.  The project will provide training for students at undergraduate, masters, and doctoral levels, including from the historically African-American Coppin State and Morgan State Universities, in making polymers and studying their electronic properties.  Furthermore, these students will be trained in computer modeling and artificial intelligence-guided materials design.  <br/><br/>The ionic Seebeck effect in polymers, which produces a voltage from a difference in temperature, is an attractive means of harvesting electrical energy because the heat source is often free or might otherwise be wasted. It is driven by differences in the most stable arrangements of different charged species, creating an imbalance of charge in regions that differ in temperature.  The chemical basis for this effect has had only limited prior analysis.  The objectives of this proposal are to synthesize a rational set of cationic polymers with mobile counterions of varied size from which structure-activity relationships will be obtained governing the anionic Seebeck coefficient, and to perform experimental and computational tests of these materials to produce the necessary thermoelectric data and structural/electronic models, respectively.  This study aims to derive and develop the first mechanistic explanation of the origin of Seebeck coefficients based on the redistribution of anions in media where anions are the principal mobile charge carriers, with the goal of developing more efficient conversion of heat to stored electrical energy. If successful, these studies have the potential for broad scientific impact in the areas of energy science, electrochemistry and sustainable chemistry solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Corrosion of steel continues to be a limiting factor in the durability of reinforced concrete and has prevented the use of novel and otherwise durable carbon-dioxide consuming cement and concrete. This project will identify optimal steel and concrete interface conditions that can perpetually limit chloride influenced corrosion damage considering both traditional and sustainable alternative concrete mixture formulations. The research effort will be integrated with an education goal to improve the ability of civil engineering students and practitioners to address often overlooked corrosion durability issues in civil infrastructure. Research experiences for high school students will be used to enhance interests in STEM careers among underrepresented groups. Corrosion damage forecasting modules disseminated and administered through an internationally recognized corrosion organization will provide a knowledge foundation and skill set to civil engineering practitioners tasked with ensuring the durability of civil infrastructure.<br/><br/>The research objective is to characterize the multi-scale evolution of steel corrosion within concrete considering the condition of the steel and concrete interface. Corrosion starts as small, localized pits that can grow and accumulate into more widespread corrosion damage. However, under some conditions the pits can stop growing by the process of repassivation. The project aims to: 1) identify steel and concrete interface conditions required to promote repassivation of chloride-induced pitting corrosion, 2) establish the mechanisms controlling pit shape evolution and damage progression, and 3) identify optimally corrosion resistant interface conditions based on multi-scale damage forecasting models calibrated to exposure testing results. The ability of the interface condition to promote repassivation of localized pits will be quantified according to pit stability coefficients measured by single pit growth experiments accounting for cathodic limitations due to moisture levels and the porous-reactive nature of binder formulations. Split bipolar electrochemistry coupled with a multi-physics model will yield pit growth kinetics and shape evolution considering the quality of the steel and concrete interface. A multi-scale corrosion damage forecasting model that can simulate the transition of localized pitting corrosion to macro-scaled corrosion damage will be used to inform optimal interface conditions that maximize corrosion durability considering traditional and novel carbon-sequestering concrete formulations. The results of this work will enable the development of performance-based specifications for the design of perpetually limited corrosion of reinforced concrete infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tracking and accounting for protections of data privacy has emerged as a pivotal requirement in contemporary data protection regulations. As a result, those who are responsible for using personal data, so-called data controllers, must actively enhance the privacy safeguards they provide. This project addresses the intricate challenges surrounding privacy accountability within the mobile software ecosystem, characterized by the opacity of third-party code modules, particularly third-party libraries. Existing methods for achieving privacy accountability primarily emphasize data transparency, often overlooking essential principles like data minimization and purpose limitation and facing integration challenges within mobile software development lifecycles. This research project seeks to address these limitations by presenting innovative approaches to enforce privacy accountability throughout the mobile software development process. The goal is to establish a more privacy-conscious and accountable mobile ecosystem, benefiting both users and data controllers. The outcomes of the research will contribute to educational curriculum and training to help developers achieve privacy goals plus additional outreach through workshop and bootcamp venues. <br/><br/>The project's technical objectives are divided into three research thrusts: (1) understanding privacy accountability challenges in the mobile third-party code modules; (2) designing a privacy-accountable disclosure framework; (3) continuously enforcing privacy accountability properties in mobile software development lifecycle. The technical contribution of this research lies in advancing the socio-technical understanding of privacy non-compliance risks and accountability challenges within the mobile software supply chain. Additionally, it involves designing novel technical foundations that seamlessly integrate various methodologies and disciplines. This includes program analysis, formal methods, natural language processing, and human subject research, culminating in a privacy-accountable disclosure framework and continuous privacy accountability enforcement mechanism. These innovations are designed to be easily adoptable within the mobile software supply chain. The research will foster a holistic approach to enhancing privacy protection and accountability in mobile software development lifecycle and contribute to the creation of a safer and more privacy-conscious mobile ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell migration plays a major role in many settings including cancer metastasis, wound healing, and the immune response. For example, breast cancer cell migration is considered a major risk factor for metastatic bone or lung tumors and fibroblast migration in wound healing has roles in diabetes and necrotizing enterocolitis (life-threatening intestinal wounds that affect 10% of premature babies). This project aims to understand the intrinsic properties of cell migration, i.e., how internal forces of a cell respond to the properties of the surrounding, external environment and drive cell migration. To do this, The PIs will develop a novel mathematical model of a migrating cell. The model combines pre-existing knowledge of cell migration and cell properties with an imaging method that can measure subcellular forces. The model will yield force information throughout the cell, not just at the measurement locations. Accompanying that model with appropriate statistical analysis will help identify how the external environment can effect migration via internal subcellular force generation. This, in turn, will help us better understand how to inhibit (e.g. cancer) or promote (e.g. wound healing) cell migration in order to improve patient outcomes. The project will mentor and train graduates from multiple disciplines, undergraduates from institutions lacking research opportunities through Indiana University Indianapolis?s NSF-DMS REU program, and socioeconomically disadvantaged high schoolers through the American Chemical Society Project SEED/STEM. Plans include outreach via presentations and minisymposia at several conferences, open-access publications, YouTube postings, in-class modules, local community presentations (Science on Tap), and the STEM Youth Enrichment Summer program for underrepresented high schoolers. <br/><br/>Cell migration is driven by its intracellular forces but is mainly directed by extracellular properties and perturbations. To understand how extracellular properties determine internal forces to direct cell migration, the PIs plan to accomplish three specific aims: 1) Develop a model that integrates experimentally measured intracellular tensions and uses them to establish a force architecture throughout the cell, 2) Use that model and the experimental measurements to identify which subcellular components play major roles in cell migration, and 3) Use modeling and experiments to understand the response of internal forces and migration of the cell to the external properties. Through this approach the PIs will be able to identify several primary pathways (external properties to subcellular components to directed motion) by which external properties use subcellular forces to direct migration. In the model, the cell will be represented by a set of interconnected viscoelastic springs modeling the membrane and other subcellular components. The flow will be modeled using a novel lattice-Boltzmann approach for steady-state Stokes flow. Fluid-structure interaction will be modeled using the immersed boundary method. The model will be calibrated and validated using the experiments. The internal tension experiments will use imaging methods and various molecular tension sensors to capture the force landscape within a cell, particularly at focal adhesions, cytoskeletal junctures, and the nuclear envelope. The external environmental alteration will include the extracellular matrix stiffness, chemotactic gradient, and flow properties. Correlation, sensitivity, and principal component analyses will be used to identify potential migratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current account security logs offer unreliable and coarse-grained information for users to differentiate their logins from attackers' logins. Limited data, such as device model and approximate city or province based on IP addresses, can be easily spoofed by attackers, especially in cases of interpersonal attacks. Interpersonal attackers know the victims personally; they may be an intimate partner, family member, friend, or colleague. An interpersonal attacker may live in the same house or town and possess devices with identical models as the victim, making it challenging for victims to conclusively detect unauthorized logins by their attackers.  The key problem here is twofold: (a) there is no unique and non-spoofable device identifier that preserves user privacy, and (b) humans and online services identify physical devices differently. In this project, we aim to tackle these issues by developing a framework of device identifiers that can uniquely identify a device while preserving users' privacy and users are able to recognize and associate those ids with their respective physical device, bridging the disconnect between the methods of identifying devices by humans and software.<br/><br/>This project is designing, implementing, and evaluating novel ways to improve account security logs to enhance unauthorized login detection. The objectives of the project are to (a) design and implement a protocol for deriving unique yet privacy preserving identifiers of devices; (b) explore methods to familiarize users with such device identifiers without disrupting their user experience, and (c) redesign account security logs to incorporate such identifiers and measure their efficacy in detecting unauthorized logs. The broader impacts of the project include: (1) producing guidelines and engaging with developers of online services to enhance account security mechanisms, (2) deploying unauthorized login detection with Madison Tech Clinic (MTC) and Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA) in New York City to support survivors of IA, (3) teaching students about nuanced threat models, like those of IA, and (4) increasing the participation of students from minority backgrounds, such as women and LGBTQ+ students, by providing a space to engage and influence technologies with real-world impact on their lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How individuals perceive social touch depends on many factors, including their reproductive state. One important example of this influence of reproductive state is that postpartum mothers find touch cues from infants extremely positive, which is essential for highly sensitive maternal caregiving and offspring development. There is very little scientific knowledge about how the maternal brain changes across pregnancy and early postpartum to promote the positive perception of infant touch. This project will study how specific areas of the cerebral cortex that receive touch-related information become more sensitive to infant touch cues as pregnancy progresses and as mothers gain early caregiving experience. This project will also broaden educational opportunities and scientific outreach through new student education courses, new research experiences for students, public zoo and museum exhibits, and by mentoring the next generation of brain scientists.<br/> <br/>The experiments in this project will investigate the neural basis of maternal positive receptivity to offspring touch, with a focus on the role of cortical perineuronal nets (PNNs). Female reproduction and the onset of motherhood involve widespread neuroplasticity that underlies this critical social interaction. Importantly, this neuroplasticity occurs in cortical sites involved in processing touch, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1; mediates tactile discrimination) and the insular cortex (IC; processes affective components of touch). Cortical plasticity is regulated by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures surrounding the somata and proximal dendrites of parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons. PNNs are physical and molecular barriers to synaptic plasticity and expression of these ?master regulators? of plasticity changes across times of significant sensory and behavioral flux. Recent experiments reported impaired maternal behavior associated with PNN overexpression in the rat S1 facial microvibrissae area. The current project tests the overarching hypothesis that female reproduction involves changes in PNN expression in S1 and IC, and that these changes alter cortical function critical for tactile regulation of maternal caregiving. This hypothesis will be tested in female rats by: (1) using histochemistry and rt-qPCR to determine changes in PNNs and associated mRNAs in S1 and IC across natural female reproduction, in response to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking pregnancy, and in response to repeated pup exposure and (2) using viral and chemical strategies to determine the effects of PNN underexpression or overexpression in the S1 or IC on maternal caregiving behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In photosynthesis, plants use the energy of light to produce sugars: this is a chemical process that ultimately is responsible for sustaining all life on earth. While chemists have also learned how to use light in chemical synthesis, they have developed no synthetic processes that can achieve the same level of structural complexity and atomic precision as natural photosynthesis. To approach this grand challenge, the Yoon laboratory is designing photocatalysts that can interact directly with small molecules and control how they react to form more complex products. Because this work has the potential to transform discovery in pharmaceutical and materials chemistry, the technical skill sets required to complete this research are in high demand. Thus, one broader impact of this research is the training of a diverse team of young chemists for careers at the cutting edge of the chemical industries. The Yoon group is also leveraging social media tools to present topics in contemporary chemistry to a global community of novice science students who might not otherwise have any exposure to these ideas.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Tehshik Yoon and his team will design novel photocatalysts take advantage of recent discoveries in solar energy conversion. The team will modify the structures of the most robust and active molecular photocatalysts by introducing polar functional groups that can bind to simple organic substrates through hydrogen-bonding or Lewis acid-base interactions.  This enforced proximity is expected to increase the efficiency by which the photocatalyst can influence a chemical reaction. It also provides an opportunity to tune the structure of the photocatalyst to modify the outcomes of the photochemical reaction. Yoon and his team will take an interdisciplinary approach to this research that combines chemical synthesis with computation and spectroscopy to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions. Thus, the outcomes of this research will include both new methods for the synthesis of complex molecular compounds but also fundamental insights into the ways in which light energy can be used in chemical synthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent innovations in financial technology (fintech) have dramatically reshaped the consumer loan market, including the rise of ?fringetech??digital financial technologies designed to compete with traditional AFS. Yet, we know little about the potentially significant economic and policy consequences of fringetech use for households who are struggling financially?especially low-wage workers who are relying on fringetech in growing numbers.

Findings will be disseminated to help inform emerging debates at the federal and state level about how best to regulate these new financial technologies. The project will also help train a diverse cohort of future scholars and practitioners in finance and fintech research. <br/><br/>This CAREER research and teaching grant will achieve the following objectives: 1) analyze original, large-n survey data to systematically describe when and how different cohorts use fringetech to navigate liquidity problems; 2) utilize original qualitative borrower interviews and a dataset on state welfare, financial protection, and wage laws to analyze how state subsystems shape fringetech use for different cohorts; 3) analyze whether and how people?s fringetech use influences their preferences for economic rules and their public participation; 4) establish a topical lab and course, based on principles of inclusive pedagogy, to promote interest in and research concerning fringetech from students historically underrepresented in those fields; and 5) produce and disseminate research to inform emerging federal and state fringetech regulation, and create publicly available scorecards to help people track fringetech consumer protection in their state.

Though the microservices architecture has many advantages, it has one critical drawback.  Observing how user requests (e.g., to buy a book) are processed by services is extremely challenging because they involve myriad interactions among many simpler (micro)services.  This lack of observability complicates important management tasks, such as problem diagnosis and resource management.  Previous research has demonstrated the strong potential of distributed tracing---which captures graphs of how microservices interact to process requests---to provide microservice observability.  But, results in real-world settings have been disappointing.  This gap between potential and reality occurs because research efforts assume principled trace graphs that capture a variety of behaviors and have no data loss.  But, in practice, services are never well-instrumented and data loss is common.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to create a new tracing platform that automatically infers the data needed to make traces principled. Doing so will actualize distributed tracings' vast potential for microservice observability, improve the utility of existing tracing-based management tools, and enable transformative new tools. These outcomes will improve the resiliency and efficiency of the software services society depends on.  Insights from this project will inform age-appropriate course material and projects in a college course on debugging cloud systems, a high-school research program, and a middle-school outreach program.<br/><br/>This project proposes a novel tracing platform that automatically enriches span-based traces with two sets of primitives.  1) The happens-before concurrency/wait primitives and 2) the holes and holes covering primitives.  The former allows requests' critical paths to be identified, enabling slack analyses, targeted performance debugging, and precise resource allocation decisions.  The latter allows areas of data loss to be expressed in traces along with predictions of what work might execute in them.  Since scheduling decisions may obfuscate causal structure, the project will investigate active probing methods to tease out concurrent and waiting relationships.  To account for uncertainty, it will explore probabilistic data models to represent the primitives.  The project will demonstrate the value of the primitives by modifying an existing auto-scaling solution and performance-debugging tool to use them.  It will also demonstrate a new trace subgraph sampling approach made possible by the holes and holes covering primitive.  The proposed platform, improved management tools, and inference methods will be publicly available to benefit the computer science and microservice observability communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical model theory focuses on studying classes of structures that can be defined by sets of finite sentences (first-order logic). Although many classes are defined by sets of finite sentences, there are many that can only be defined using sets of infinite sentences (infinitary logic). The setting of this project is that of abstract elementary classes (AECs for short) which is a setting where one can study classes defined by sets of infinite sentences. AECs have been studied since the late seventies, and recently, the theory has developed very rapidly. The objective of this project is to continue the PI's work on finding interactions and applications of AECs to algebra. <br/><br/>More precisely, the project focuses on finding interactions and applications of AECs to module theory and acts (polygons, G-sets) theory. The first part of the project focuses on continuing the development of AECs of modules. A key problem is to determine the stability behavior of AECs of modules with pure embeddings. The second part of the project focuses on developing a parallel theory for acts to what the PI has been able to accomplish for modules.   A fundamental notion that will be studied on AECs of acts is independence relations (non-forking for AECs). The PI expects that these studies will help him better understand the strengths and limitations of independence relations, so he can apply them in other settings in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first is precisely and formally capturing the requirements of programs and program components: one does not want a program to rely on comparing functions for equality or adding arbitrary integers to pointers.  The second is modular and extensible program construction: program components must be developed independently and changes internal to one component should not cause cascading changes to other components.  This project's novelties are: a new foundation for extensible descriptions of program properties and invariants, subsuming multiple competing and complementary features used in current languages; its implementation; and its metatheory.  The project's impacts are: regularizing and extending features for specifying program properties in existing languages; simplifying their implementation; and making these features practical for adoption in other languages.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this project is the programming language Haskell.  Haskell has an advanced type system with several features for modular and extensible specification of program properties, most prominently type classes and type families.  These features have evolved mostly independently, with different approaches to their specification and implementation.  The result, for both programmers and implementers, is a constellation of features with frequently surprising interactions and limitations.  This project develops a new core language for Haskell, with a single feature that captures both type classes and type families.  It will simplify Haskell implementations and make the existing features of Haskell more regular and more expressive.  It will enable new features of Haskell, closing the gaps between type families and type classes.  And, it will make it easier for other languages to adopt features from Haskell, by giving them a simpler underlying semantics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They may be used, for example, to study the evolution of a gas or a plasma. The Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in the study of the Boltzmann and Landau equations, for systems of particles that repel each other by power-law potentials. These equations exhibit a regularization effect. An outstanding open problem is to understand if a singularity could emerge from the natural flow of the equation, or if the regularization effects actually dominate the evolution and keep the solutions smooth. The PI mentors graduate students and postdocs in research on the topics of this project.<br/><br/>This project aims at developing tools in the analysis of nonlocal equations, parabolic equations and hypoelliptic theory targeted to their applications in kinetic equations. The Boltzmann collision operator acts as a nonlinear diffusive operator of fractional order. It can be studied in the framework of parabolic integro-differential equations. The Landau equation is a model from statistical mechanics used to describe the dynamics of plasma. It can be obtained as a limit case of the Boltzmann equation when grazing collisions prevail. It is a second order, nonlinear, parabolic equation. The project connects different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, relating recent progress in nonlinear integro-differential equations with the classical Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics. Kinetic equations involve a nonlinear diffusive operator with respect to velocity, combined with a transport equation with respect to space. The regularization effect in all variables requires ideas from hypoelliptic theory. For the Boltzmann equation in the case of very soft potentials, as well as for the Landau equation with Coulomb potentials, the diffusive part of the equations is not strong enough to prevent the solution from blowing up in theory. In that case, new ideas are needed to properly understand the regularization effects of the equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In classical mechanics it is possible to simultaneously observe and measure various properties of a physical system ? for example, the locations and velocities of all of its components. Such properties are often called observables.  Observables be viewed as functions of the underlying system and form an algebra ? they can be added and multiplied.   In quantum mechanics, simultaneous measurements are no longer possible. Mathematically this is reflected by the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables for quantum systems. Nonetheless, many of the operations that can be done with ordinary functions have quantum analogs.  The current proposal studies such non-commutative algebras of observables from the angle of Voiculescu?s free probability theory, which treats observables as random variables. This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations and Brownian motion, amenable to analysis by techniques inspired by classical information theory.  This project will promote human resource development through graduate and undergraduate research opportunities and will support students under the auspices of the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle.  <br/><br/>The proposed research deals with several questions in von Neumann algebras which are approached by free probability and free information methods, including free entropy theory.  This includes further developing PDE based methods in the non-commutative context and strengthening the connection between free probability and random matrix theory.  Among the research directions is a notion of dimension that is based on the behavior of optimal transportation distance, as well as applications of free information theory techniques to von Neumann algebra theory.

Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.  With the completion of the human genome project, more and more SNPs have been identified as biomarkers for life-threatening diseases. Detecting such SNPs is of particular importance to the fields of cancer diagnosis, pathogen detection, and various health condition monitoring. The standard methods to detect SNPs rely on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), but are largely limited by their poor sensitivity and bad accuracy. This CAREER project will exploit the newly discovered CRISPR technology to detect disease-related SNPs, improving human health. To provide broader impacts on a national level, this project will pursue the following two education and outreach goals: 1) broaden participation in careers in biotechnology and 2) equip undergraduate and graduate students with the required biotechnology knowledge and hands-on experience. <br/><br/>In bacteria and archaea cells, CRISPR was developed as an adaptive defense system against viral infections. In addition to gene editing, CRISPR technology has been applied to detect nucleic acids in the past few years. This NSF CAREER project aims to study the fundamental properties of CRISPR Cas nucleases through their non-specific collateral activities (also named ?trans-cleavage? activity) and apply the knowledge to detect disease-related SNPs. The central hypothesis is that systematic characterization and optimization of the trans-cleavage activities of the CRISPR Cas nucleases (Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14) will provide a solid foundation to develop novel biosensing approaches for the ultra-accurate detection of disease-related SNPs (less than 0.1% SNPs in wild type can be detected). The major research objectives are: 1) enable an ultra-accurate detection of SNPs using a CRISPR-Cas14 biosensor; 2) design a ratiometric detection of SNPs using biorthogonal CRISPR-Cas13 systems; and 3) demonstrate CRISPR-12 array sensors to identify multiple SNPs simultaneously.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, predicting humans' actions and reactions to operate can be challenging for the robot, while direct control of the robot by humans may, in turn, require an intuitive understanding of the robot's movements, increasing the workload for the user. The research team will explore the potential of shared control, which can help soft robots benefit from human insights into environmental interactions, while also reducing the burden on the human user. The findings of this research will be instrumental in advancing the integration of soft robots into a range of human environments, from personal to industrial, and could lead to new emergent behaviors that improve our autonomous control of these robots.

These nanoparticles strongly absorb sunlight. It was recently shown that they can photolytically drive chemical transformations when illuminated with sunlight through a process known as plasmonic catalysis. The interest in the field is rooted in the fact that, in contrast to conventional thermally driven chemical reactions on metals, photoreactions on these nanoparticles present the possibility of providing higher efficiencies and product selectivity. Specifically, the Linic group is studying the hypothesis that the plasmonic catalysis of these nanoparticles can be optimized for high rates and selectivities through specific design of their surface composition and structure. The proposal promises to advance our understanding of using solar energy to drive chemistry in an environmentally sustainable and energy efficient manner.  Professor Linic and his students will be involved in educational activities, such as development of a sustainable energy course, and multiple outreach efforts directed at underrepresented students in science.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Suljo Linic and his team at the University of Michigan are studying chemical reactions on plasmonic metal nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are characterized by a resonant excitation of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) when illuminated with solar intensity UV-vis light. It has been demonstrated that under the LSPR conditions, these nanoparticles can activate hot electron (hole)-driven chemical reactions at meaningful rates, and in contrast to conventional thermally driven chemical reactions on metals, where energy is indiscriminately dumped into every available reaction coordinate (and controlling product selectivity is challenging), the LSPR-driven reactions offer the opportunity to efficiently deposit energy into select reaction coordinates leading to high efficiencies and product selectivity. The central hypothesis of the project is that optimal plasmonic materials, allowing for higher reaction rates and product selectivity, are plasmonic single atom alloy (SAA) nanoparticles with a relatively large plasmonic (Ag or Au) nanoparticle (10s of nm), augmented with isolated single atoms of other metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru) in the surface layer of the plasmonic nanoparticle. The SAAs are potentially an optimal marriage of the light harvesting potential of plasmonic nanoparticles and the chemical activity of the single atoms. It is postulated that these structures would allow us to control the resonant energy flow at the nanoscale, funneling energy efficiently and selectively in specific and desired chemical transformations. The proposal will test this hypothesis by: (i) synthesizing plasmonic SAA and characterizing their geometry, (ii) studying the flow of optical energy in these materials at nanoscales and (ii) testing these plasmonic SAA nanostructures in a number of steady state catalytic processes where the product selectivity is of critical importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When this stretching reaches a critical level, the magnetic field lines reconnect, rapidly releasing the stored energy while powering important space weather effects, such as magnetospheric substorms, that can be hazardous to satellites and the power grid on Earth.  Understanding the physics describing the stretched magnetotail and reconnection onset is crucial to modeling and predicting space weather phenomena.  Reconnection onset requires the magnetotail current sheet (CS) to thin down to the scales of the plasma particles, such as protons or even electrons orbits, which are nearly microscopic compared to the vast expanse of the magnetotail.  This project aims to investigate the structure, stability, and reconnection regimes of these overstretched CSs to understand the mechanism of reconnection onset in the magnetotail and explain its observed location far outside the near-Earth region.  The data-mining component of the research will contribute to the relatively under-investigated area of machine learning dealing with little and sparse rather than big data.  The broader impacts of this project include hands-on research training for a graduate student, the career development of early career scientists, and interdisciplinary applications to the methodology developed.<br/><br/>The onset of reconnection in the magnetotail requires its current sheet (CS) to thin down to the thermal ion gyroradius (or thinner) to demagnetize ions (or even electrons) and to provide their Landau dissipation.  However, in isotropic plasmas, the ion-scale CSs inflate too rapidly with the distance from Earth to remain ion-scale at and beyond ~20 Earth?s radii, where most X-lines are observed.  A key to solving this problem was recently found due to the discovery of ?overstretched? thin CS (OTCS): If an ion-scale CS is embedded into a much thicker CS with even a weak field-aligned ion anisotropy, its current density iso contours can be stretched way more than the magnetic field lines.  The goal of this project is to investigate the structure, stability, and reconnection regimes of OTCSs to answer the following fundamental science question: What is the mechanism of the reconnection onset in the magnetotail, which explains its observed location far outside the near-Earth region, and what are its global implications?  The effects of the negative CS charging and electron current domination suggested by recent observations, interplay between tearing and ballooning/interchange modes, as well as roles of external driving and local magnetic flux accumulation, will be investigated using new OTCS equilibria in 2D and 3D PIC simulations.  The impact of OTCS on the global scale structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere will be assessed by adding their empirical reconstructions obtained by mining a multi-mission and multi-decade database of spaceborne magnetometers and new-generation magnetic field architectures to a global MHD model of the magnetosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

US part of the international research team is co-funded by NSF OISE/OD and CISE/CNS. <br/><br/>Cryptographic algorithms allow us to send secret messages over an otherwise insecure communication channel, such as the internet. These algorithms are extremely important since they enable several aspects of our digital lives, be it online banking, messaging services, mobile phone networks, and many more. To realize such protected communications and maintain the privacy of the parties talking to each other, government agencies set cryptographic standards for adoption. These standards serve as a common language for two devices to talk to one another while keeping the content of the exchange messages protected. For instance, in the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends, among others, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption/decryption in civilian communication. AES was chosen after a long competition where many candidates were considered and AES came out as the winning algorithm. Today, there are hundreds of implementations of AES in software form or in pure hardware form, i.e., implemented as a computer chip.<br/> <br/>Outside the US, many other standards exist. In Ukraine, a competition was also held which culminated in 2015 with the selection of Kalyna and Kupyna as the national standards. The existing software implementations of Kalyna and Kupyna have performance and security level comparable to their US counterparts. However, there is no known hardware architecture for the design of Kalyna or Kupyna. There is a need for Kalyna/Kupyna-capable hardware that displays (i) high performance; (ii) low power; (iii) tamper resistance; (iv) small footprint; and (v) physical security. This is the technical goal of this EAGER award, i.e., to execute a broad design space and security space exploration for the implementation of a block cipher (Kalyna) and a hash algorithm (Kupyna). This EAGER project represents a study on how to best implement these algorithms in a computer chip. The research team includes chip designers from the US and from Estonia, as well cryptography experts from Ukraine. The main technical outcome of the project is one fabricated chip containing several variants of the Kalyna and Kupyna algorithms. <br/><br/>This EAGER award also has dissemination goals. Knowingly, the country of Ukraine does not enjoy access to trusted chip fabrication technology. Chip design knowledge is also scarce. We strive to have Ukrainian universities teaching, in the near future, both software and hardware cryptographic engineering. The latter is specific knowledge that, today, is not adequately covered by any university in the country. In order to achieve this goal, the chip design tasks executed in this project will be highly reproducible: design resources will be openly shared on public repositories, including Verilog source files. Synthesis scripts for state-of-the-art commercial chip design tools will also be shared. Finally, the entire design process will be documented in order to showcase the entire concept of the Kalyna/Kupyna chip, step by step, from RTL to layout. This documented effort will be made openly available to the chip design and cryptographic communities at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on studying the structure of isogeny graphs in order to uncover faster algorithms for computing paths and cycles, leading to a better understanding of the security of isogeny-based cryptosystems. These cryptosystems could one day help secure the modern internet, so a concrete understanding of their security, and hence a concrete understanding of the difficulty of path-finding in isogeny graphs, is imperative. The research component is complemented by educational activities focused on incorporating project-based learning involving programming in undergraduate mathematics courses on number theory and cryptography.<br/><br/><br/>Isogeny-based cryptosystems base their security on the difficulty of computing an isogeny between two given supersingular elliptic curves. Such cryptosystems are attractive for their small public keys and their supposed resistance to quantum attacks.

The general supersingular isogeny problem is equivalent to the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of a given supersingular elliptic curve. The primary research goal for this project is to design and analyze algorithms for computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve.

However, building a mobile robot is challenging and expensive because robot system developers struggle to cost-effectively build, test, and maintain reliable software. There is a gap in our knowledge of the robotic system development process that hinders building software tooling to support that process. With current tools and techniques, it is especially hard to build a prototype robot that can be upgraded into a safe, reliable, and dependable mobile robot without having to start from scratch. This project aims to create lightweight techniques and software tools that help robot system developers build safer and more capable robots while remaining economically feasible. This work leverages advances in video game development tools to make it easier to test what a mobile robot should and should not do. Building mobile robots requires expertise in several areas, including electrical, mechanical, and software engineering, and coordinating information across these areas can be challenging. In addition to building special software tools, this project puts research and teaching together so that recent advances in engineering, called model-based engineering, can prepare students to be part of an interdisciplinary future workforce that can build, operate, and maintain more reliable mobile robots.<br/><br/>This project utilizes model checking of behavior trees and abstract type inference of physical units to automatically suggest system tests and to help ensure the absence of certain classes of software defects. Automated program analysis and testing are fundamental parts of modern software's continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), but robot developers struggle to automate, track, and assess system testing efforts. Current techniques fall short of the demands of heterogeneous co-evolution of software/hardware systems, especially when systems are validated in the field. The project aims to develop techniques for inferring robotic system test cases from existing artifacts that robot system developers are already using. Additionally, this project seeks to create techniques for inferring and comparing groups of physical units that are commonly used together to better understand programs and discover novel patterns in how physical units are used in robotic system implementations. The expected outcomes of this project include creating a software tool that helps developers detect and track the physical units that co-occur in their software, creating a tool that helps robot system developers measure how much of a behavior tree their system has exercised, and developing test case prioritization strategies for field testing of mobile robotic systems.

Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc.

Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A knot is a single tangled string with the ends tied; a link consists of several knots tangled together. Knot theory has wide applications in the natural sciences, such as in the study of DNA. A basic difficult question of knot theory is how to tell if two links are different: can one be deformed to the other without untying the ends of the strings? Associating polynomials to links is one way to tackle this problem. The aim of this project is to study polynomials in knot theory and other classical branches of mathematics by associating polytopes to them. Polytopes are geometric objects in arbitrary dimensions with flat sides. The study of 3-dimensional polytopes dates back to ancient times. The project also involves mentoring of graduate students as well as outreach to middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The support of a polynomial is the set of exponent vectors of its monomials appearing with nonzero coefficients. The Newton polytope of a polynomial is the smallest integer polytope containing its support. A polynomial has a saturated Newton polytope if every integer point in its Newton polytope is in its support. These notions extend to other bases besides the monomial basis. The goals of this project are (1) the study of saturation properties of classical multivariate polynomials with respect to various bases, such as the monomial and Schubert bases; (2) the study of the integer polytopes they give rise to; and (3) their applications to outstanding conjectures. An illustrative example of this approach is the recent progress by Hafner, Mészáros and Vidinas on Fox?s conjecture from 1962, which states that the absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link form a trapezoidal sequence. There are many combinatorial models for the Alexander polynomial which can be used to define combinatorial multivariate Alexander polynomials. For one such model, the support of an associated combinatorial multivariate Alexander polynomial of a special alternating link is the set of integer points in a generalized permutahedron. Such polytopal results, together with the theory of Lorentzian polynomials developed by Brändén and Huh, enabled the proof of log-concavity, and thus trapezoidal property, of the original Alexander polynomial in the case of special alternating links.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The locomotor capabilities of early tetrapods are often modeled with extant salamanders since the latter have a generalized tetrapod body plan. Yet, salamanders exhibit tremendous morphological diversity across environments, providing a framework to assess the mechanical requirements for terrestrial locomotion by comparing morphological change across carefully matched evolutionary lineages. The greater effects of gravity may impose biomechanical constraints that preclude certain salamanders from moving on land, but the habitat that salamanders occupy differs between developmental strategies. Metamorphosis involves the development of an animal across two or more distinct life stages but can be biphasic (aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults) or multi-phasic (aquatic larvae to terrestrial juveniles to aquatic adults) whereas direct development remains in one environment. Thus, biomechanical constraints may be stronger in terrestrial direct developers than biphasic metamorphers since the former do not experience an aquatic stage. This project will integrate physiology, engineering, and evolutionary biology to examine how the interplay between habitat preference and developmental strategy affects the relationship between the structure and function of tissues (e.g., bones) and whole-organism performance (e.g., locomotion). Students will receive research training through a new Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience on Organismal Form and Function and Professional Research Experience for Post-baccalaureates in Biology program. In addition, ?Salamander Safaris? will be hosted during Amphibian Week to promote the participation of students in STEM. <br/><br/>Locomotion places some of the highest physical demands (?loads?) on bones and failure to withstand loads could cause fractures or even death in an animal, yet how bones evolved to support the loads imposed by aquatic vs. terrestrial environments is not well understood. Phylogenetic comparisons of whole-bone mechanics across ecologically diverse species will advance knowledge of how habitat and developmental strategy has shaped the evolutionary morphology of salamander limb bones. Investigators will quantify in vivo bone loading during terrestrial walking through synchronized 3D kinematics and kinetics. Investigators will then apply these loading data to collect the first dynamic measures of limb bone strength by integrating mechanical property testing and 3D digital image correlation. Finally, they will combine these techniques to examine how bone mechanics is affected by water-land and land-water transitions within a lifetime by comparing juveniles and adults from species with different developmental strategies (i.e., direct, biphasic, multiphasic). Bone strength is predicted to be highest in terrestrial direct developers lowest in paedomorphic aquatic salamanders, and intermediate in biphasic metamorphic salamanders. Stronger bones likely assist terrestrial species to withstand internal (muscle) and external (ground reaction forces) loads and then transfer this energy into propulsion. Compared to the femur, the humerus is expected to evolve at faster rates based on the multi-functional role of forelimbs (e.g., digging, reproduction, locomotion) that is likely less constrained compared to hindlimbs whose primary role is for generating propulsion. Findings from this work will contribute new insights into the mechanical requirements of becoming terrestrial.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Randomness is used to understand image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, the behavior of financial markets, as well as in the analysis of large data sets in general. It is an important tool in the study of efficient computations and scientific simulations. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior.

These explorations are at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability, with the notion of group structure playing a key part.

The Zermelo-Frankel axioms of set theory (ZFC) emerged in the decades that followed as an answer to the question: what are the basic assumptions of mathematics? From the nine postulates of ZFC, one can derive all known theorems of mathematics. Despite this triumph of logic, a <br/>major problem remains: there are mathematical problems that cannot be solved assuming the ZFC axioms alone. Most famously, Godel and Cohen showed that starting with these axioms, it is impossible to prove or refute Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. One of the main goals of modern set theory is to analyze and classify axiomatic systems beyond ZFC that are strong enough to answer these undecidable questions. This project studies a framework for generating set-theoretic axioms by mining the structure of large cardinals in inner models of set theory. This project involves student training and conference organization and will have an impact on the philosophy of mathematics.<br/><br/>ZFC can be seen as an attempt to axiomatize the structure of the class of all sets. It is incomplete because our mathematical intuitions about arbitrary sets do not suffice to determine all their properties. To get around this problem, one can restrict attention to smaller subclasses of sets that are somehow canonical. Gödel discovered that there are subclasses that are rich enough to satisfy the ZFC axioms yet constrained enough that all their properties can be determined. Such a subclass is called a canonical inner model. For example, in canonical inner models, the Continuum Hypothesis is true. One obtains extensions of ZFC by considering the statements that hold in canonical inner models. One such statement is the Ultrapower Axiom, identified and studied by the PI in his dissertation. The axiom imposes a rich structure on the upper reaches of the hierarchy of infinite cardinals, or large cardinals, one of the central objects of study in set theory. Taking advantage of a recent breakthrough of Woodin, the PI was able to formulate strong generalizations of the Ultrapower Axiom, which this project proposes to study in hopes that they will shed further light on major open problems in inner model theory and large cardinals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen peroxide is an important product for numerous applications including clean water and as an efficient oxidant in chemicals manufacturing. However, it is currently produced at industrial scale via an indirect process that involves reactions of organic chemicals and requires large scales to be economical. For distributed manufacturing, it is desirable to develop a ?greener? process that directly reacts hydrogen with oxygen. However, new catalysts are needed to accelerate the rate of hydrogen peroxide synthesis and avoid side reactions that lead to complete hydrogen oxidation to water. Recent work has suggested that the application of certain organic coatings to common supported metal catalysts can improve hydrogen peroxide synthesis yields, however the way these improve performance is not understood.  Professors Nikolla and Medlin and their teams will systematically vary the properties of the organic-metal interface to identify molecular features associated with high hydrogen peroxide yields. They will also conduct reaction kinetic studies to understand how interactions between the reactants and organic coatings specifically lead to enhanced rates. The research will be carried out by a multi-institutional team that includes collaboration with international and national laboratory partners. The educational component of the project will include training and exchange programs for graduate and undergraduate students and development of new online educational tools related to the research problem.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professors Eranda Nikolla of the University of Michigan and Will Medlin of the University of Colorado Boulder are studying how the near-surface environment influences direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis on supported metal catalysts. Organic ligands are widely used in the synthesis of metal nanocrystals that can be employed as well-defined catalysts. While in many cases it is desirable to remove the ligands, in other instances the retention of ligands can lead to desirable catalyst performance. One important example in which ligand effects have been found to yield major selectivity improvements is the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd catalysts. While there have been some indications that the ligands function via (i) blocking of contiguous surface sites responsible for O2 activation and (ii) promotion of proton shuttling to adsorbed O2, the elementary-step mechanisms by which the coatings enhance selectivity in H2O2 direct synthesis are poorly understood. To develop structure-reactivity relations for hydrogen peroxide synthesis, Professors Nikolla and Medlin will systematically vary (a) the structure and density of ligands, (b) the metal nanoparticle size, shape, and composition, and (c) the solvent properties. The prepared materials will be characterized in depth and utilized in kinetic studies to understand the origins of selective catalysis. The project will involve collaborative efforts in nanoparticle synthesis, characterization of ligand-protected catalysts, reaction kinetic studies, and computational studies of chemistry at organic-modified metal surfaces. Although the project will emphasize the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the principles developed here can be extrapolated to diverse catalytic reactions, particularly since the elementary steps in direct synthesis and its undesired side reactions are broadly important in many chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Application of large pretrained models to customized tasks or new data is difficult since full retraining of the model is not possible due to the huge size and inaccesibility of the original training data.  The inaccessibility and large size of the training data also renders traditional domain adaptation techniques impractical. To overcome this challenge there has been shift towards modular adaptation methods that enable the fine-tuning of ""frozen"" pretrained models with minimal or no modifications to their internal parameters. Despite the success of these methods in some practical applications, there is a gap in theoretical understanding of the factors affecting the effectiveness of finetuning of pretrained models. This project develops a systematic framework that will lay theoretical foundations and lead to rigorous fine-tuning principles. The project has the potential to impact a wide range of scientific fields and industries that rely on adaptation of pretrained machine learning models. The project's broader impact includes the establishment of educational initiatives for advancing STEM, contributing to the development of the future workforce in modern machine learning.<br/><br/>The project's goal is to establish a unified theory and devise new algorithms with provable guarantees for the emerging paradigm of learning with frozen pretrained models. A mathematical framework will be developed to facilitate the theoretical analysis of the expressive power of frozen pretrained models under various adaptation and fine-tuning methods. The project will investigate three adaptation strategies: (1) parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which updates a minimal portion of the pretrained model's parameters while keeping the rest unchanged; (2) input/output processing, which involves modifying the input entering or the output produced by the pretrained models; and (3) model composition, which constructs a system of multiple pretrained models to address more complex tasks.

The approach is threefold: First, a holistic modeling framework will be developed to estimate uncertainties and enhance prediction accuracy for hemodynamic responses, integrating Bayesian inference, autoencoder learning, the unscented Kalman filter, and Bayesian optimization. Second, a novel control algorithm will be established, focusing on the safety and interpretability of dosing decisions, leveraging dose-response insights from Bayesian causal models, and optimizing reinforcement learning policies within a safety-centric framework. Lastly, the project will test and validate these advancements across various critical care scenarios, particularly in the management of circulatory shocks, and develop new testing methodologies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the autonomy.

Many studies suggest that training students through real-world, authentic opportunities such as work-integrated learning experiences and capstone design courses mimicking industry practices better prepare them for professional practice. Unfortunately, workplace contexts vary from company to company and position to position, negating any notion of mimicking all workplaces and industry practices students could encounter. Some authentic learning practices unintentionally exclude students whose life circumstances prevent them from taking advantage of such experiences. This project begins from a different starting point because a focus on what students know, such as theory or skills that support professional judgment, can inadvertently obscure exploration of the nature of knowledge itself and its effects on student learning. To facilitate students? transitions from education settings into the workforce, we need a better understanding of the organizing principles of knowledge which come into play when linking abstract theory to specific situations and applications. This project will contribute to the Research in the Formation of Engineers program by identifying teaching approaches instructors can use to better prepare students for the transition from education settings to the workforce. More broadly, this project is significant because it will explain how students learn what constitutes knowledge and how it is built ? a skill they can apply in any knowledge-oriented context including professional work.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to investigate the ability for undergraduate engineering students to translate engineering disciplinary knowledge acquired in tertiary education into professional settings to solve complex design problems. We call this process knowledge mobilization. We will apply a cutting-edge multi-dimensional conceptual framework for analyzing learning called Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) to characterize knowledge mobilization. We will investigate knowledge mobilization practices of mechanical engineering students who engage in varying levels of open-ended design problems through three contexts having increasing levels of open-ended and multidisciplinary design problems: 1) a junior level design-oriented course, 2) an engineering internship experience; and 3) a capstone design experience. The research will contribute fundamental knowledge on the ways in which students successfully or unsuccessfully mobilize knowledge. This project is creative and original in that it will combine LCT, a relatively unused approach in North America, with interpretive qualitative methodologies to provide in-depth insights from participants to reveal the organizing principles that affect successful or unsuccessful mobilization of knowledge independent of the students? level of understanding of the specific engineering concept. This knowledge structure perspective will build theory into the causes for student learning of engineering knowledge to remain locked within specific disciplines, such as fluid mechanics or solid mechanics. The outcomes of this research will enable instructors to orientate students more overtly towards the norms, values, and knowledge-oriented practices of engineering knowledge in professional settings. Outcomes include a professional development program to train students to use their engineering knowledge to solve problems in a professional setting. Unlike other professional development programs that teach specific skills such as interviewing, this program will develop a professional engineering metacognitive mindset to enable them to think beyond engineering theory and re-organize existing models so that they can adapt them in the face of novel and uncertain engineering situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to address these challenges and develop novel tools that make it easier for both new and experienced designers to create a wide range of high-quality products. These tools are expected to not only improve product quality and variety, but also enhance sustainable manufacturing. Additionally, the project includes an educational component to make STEM fields more accessible and engaging through design and manufacturing.<br/><br/><br/>To unite design precision with creative exploration, this project will develop tools that combine neural abstractions with formal reasoning. Treating computer-aided design (CAD) models as programs that generate geometry, this initiative interprets design as program synthesis, benefiting from formal reasoning and advancements in AI-driven code generation. This approach ensures verifiability and constraint-adherent synthesis, essential for precise engineering analysis. The project will develop a new domain-specific language (DSL) to better support AI-driven design, create algorithms for generating DSL programs from diverse inputs using models like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) integrated with geometric knowledge, and devise methods to identify and explore design variations efficiently. Additionally, it will establish techniques for design decomposition and recomposition, enhancing the DSL's flexibility and users? ability to innovate in design generation and iteration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their rich structural properties coupled with algorithmic tractability have led to numerous applications in discrete optimization, computer science, economics, combinatorics, and more recently in machine learning. Hypergraphs generalize graphs and are equivalent to finite set systems. Recent years have seen several new applications of hypergraphs in social network analysis, data mining and others, as well as in mathematics. Hypergraphs and submodular functions allow one to generalize numerous problems on graphs to a more abstract setting. Algorithms for these more general problems lead to powerful and unified tools for a variety of applications. Moreover, the abstraction often leads to important structural insights and simpler proofs. The research goal of this project is to develop algorithms for a class of problems that originate in graphs and generalize to hypergraphs and submodular functions. The educational goal of the project is to train two graduate students at the intersection of algorithms and combinatorial optimization, and to disseminate several recent developments in submodular functions, hypergraphs, and related graph theoretical results through courses and publicly available lecture notes. A workshop to bring together researchers working in these areas is also planned.<br/><br/>The technical portion of the project will focus on algorithms for partitioning and connectivity problems. For submodular functions, the project will investigate polynomial-time solvability of the partitioning problem for a fixed number of parts, which is a long-standing open problem.

Important examples include accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), product recommender systems, computer vision (e.g., occlusion removal or video editing), and bioinformatics (grouping of unlabeled data).  The focus is on algorithms that are fast, require communicating only small amounts of data, and work well in the data-scarce regime.  Algorithm speed is an important concern in all modern applications. Within MRI, it is essential for (near) real-time applications such as interventional MRI or on the fly identification and correction of artifacts, e.g., re-scanning if the patient coughs during the first scan.  Sample efficiency is critical for accelerating the MRI scan, or for learning user ratings of products from very few available ones. The project also supports Early Math education via the CyMath program, a program in which Math-loving graduate students provide after-school Math tutoring support for students as young as third graders. <br/><br/>This project introduces a novel solution framework called alternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization that provides a faster and more communication-efficient solution for many optimization problems for which alternating minimization (AltMin) is a popular solution. In particular, it is useful for any problem for which the minimization over one set of variables is much quicker than that over the other set. Starting with a careful initialization for one set, AltGDmin alternately updates the variables using minimization for the quicker set and gradient descent (GD) for the other set. Often, the reason that the minimization is fast over some variables is that the optimization problem is decoupled with respect to these variables. This decoupling also helps guarantee per-iteration communication-efficiency and privacy in federated settings. The use of minimization for one set of the variables is also what helps ensure sufficient error decay in each algorithm iteration. This implies that, for certain problems such as low rank column-wise sensing, AltGDmin is almost as fast and as communication-efficient per iteration as (factorized) GD, while converging almost as quickly as AltMin. This makes it faster overall than both types of solutions. Problem-specific correctness guarantees are derived. These determine the theoretical bounds on the iteration complexity and the sample complexity. Obtaining these results requires the development of novel proof techniques that may be of independent interest. The reason is AltGDmin is neither an AltMin approach nor a a standard GD algorithm for any subset of variables.  The design and analysis Byzantine resilient (secure) AltGDmin algorithms is being studied for various low rank, and other structure, recovery problems.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Computing and Communications Foundations (CCF) division of the Computer and Information Sciences Directorate (CISE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sintering of nano/microparticles is one of the critical steps in many AM processes. This step often leads to shape distortion of AM parts, preventing their near-net-shape manufacture. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports an integrated experimental and theoretical research to fully understand the mechanisms controlling shape distortion in AM. Such understanding will enable identification of critical AM process parameters to either eliminate distortions when undesirable, or to control distortions to enable novel methods of 4D printing. The outcomes of this project have the potential to reduce cost of AM parts, positively impacting aviation, automotive, and nuclear industries. The precision manufacturing enabled by this work will help establish American leadership in Industry 4.0. As AM is adopted in aerospace industry for fabrication of large parts (e.g., aircraft wings), research outcomes from the project will be key enablers for their fabrication. Near-net-shape AM will eliminate post-processing, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The project will involve collaboration with K-12 students from disadvantaged schools to expose them to STEM-based careers. The project will train a diverse US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of advanced manufacturing, computational sciences, and nanomaterials through the development of interdisciplinary curricula.<br/><br/>This project focuses on identifying the mass transport mechanism(s) and their relative contributions to shape distortion in sintering-based AM processes.

A predictive model will be developed to quantify the effect of parameters such as particle size(s), binder content, constraints, and temperature gradients on part distortion.

This research addresses one of the main challenges facing neuromorphic computing today -- How to make bio-plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) scalable and efficient for large-scale machine learning tasks while persevering the benefits of sparse, event-driven computation and learning? Currently, SNNs remain very similar to non-spiking networks with the temporal aspect remaining largely unexploited. The project is driven by the motivation that the current gap in SNN efficiency metrics (recognition accuracy, hardware power, energy and area efficiency) will be bridged by a transformative rethinking of spike information encoding in the temporal domain along with exploring nanoelectronic devices amenable for such alternate spike encoding schemes that leverage its inherent stochastic physics for brain-like probabilistic inference. Combining these two perspectives, stochastic biomimetic hardware, encoding information in the temporal domain, has the potential of enabling a new generation of brain-inspired computing platforms that leverages the associated advantages of two complementary insights from computational neuroscience -- how information is encoded in the brain and how computing occurs in the brain. The cross-layer nature of the project ranging from device design, circuit, system and algorithm explorations will serve as an ideal platform to enable interdisciplinary training and education of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The research involves a transformative research agenda, at the intersection of hardware and software, that develops a cross-layer design effort from devices to algorithms and underlying learning methodologies. The project spans cross-cutting explorations across the following thrust areas: (i) Thrust 1 investigates spin device physics and proposes device-circuit primitives suitable for temporal information encoding and learning in stochastic neuromorphic computing platforms. (ii) Thrust 2 considers system development that inherently exploits the temporal encoding of information in stochastic magnetic devices. (iii) Hardware-algorithm co-design resulting from Thrusts 1 and 2 will culminate in Thrust 3 that will consider large-scale system level simulations and performance evaluation across a benchmark application suite. Such an end-to-end framework can enable the fusion of appropriate neuromorphic computing paradigms with the intrinsic operation of the underlying hardware to improve its performance (classification accuracy) and efficiency for complex machine learning tasks. Successful completion of the project offers the basis for a significant leap in the quest to implement machine intelligence with brain-scale efficiency by pursuing a multi-disciplinary perspective spanning devices, circuits, systems, machine learning and computational neuroscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is presently a severe shortage of CS teachers that will be exacerbated as more schools embrace CS education. To help mitigate the teacher shortage, this project will implement a model to prepare middle school and high school Technology and Engineering (T&E) teachers in diverse New York State communities to teach CS courses. The implementation model is transferable nationally and this population of teachers can add significantly to the CS delivery system. Four complementary and unifying project components comprise a systems approach to broadening CS education capacity and participation. They are: component 1, implementing a statewide secondary school engineering design-based CS curricular continuum for T&E education with an aligned teacher professional development (PD) program; component 2, recruiting, engaging, and retaining diverse students by situating learning in the context of authentic, culturally relevant engineering design challenges; component 3, establishing a pathway to dual T&E/CS state certification for teachers; and component 4, fostering family engagement in CS education. The curriculum and PD programs integrate culturally relevant pedagogy to address barriers to broadening participation and persistence in STEM. The dual certification and family engagement in CS components are unique and innovative elements that can be adopted by myriad STEM preservice and school-based programs. The prototypical model is situated in twelve middle and high school classrooms in rural, suburban, and urban school districts which reflect New York State?s diverse population. <br/><br/>The project team will collect qualitative and quantitative data from 12 T&E teachers and approximately 300 students through participant interviews, surveys of teachers and curriculum developers, observations, PD institute feedback, results of pilot testing the curriculum including student performance data, student surveys, and teacher and family member reflections. Using mixed methods, the team will empirically and descriptively investigate how the various components synergistically serve as direct or mediator variables for target outcomes. Deliverables include a secondary school continuum of instruction using authentic engineering design challenges that integrate T&E and CS standards; PD materials to train educators to deliver the integrated content effectively; assessments to measure student learning outcomes and teacher growth; a certification pathway to dual T&E and CS state certification for teachers and accompanying training materials; resources to empower families to support their children?s CS learning; and research findings and insights from ongoing program evaluations and assessments. Expanding the CS delivery system through T&E in New York is a model for how T&E teachers nationwide can broaden CS participation. This project is positioned to contribute valuable knowledge, resources, and models that have the potential to shape the landscape of CS education, teacher preparation, and family engagement at both state and national levels.

For applications such as wearable and implantable biomedical sensors there is a particular need and opportunity for unobtrusive microdevices which operate autonomously as large ensembles to map physiological activity across a body area of interest. A challenge is how to construct a wireless network whereby data from a microsensor population is transmitted, received, and decoded to unravel data, say from 1000 individual sensors. A rough analogy is that of a population of common radio-frequency tags which must be read at once by a single transceiver - with the twist that signals at each sensor location will now vary both in time and in magnitude. A brain-computer interface suggests a paradigm in this context: how to capture neuronal signals at high resolution by a population of autonomous brain implanted microsensors. Ongoing research for development of brain-machine interfaces in laboratories worldwide is focused on a number of schemes where access to thousands of points in the cortex is sought to translate brain computations to useful electronic commands e.g. for intended speech. The neurotechnology problem is three-fold: to record electrical signals from the brain unobtrusively, to transmit the data wirelessly to a body external receiver, and to decipher the multitude of signals in real time. Many cases of distributed sensing of a dynamical environment are characterized by sparsity of events whether in nature or man-made systems, neurons in the brain being an example. The proposed event-driven communication strategy enables the efficient transmission, accurate retrieval, and interpretation of sparse events across a network of thousands of wireless microsensors ? using the brain as an inspiration. <br/><br/>The proposed work is focused on an all-in-one approach to build a large scale wireless microsensor radio-frequency network. An external transceiver collects data while supplying wireless power to the sensors. Each sensor is a sub-millimeter size silicon system-on-microchip with custom circuitry designed for ?event detection? where time-varying sensor inputs are encoded as a series of short ?spikes?. The brain-inspired method of encoding data from sparse events has emerged recently in so- called dynamic vision cameras. Spike train data are converted into digital form on chip and transmitted to one common receiver. Since only the event-driven spikes are transmitted through the network, the bandwidth of the communication system can be utilized very efficiently enabling a large population of sensors to be incorporated into the network.<br/>The team proposes to build a microsensor system and demonstrate low-error rate and efficient asynchronous, encoded wireless transmission in the laboratory using fabricated microchips, and to show extended applicability to thousands of nodes though simulations.<br/>Importantly, the event-sensing detection and wireless communication approach is quite suited for a neuromorphic computational approach for analyzing multisensory data; the third key element in the project. The team will show how to decode actual brain data (synthesized elsewhere from actual primate brain recordings) from a hypothetical implant composed of up to 8000 microsensors. Neuromorphic computing appears particularly suited decoding event-based data in terms of efficiency and short latency. Using available data from the primate motor cortex the team plans to show how to decode wireless signals from thousands of neurons for the prediction of planned arm and hand movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks similar results for other configurations, as well as sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of certain configurations (such as cycles and matchings) in graphs. This project also contains research problems related to cycles in graphs and matchings in hypergraphs that are suitable for graduate students.<br/><br/>This research project investigates two problems on graph coloring and graph structure. Hajos conjectured that graphs containing no subdivision of the 5-vertex complete graph are 4-colorable, which would generalize the Four-Color Theorem. Prior work on this conjecture led to the substantial understanding of the structure of those graphs, as well as its connections to several important problems concerning graph structures, including Lovasz's conjecture on non-separating paths and Thomassen's conjecture on 3-linked graphs.

For example, populations of tiny living things like bacteria, viruses and fungi, that can?t be seen with the naked eye.  Some microbes make us sick while others are important for our health.  Their balance or imbalance with each other and the surrounding tissues can exert long-lasting and wide-ranging effects on an individual?s state of health or disease. Of particular interest is the microbiota in the oral cavity, as it serves as a potential reservoir for pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria. However, very little is known about the relationship of various diseases and the oral microbiome. The research goal of this CAREER project is to understand the connection between the human oral tissue, the oral microbiome, and how they interact. This will be accomplished by creating an in vitro (in the lab) model of the human gingival (gum) tissue system capable of studying diverse microbial populations and their connection to overall human health.  The goal of the project?s educational plan, called ResAx, is to provide a working model to address the drop in enrollment in low resources academic institutions that could be transposed to other research areas (i.e., medical devices, protein engineering). The multidisciplinary research project will provide opportunities to expand research access and education to undergraduate students enrolled in the BME curriculum at University of Massachusetts Lowell and to support a paid Summer Training Program for rising junior high school students in the local Lowell community.  ResAx aims to provide equitable access to high-quality education experiences to more than 5,000 underserved students.<br/><br/>This CAREER project targets the development of an in vitro gingival tissue system to study the role of microbial communities on human oral health and disease, with potential repercussion on diverse pathologies such as periodontitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition to representing a large population and economic market, these chronic diseases are emergent drivers of global socioeconomic status. The vision of this CAREER project will be accomplished by: (i) the development and validation of a microphysiological system to study oral host-pathogens interactions and microbiome biogeography under different clinical conditions (healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis); (ii) the engineering of an inflamed gingivitis model based on human primary neutrophils to identify a clinical fingerprint for early dysbiosis presentation; and (iii) a periodontitis model based on activated B and T lymphocytes and clinically driven tissue characteristics to investigate the effect of lipid mediators on inflammation resolution and induced changes on the established polymicrobial community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current manufacturing paradigm treats the material processing stage (i.e., feedstock creation from raw ingredients) and the actual manufacturing stage (i.e., use feedstock to create final products) in a sequential and segregated manner. This sequential view results in a lack of system-level understanding which in turn adversely affects efficiency (production rate and product quality) and resilience (against material uncertainties and process disturbances). This project addresses this challenge by creating an interactive and integrated manufacturing ecosystem paradigm with a broadened system-level view ? aided by multi-disciplinary convergence of three disciplines: material science, manufacturing science, and control science. The research advances the science of manufacturing and strengthens the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem by developing computational models to understand materials-manufacturing interactions, and automation algorithms to enable efficient and resilient manufacturing. The research will be complemented by training of undergraduate and graduate students with special focus on underrepresented groups, multi-disciplinary educational material development, and tutorials and workshops for broader dissemination purposes.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the coupled nature of materials processing and actual manufacturing ? and the utilize this understanding to enable an automation framework towards integrated manufacturing ecosystem. The research objectives are: (i) quantification of the effects of raw ingredients on feedstock properties through an experimentally driven campaign, (ii) understanding of process physics with essential nonlinearities through a data-driven hierarchical modeling framework, and (iii) development of optimal control algorithms for coupled materials-manufacturing ecosystem. In the process, the following fundamental questions will be answered: (i) How to combine the knowledge of raw ingredients and their proportions to predict the rheological and physical properties of feedstock? (ii) How do the nonlinear interactions between feedstock properties and manufacturing dynamics impact the composite properties? (iii) How to formulate reduced order process models with acceptable computation requirements as well as enough physical insights? (iv) How to systematically combine knowledge of rheology and process physics and multi-modal data-stream to create an automation framework that ultimately enhances the feedstock quality in the material processing, and robustness of manufacturing environment?

As the cloud service provider (CSP) operates the hardware and privileged software, a malicious CSP can readily access or alter a customer?s sensitive data, while a bug in the CSP?s software can allow an attacker to do the same. To improve cloud security, the major chip designers recently added support for confidential computing: running a workload in a secure hardware enclave where the workload?s memory is encrypted, thus shielding it from the CSP. This proposal advances the knowledge for extending confidential computing to distributed services, an increasingly common type of cloud computing.  The proposed research will develop innovative, open-source systems software for organizations to make use of essential cloud services without sacrificing their privacy or the privacy of their users. To prepare the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners, planned activities include the mentoring undergraduates and outreach programs for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The proposal?s central research questions are: (1) how must protocols handle authentication and authorization when some nodes in the system are enclaves, and (2) how can protocols safely encompass a mix of trusted and untrusted nodes, including nodes that an attacker compromised. The proposal investigates these questions for two important existing protocols: Transport Layer Security (TLS) and cloud object storage. Specifically, the proposal seeks to extend TLS to allow an enclave to authenticate itself using a set of identities (such as its launch measurement, runtime measurement, and domain name), and explores the use of joint signature schemes to make such authentication efficient and elegant. Having support for complex endpoint authentication, the proposal then develops extensions to TLS for authorizing how enclaves may share data, thus enforcing the flow of information through a distributed system of diverse parties. Finally, the proposal explores storage protocol extensions that mitigate the damage of key compromise in a shared, encrypted cloud object store by using efficient, enclave-assisted, key rotation and data re-encryption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is motivated in part by a grand challenge in the field known as the hydrogen shot, with the target of reaching the production of hydrogen fuel at $1 per 1 kg within one decade. Green hydrogen is obtained as the product of one-half of the overall water splitting reaction. The other half, water oxidation, limits the overall efficiency of hydrogen generation and must be accelerated by earth-abundant catalysts to improve rates and lower costs. Boettcher?s group has developed several catalysts based on nickel, iron, and cobalt with efficient water oxidation ability that are promising for hydrogen technologies. With this grant, his group will study with molecular precision the underlying chemical principles and structures that dictate the high performance of these catalysts and whether these chemical principles hold under industry-relevant conditions.  This will be done by leveraging academic partnerships that facilitate rapid access to advanced surface characterization and computational techniques, and practical feedback from industrial collaborators. In addition to supporting work which will have a high impact on the field of catalysis, this grant will also provide key training to graduate and undergraduate students soon to enter the burgeoning renewable energy workforce, facilitate the continuation of educational outreach among students from the middle school to undergraduate level.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Shannon Boettcher and his research team are studying fundamental chemical descriptors for advanced alkaline water-oxidation catalysts. Water oxidation is characterized by slow kinetics and represents a key constraint in the performance of large-scale hydrogen production through water electrolysis. This oxidation reaction typically occurs on the surface of heterogeneous oxides/oxyhydroxides that are poorly defined, which makes relating structural, compositional, and electronic features to observed activity difficult. Fundamental catalysis science discoveries can address these challenging relations and, importantly, translate learned principles into improved technology for alkaline hydrogen production. With this grant, Prof. Boettcher and his team are building a fundamental understanding of active-site generation, retention, and loss for record-activity earth-abundant Fe-Ni/Co oxyhydroxides. Specifically, they will (1) study how the structure and properties of newly proposed surface Fe-oxo cluster active sites drive high activity in these transition-metal oxyhydroxides; (2) develop chemical descriptors to explain surface restructuring and activation of crystalline oxides (vs. amorphous oxides) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER);  and (3) understand if and how dynamic catalyst surfaces and Fe-based active sites drive record OER catalysis in high-temperature concentrated electrolyte conditions. The work seeks to build a more complete, temperature-dependent, thermodynamic and kinetic understanding of the materials and surface processes central to water oxidation at industrially relevant conditions. These aims will be studied through a combination of computation and experiment, with a significant focus on experiments conducted under operating conditions. Collaborative computational efforts by Prof. Maytal Caspary-Toroker at the Technion in Haifa, Israel, funded separately by the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation, is expected to provide new and more accurate approaches to modeling the thermodynamics and kinetic processes in these complex oxyhydroxides.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israel Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This history of deformation has significant effects on the performance of metals. Current theories to predict performance are highly complex, relying either on intricate approaches or tracking of many descriptors that have no memory path. These prior approaches are impractical for industrial applications. This award supports fundamental research to change this paradigm by developing a new formulation for predicting metallic alloy performance using fractional-order differential equations. In this new formulation, the history of the material is intimately intertwined with the underlying structure of the equations describing the material evolution process. The simplified mathematical description makes it attractive for widespread adoption. This paradigm shift in alloy modeling will improve safety by decreasing uncertainty in life predictions and sustainability as components can stay in service longer with confidence. Importantly, this award also includes outreach activities designed to encourage the participation of neuro-divergent students - students on the autistic spectrum - in STEM. This will be accomplished through involvement in autism-focused schools and education of college faculty to build awareness and greater acceptance for autistic students.<br/><br/>Accurate performance (mechanical response and lifetime) predicting capabilities will only be achieved by accounting for hereditary effects. Nonetheless, current models using, e.g., bounding surface theory or a large numbers of internal state variables (ISVs), with first-order ordinary differential equations, fall short in predicting history (hereditary) effects in metals and alloys. The reason is twofold: 1) there is a lack of understanding of the mechanism responsible for hereditary effects, and 2) the mathematical framework used so far for ISV theory employs first-order ordinary differential equations that are point functions and have, therefore, no memory path. This synergistic experimental and modeling approach will fill this knowledge gap by determining at which length scale hereditary deformation manifests and developing a fractional-calculus crystal-plasticity formulation with a material-informed order parameter depending on an activation volume. This fractional calculus formulation naturally incorporates hereditary effects into the structure of the evolution equations rather than directly through ISVs. The fractional-order crystal-plasticity modeling will be combined with state-of-the-art in situ experiments, i.e., high-temperature transmission electron microscopy and high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, to unify the mathematics and the physics of plastic deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the conventional Register Transfer Level (RTL) design approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project aims to facilitate the broader adoption of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools to significantly reduce design time, particularly for general architectural design. HLS tools enable higher-level programming and automatic synthesis, yet their application in comprehensive computer architecture studies remains limited. The significance of this project lies in promoting agile hardware development by fundamentally innovating HLS tools, overcoming the productivity challenges at the register transfer level, and unlocking the potential for more widespread application of HLS in diverse computing domains. The developed tool chain will be publicly available and exposed to more users by organizing tutorials, workshops, and demo events. The research will be integrated into education programs with activities on research training for undergraduate and master students, including online students, recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups, curriculum development, and innovative international design competitions co-hosted with industry.<br/><br/>This project aims to revolutionize High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools by introducing a next-generation tool, ArchHLS, addressing two major research challenges. First, HLS tools are superior in synthesizing a specific algorithm into hardware but have limited capability for general domain-specific architecture designs. Second, it is challenging to design general architectures with compatible compilers and to automatically improve the underlying architecture for evolving workloads. To address these challenges, ArchHLS facilitates agile hardware development by making three key innovations. First, ArchHLS decouples architectural design and workload mapping, allowing flexible architecture extraction and customized control flow. Second, ArchHLS automates architecture evolution to adapt to fast-changing algorithms via automated workload compilation, mapping, and computation pattern matching. Third, ArchHLS enables comprehensive and accurate performance profiling for designs to provide feedback for architecture evolution. Beyond advancing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tooling, this research has broader societal implications, aligning with the grand vision of sustainability for computing and computing for sustainability, such as climate modeling and scientific computing. The public availability of the toolchain fosters research dissemination, educational integration, and inclusivity efforts, aiming to benefit diverse communities and promote efficient algorithm/architecture co-design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach is enabled by the growing popularity of the Open-Source paradigm, where the source code of software packages is made available under licenses that allow reuse. This approach speeds up software development with significant economic benefits, but also creates the risk of inadvertently importing vulnerable code into critical software tools. The risk is further compounded by the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for code generation in Open-Source development. These tools must be trained on enormous amounts of data, which is not always rigorously reviewed, and thus they may learn to generate vulnerable code. To make matters worse, malicious parties may actively inject malicious code in their training set. Unfortunately, all these issues are still poorly understood. This project aims at measuring and mitigating the risks emerging from AI-generated code in the software supply chain. It will investigate how prevalent the use of AI tools is, and characterize the security risks they entail. In doing so, it will address pressing economic and societal needs: AI promises to bring significant benefits to software development, but those can only be achieved if its risks are mitigated. The research outcomes will be disseminated through workshops and hackathons, and the results will become part of curriculum and courses. The work will benefit the open-source community by producing provenance tools to improve software supply chain security.

This project consists of three thrusts, each addressing a research question relevant to the threat model: (i) how, and to what extent, LLM code can be distinguished from code written by humans; (ii) to what extent LLM code is already present in the supply chain, and what are its security implications; and (iii) to what extent poisoning attacks against LLM code generation can succeed in realistic conditions. In thrust (i), this project extends existing code stylometry techniques, until now used to distinguish human programmers, to the novel problem of distinguishing human- and LLM-generated code. In thrust (ii), the investigators conduct measurement studies of Open-Source software, generating empirical understanding of the presence and implications of LLM-generated code in the supply chain. Finally, thrust (iii) looks at the practical feasibility of code backdoors, and the effectiveness of automated reputation-based vetting as a defense.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With ageing, the volume of the hippocampus- part of the brain attributed to memory and learning, decreases. Exercise not only prevents this loss in volume, but increases the volume due to new neurons, and other brain cell. Biochemicals released by exercising muscle likely support this growth. But how they influence hippocampal cells remains a mystery. This project supports research that attempts to resolve this enigma by considering a transformative new paradigm wherein muscle contraction during exercise is transduced to contraction of hippocampal cells themselves. The results from the study may lead to reverse-engineering of pathologies, such as e.g., Alzheimer?s disease, depression, and anxiety that result in a diminished size and function of the hippocampus. <br/><br/>The project is based on the hypothesis that exercising muscle makes hippocampal cells contractile, and that this contractility results in new neurons from brain stem cells. The hypothesis is based on preliminary findings in the PIs? labs. The hypothesis will be tested by exercising mouse muscle tissue cultured on a petri dish. The biochemicals released by the exercising muscle tissue will be provided to mouse hippocampal cells extracted from mouse brain cultured on a dish. The effect of exercise on brain cells will be evaluated by measuring brain cell contractility and formation of new neurons on the dish. The hypothesis will also be tested in running and sedentary mice by quantifying relative expressions of brain proteins known to be responsible for cell contractility. The results of the study will be disseminated to the public through (1) exercise-brain presentations to diverse elderly populations; (2) development of a 5-part video series on exercise-brain interactions for social media; (3) Involvement of high school and undergraduate students in the exercise-brain research; and (4) presentations at the local library, campus open house, farmers market and local schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to sustain the U.S.'s global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, there is a growing demand for a skilled semiconductor workforce. High-schoolers are among the most frequent users of electronic devices. However, many do not know how these devices are designed and manufactured. To address the knowledge gaps and workforce needs, this project will develop a semiconductor curriculum for high-school-aged students, and with partners in higher education, K-12, and industries, enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) and other innovative technologies. Game-based semiconductor modules will be created for students to play and learn with peers choosing different avatars. These learning modules will be made available to a wide range of students through industry partners. In addition, approximately 50 students each summer (years 2-4) will be engaged in in-person workshops hosted in Maine and Texas. Through these workshops, students will be engaged in hands-on activities and field trips to semiconductor companies where they will connect their game-based learning with industry experiences. Based on students' feedback, the workshop and game curriculum will be designed and improved iteratively.<br/><br/>This Developing and Testing Innovations (DTI) project aims to help high-school students develop skills and career interests in the semiconductor fields through an innovative game-based learning platform, hands-on activities, and industry field trips. The overarching research question is: To what extent do the designs and integration of AI Educator (a generative AI tool for education), game-based learning, and hands-on experiences provide wide access and strengthen students' engagements, awareness, interests, and knowledge in STEM careers? The AI Educator will provide students with suggestions, assistance, and additional study materials about the subject matter. The AI component will be responsible for tuning the output content based on the student's interests, hobbies, and preferences to make the experience more relatable. Data collection will include students' attitudes, game activities, and hands-on learning outcomes. Design-based research methods will be used incorporating the NASA Task Load Index, t-test, interviews, and surveys to understand students' learning and efficacy of the game and workshop curriculum. The Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework will be used and refined throughout the AI and game technology integrations into the semiconductor curriculum and education pathways. The project will be designed with a focus on engagement and collaboration, catering to all students. <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

To study the relationships between what news is reported and how that affects human behavior, researchers need an easy way to search through lots of news articles. NewsScribe is a tool that lets scientists, educators, students, and the public search through over 1.5 billion online news stories from around the world. It adds about 500,000 new stories every day to stay timely and relevant. NewsScribe makes it easy to find information without needing to create or seek out large volumes of text. It organizes news sources in different collections by location and topic. This organization helps researchers quickly find the stories that are relevant to the questions they are studying. The activities supported by this award include updating the software and data at the core of NewsScribe and adding new user-friendly features and visualizations to make the tool easier to use. NewsScribe makes it possible for different types of researchers to study patterns in news reporting from around the world in new ways, at broader scales, over the last few years or the last few days.<br/><br/>There are many challenges involved in creating and maintaining such a large database while ensuring it will still be useful for so many different users. This project develops software that quickly collects and stores online news articles by processing them to pull out information like the publication date, language, and just the content of the article. New approaches to that process allow for pulling out more accurate data, handling more stories, and also returning search results faster. Various levels of alert systems notify the software team when some problem occurs with the daily processing of news stories, ensuring that the system is stable and reliable. The web-based search tools showing these results can sometimes hard to use, with a mix of tables of information, charts and graphs, and downloadable reports.

There is also an algorithmic analogue: for which objects can we solve hard problems efficiently? Having decided on the measure, one then asks: what information about the object guarantees that it can be classified as ""uncomplicated"" according to the chosen measure? ""Treewidth"" is a well-known measure of complexity in both structural and algorithmic graph theory. Many hard problems become tractable if the input graph is known to have small treewidth. Exhibiting a particular kind of a tree decomposition is also a useful way to describe the structure of a graph. This project studies the connections between the treewidth of a given graph and its local behavior. Graduate students will be involved in the project. The PI will also continue to popularize her work, and mathematics in general, through public lectures.<br/><br/><br/>This project intends to bring the powerful concepts of tree structures and non-crossing separations to the study of families of graphs defined by forbidden induced subgraphs. Several aspects of this program are outlined: from the familiar idea of upper-bounding the bag size, to tree-decompositions geared toward solving optimization problems, and applying tree-structures to the study of classical problems in graph theory. Different approaches are proposed for different possible applications. Progress on any of these aspects will advance the understanding of the structure of families of graphs defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, contribute to solutions of long-standing open problems, and have significant algorithmic consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Put simply, in many cases we do not know how or why machine learning algorithms work so well, which in turn limits our ability to safely deploy them in safety critical engineering and scientific scenarios. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical formalism and understanding of problems at the intersection of machine learning and science (i.e., scientific machine learning) using rigorous mathematics, leading to novel algorithms and computational methodologies that are interpretable, supported by rigorous theory, and aware of uncertainties.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the development of novel Gaussian Process (GP) based computational frameworks for scientific machine learning that are provably well-posed, robust, and stable, thereby meeting the high standards of scientific computing. The developed methodologies will be capable of rigorous uncertainty quantification and inherit the desirable properties of machine learning algorithms such as flexibility, generalizability, and applicability in high-dimensions. The efforts of the project are directed in three primary directions: (1) GPs for solving nonlinear, high-dimensional and parametric PDEs; (2) GPs for operator learning, emulation, and physics discovery; and (3) GPs for high-dimensional sampling, inference, and generative modeling. Each research direction focuses on the development of algorithms, foundational theory, and concrete applications in engineering and science.

Automated workflows will be created to accelerate catalyst discovery by identifying modular structures that can be assembled from smaller molecular building blocks. This fundamental science will be enabled by new mechanistic  collaborations with experimentalists that broaden the horizons of the participating scientists at Colorado State University.

While all atoms in chemical compounds are held together by bonds, not all bonds are created equal.  Some bonds, such as carbon-oxygen bonds, are strong and found everywhere in Nature.  Others, including multiple bonds between late transition metals such as iridium and oxygen or nitrogen atoms, so-called iridium-oxo or -nitrido bonds, are rare.  They are interesting both because of their scarcity and because they are likely to be reactive enough to be useful in forming new chemical bonds and thus acting as catalysts or reagents to promote cleaner and more efficient preparation of useful substances.   The working hypothesis underpinning these studies is that the metal-nitrogen bonds may be more stable than previously believed, with the difficulty being in finding ways to prepare them.  In contrast, the metal-oxygen bonds may only be stable if the iridium atoms have other designed groups surrounding them.  Dr. Brown will also work to develop new materials and approaches to help teach chemical principles about the rates of reactions (chemical kinetics) in ways that will be accessible and engaging to a wide audience.  This will include developing experiments that can be conducted with readily available household materials, and working out ways to measure color changes over time using cell phone cameras.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Seth Brown and his team at Notre Dame will develop synthetic approaches to terminal oxo and nitrido complexes of late transition metals such as iridium.  Such compounds are rare, and in tetragonal (octahedral or square pyramidal) environments unknown, due to the so-called ?oxo wall? originating in their high d electron count in accessible oxidation states.  The hypothesis that iridium nitrides will actually be sufficiently stabilized by the nitrido ligand to exist in the +7 oxidation state, heretofore deemed inaccessible, will be pursued using ancillary ligands that are either redox-active, allowing the iridium to jump from a common iridium(III) oxidation state (iminoxolenes, calix[4]pyrrolides) or ones that stabilize an uncommon iridium(V) precursor (alkyls or aryls).  Oxo compounds will be sought using iminoxolene or dioxolene ligands capable of electronic stabilization of the oxoiridium moiety.  Any oxo or nitrido compounds that can be generated will be subjected to physical characterization to illuminate their bonding, and their reactivity with organic substrates will be analyzed to see how the novel electronic structures can be used to effect useful oxidations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will develop a universal framework for the simultaneous design of control policies and safety measures based on recent advances in the mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. In this context, the intersection between safety, control systems, and data-driven methodologies is still nascent and there are major hurdles to overcome for the adoption and acceptance of the safe data-driven paradigm despite the immense progress in data processing capabilities. This project will solve these challenges through the automatic synthesis of safety-aware control laws for highly complex systems as a function of their real-time input-output information. The outcomes of this work will be well-suited for a variety of applications in engineering, biology, and manufacturing that are of essential significance for the economic development and the competitiveness of the nation on the global stage. The project?s research objectives are complemented by a methodical industry outreach and pedagogical plan aimed at blending research and education, strengthening industry collaboration, and boosting the participation of underrepresented communities for the benefit of society at large.<br/><br/>The researched framework leverages the algebraic structure of a novel framework for system representation that systematically encodes its input-output behavior, namely the Chen-Fliess framework. This encoding naturally fits the underpinnings of the data-driven paradigm for control and estimation. This methodology essentially enables the use of algebraic optimization routines on the system?s information, by eliminating the need for a state-space coordinate frame that otherwise will require over-parametrizations that can lead to infeasibility. Consequently, faster and less power-consuming optimization algorithms are researched with the capability of retaining the system?s input-output behavior. Thus, reachability analysis and synthesis of the control barrier functions will then be performed under this algebraic framework to advance these methodologies in the data-driven setting. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) provide an algebraic framework for the analysis and optimization of data-driven control systems, (2) develop input-output reachability analysis in the Chen-Fliess framework, and (3) develop data-driven methods for the synthesis of safe control laws based on reachability analysis and control barrier functions in the Chen-Fliess framework. The researched work will be validated on autonomous vehicles, a multi-robot system performing simultaneous localization and mapping, and a data-driven power system regulation problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research advances the science of manufacturing and strengthens the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem by developing computational models to understand materials-manufacturing interactions, and automation algorithms to enable efficient and resilient manufacturing. The research will be complemented by training of undergraduate and graduate students with special focus on underrepresented groups, multi-disciplinary educational material development, and tutorials and workshops for broader dissemination purposes.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the coupled nature of materials processing and actual manufacturing ? and then utilize this understanding to enable an automation framework towards integrated manufacturing ecosystem. The research objectives are: (i) quantification of the effects of raw ingredients on feedstock properties through an experimentally driven campaign, (ii) understanding of process physics with essential nonlinearities through a data-driven hierarchical modeling framework, and (iii) development of optimal control algorithms for coupled materials-manufacturing ecosystem. In the process, the following fundamental questions will be answered: (i) How to combine the knowledge of raw ingredients and their proportions to predict the rheological and physical properties of feedstock? (ii) How do the nonlinear interactions between feedstock properties and manufacturing dynamics impact the composite properties? (iii) How to formulate reduced order process models with acceptable computation requirements as well as enough physical insights? (iv) How to systematically combine knowledge of rheology and process physics and multi-modal data-stream to create an automation framework that ultimately enhances the feedstock quality in the material processing, and robustness of manufacturing environment? While the effectiveness of such a framework will be evaluated by using a laboratory-scale extrusion-based additive manufacturing system, it is anticipated that the framework can be broadly applied to any manufacturing systems as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses one of the main challenges facing neuromorphic computing today -- How to make bio-plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) scalable and efficient for large-scale machine learning tasks while persevering the benefits of sparse, event-driven computation and learning? Currently, SNNs remain very similar to non-spiking networks with the temporal aspect remaining largely unexploited. The project is driven by the motivation that the current gap in SNN efficiency metrics (recognition accuracy, hardware power, energy and area efficiency) will be bridged by a transformative rethinking of spike information encoding in the temporal domain along with exploring nanoelectronic devices amenable for such alternate spike encoding schemes that leverage its inherent stochastic physics for brain-like probabilistic inference. Combining these two perspectives, stochastic biomimetic hardware, encoding information in the temporal domain, has the potential of enabling a new generation of brain-inspired computing platforms that leverages the associated advantages of two complementary insights from computational neuroscience -- how information is encoded in the brain and how computing occurs in the brain. The cross-layer nature of the project ranging from device design, circuit, system and algorithm explorations will serve as an ideal platform to enable interdisciplinary training and education of graduate and undergraduate students including women and underrepresented minority communities.<br/><br/>The research involves a transformative research agenda, at the intersection of hardware and software, that develops a cross-layer design effort from devices to algorithms and underlying learning methodologies. The project spans cross-cutting explorations across the following thrust areas: (i) Thrust 1 investigates spin device physics and proposes device-circuit primitives suitable for temporal information encoding and learning in stochastic neuromorphic computing platforms. (ii) Thrust 2 considers system development that inherently exploits the temporal encoding of information in stochastic magnetic devices. (iii) Hardware-algorithm co-design resulting from Thrusts 1 and 2 will culminate in Thrust 3 that will consider large-scale system level simulations and performance evaluation across a benchmark application suite. Such an end-to-end framework can enable the fusion of appropriate neuromorphic computing paradigms with the intrinsic operation of the underlying hardware to improve its performance (classification accuracy) and efficiency for complex machine learning tasks. Successful completion of the project offers the basis for a significant leap in the quest to implement machine intelligence with brain-scale efficiency by pursuing a multi-disciplinary perspective spanning devices, circuits, systems, machine learning and computational neuroscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By 2030, it is estimated that over 26 million new cancer cases will arise, with more than 10 million potentially treatable through thermal ablation. Current techniques, however, often compromise healthy tissues due to uncontrolled heat spread, or they risk tumor recurrence by failing to eliminate all cancer cells. This project is dedicated to advancing Tumor Precision Ablation (TPA), a technique designed to precisely control the dispersion of heat in tissues once it is separated from its source. This approach is especially crucial for asymmetrically shaped tumors. The project's vision is to advance science and technology to transform cancer treatment by developing safer and more effective ablation methods. These advancements are particularly vital for treating brain tumors and other diseases where tissue ablation is a key therapeutic strategy, including liver, lung, kidney, and bone tumors, epilepsy foci, motor circuits in movement disorders, and vascular abnormalities in the brain. Integral to this project is an educational plan designed to involve students in STEM. This plan includes developing interdisciplinary courses that intersect with majors such as electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, and oncology. It offers research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, particularly through programs like Vertically Integrated Projects. Furthermore, it provides mentorship opportunities for graduate students to aid their career development. Outreach activities will be organized for sharing resources, tools, and knowledge with teachers and students, amplifying the project's impact. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a novel ablation catheter, a first in its field, tackling specific scientific challenges in modulating heat penetration and direction during thermal ablation procedures. The core scientific advancements encompass three main areas: (1) Limiting Heat Penetration through a new method that alternates heating and cooling to create a zero-temperature gradient at the tumor boundary, aiming to prevent damage to adjacent healthy tissues; (2) Directing Heat by exploring the interaction between the physics of ultrasound and heat propagations, and modeling this interference, using low-power ultrasound waves to precisely direct heat within tumors of asymmetrical shapes; (3) Real-time Monitoring employing innovative ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors for continuous tracking of the ablation progress, thus enabling accurate and immediate closed-loop control of ablation penetration depth. The proposed research plan comprises three phases of evaluation and assessment, including in vitro tests and in vivo experiments with tumor-bearing small animals. The project's innovative approach in developing this TPA catheter, integrating a heat producer-absorber module for applying an alternate heating and freezing process, ultrasound arrays to direct the heat in the desired direction, and UWB sensors for ablation depth detection, signifies a leap forward in our understanding of heat flux in tissues. This innovative approach is anticipated to greatly influence the fields of microelectronics, heat transfer, and tumor treatment, opening new avenues in precision medicine research and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emergence of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to numerous breakthroughs in the classification of von Neumann algebras beyond the amenability setting, and approximation properties, such as Ozawa's notion of a biexact group, have created new opportunities to study approximation properties in the setting of von Neumann algebras. The research developed in this project investigates these approximation properties, creating new connections between C* and von Neumann algebras.

Biological macromolecules frequently transition across multiple conformational structures, and the nature and prevalence of these structures is of great significance to both their intrinsic biological functions, and their potential applications as drug targets, biomarkers, and building blocks in nanostructures. With a focus on RNA and DNA, the Widom Lab is establishing methods based on high-resolution laser spectroscopy that extract distinct signatures from macromolecules with different structures, and is expanding the toolbox of well-characterized molecular probes that can be used for such measurements. In addition, Dr. Widom is partnering with the UO undergraduate Chemistry Club to engage in outreach to middle- and high-school students in rural Oregon communities through remote, interactive chemistry activities, site visits to UO by rural students, and collaboration with the chemistry program at Eastern Oregon University.<br/><br/>Most existing spectroscopic techniques are sensitive to either the local (Angstrom length-scale) or global (nanometer length-scale) structure of the system being measured. To overcome this limitation, Dr. Widom?s research group is developing a method based on measurement of fluorescence spectra on an ultrafast timescale, utilizing excited-state energy transfer between two probes to separate signals from tightly and loosely folded conformational subpopulations. Global fitting of the resulting time-resolved emission spectra connects the local environments of the two probes to the global conformations of the macromolecule within which they reside. Structured DNA and RNA oligomers with at least two well-defined global conformations will be used as model systems, followed by expansion of the technique to study the binding of small molecules to RNA. The Widom Lab will also investigate the suitability of different fluorescent probes for applications involving nucleic acids, analyzing their photophysical properties and their impacts on RNA structure.

Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption.

Pile response to vibrations from earthquakes is affected by changes in soil properties from increasing temperatures. Alaska has more earthquakes than any other region of the United States and is, in fact, one of the most seismically active areas of the world. Infrastructure is now being damaged by both thaw-related settlements and frequent seismic activity because mechanical properties of permafrost are temperature dependent and soil temperature variation significantly impacts seismic vibrations in the permafrost region. Consequently, dynamic behaviors of a soil-pile foundation system, which are critically important to the stability of a structure, cannot be predicted from measurements taken from permafrost or non-permafrost regions only. This research will characterize and assess the impact of ongoing permafrost degradation on the dynamic behaviors of pile foundations in the face of seismic hazards. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduates from Clarkson University and the University of Alaska Fairbanks; they will assist with instrumentation, soil testing, in situ tests, and data processing. In addition, an educational and outreach program for middle school science classes that demonstrates dynamic response of model piles in layers of soil will be implemented. <br/><br/>The goal of this ERI research project is to characterize the dynamic behaviors of pile foundations in degrading permafrost, knowledge that could be used to develop resilient, sustainable designs for piles subject to earthquakes and climate change, and increase service life while reducing maintenance and operation costs of infrastructure. To achieve this goal, two objectives will be pursued: (1) characterization of the effects of thickness and distribution of frozen and unfrozen soil layers on the dynamic stiffness and damping of soil-pile systems using laboratory-scale tests; and (2) investigation of seasonal freeze-thaw effects on the dynamic behavior of piles in Alaska permafrost using in situ vibration testing. The following fundamental questions will be answered: (1) How does the temperature distribution of the ground affect the dynamic behavior of the soil-pile system in discontinuous permafrost regions? and (2) What is the role of changes in thermomechanical properties of the soil layers caused by freeze-thaw in the dynamic response of pile foundations? By integrating experimental results from both laboratory and field tests, the research will improve the model of a dynamic beam on a nonlinear Winkler foundation for permafrost regions. This research will provide the basis for developing and investigating innovative foundation solutions for continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, thereby increasing community resilience in the Arctic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New set-based dynamic modeling and control frameworks will be developed to account for the complex and uncertain behaviors of thermal management systems to make them trustworthy and reliable in safety-critical applications. To support the electrification of power systems, thermal management systems have become highly-integrated safety-critical elements of these complex energy systems. However, the lack of modeling and control techniques capable of safely maximizing the capability of thermal management systems makes them a bottleneck and liability within the overall system. This project will solve this challenge and achieve trustworthy thermal management systems operations via set-based techniques to capture uncertainty and bound worst-case behaviors, systematic allocation of risk to account for structured and unstructured sources of uncertainty, and verification of interpretable and analyzable closed-loop controllers under all possible system operations. The modeling, control, analysis, and verification techniques in this project are cross-cutting and applicable to other safety-critical dynamic systems with nonlinear and hybrid dynamics. Through close integration of research and education, this project will train multi-disciplined engineers in the intersection of thermal energy management, dynamic systems modeling, and advanced control to meet the increasingly critical workforce demand for thermal controls engineers. This will be achieved through hands-on project-based learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels and undergraduate research opportunities designed to provide multi-disciplinary engineering education and broaden participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the design and analysis of scalable, high-performance, and provably safe controllers for complex energy management systems. It will achieve this goal by developing set-based modeling and control techniques for thermal management systems, which provide the potentially transformative paradigm needed to make these systems trustworthy. This research will create frameworks for set-based modeling and control with rigorous formulations and guarantees to achieve trustworthy thermal management systems operation, integrate systematic risk management in closed-loop decision making to balance performance and safety in highly uncertain operational environments, and extract interpretable and analyzable control laws from optimization-based control formulations for dependable real-time system operation. The novel hybrid zonotope set representation provides the enabling and unifying capability to represent and bound the hybrid and nonlinear dynamics associated with thermal management systems and the control laws designed to optimize their operation. This research will be evaluated through application to thermal management systems modeling and control for high-performance aircraft in a hardware-in-the-loop implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Guanine has the lowest oxidation and ionization potential among DNA nucleobases, leading to the preferential formation of the radical cations of guanine and 8-oxoguanine upon the oxidation and ionization of DNA. Reactions of these radical cations are difficult to study in solution due to their rapid deprotonation and the inability to separate, detect, and characterize products. Professor Liu and his students will study the reactions of these radical cations with NO and NO2 in a rarefied gas-phase environment where individual products can be measured. These studies are expected to provide a better understanding of DNA damage upon oxidative, nitrosative, and nitrative stress. The students working on this project will gain experience in reaction dynamics, instrumentation development, and computational modeling.  Queens College is a Minority Serving Institution, with 40% of students from traditionally underserved groups. This project have direct implications for diversity and broadening participation, including collaboration with LaGuardia Community College to transfer qualified students from an associate degree to the Chemistry B.S. program. Many of the instruments developed for research will also used in undergraduate laboratory courses.<br/><br/>The project will utilize electrospray ionization and guided-ion beam tandem mass spectrometry to conduct ion-molecule reactions wherein the radical cations of guanine and 8-oxoguanine are produced by electron-transfer induced-dissociation of Cu(II)-nucleobase complexes.

Experiments will be complemented by electronic structure calculations, dynamics simulations, and kinetic analysis. The in-house, synergetic experiments and computations should allow for interpretation of various aspects of reaction mechanism and non-adiabatic kinetics. A major thrust of this research is to benchmark experiment and theory for tackling multireferential characters and non-adiabatic transitions in doublet-doublet electronic-state reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This history of deformation has significant effects on the performance of metals. Current theories to predict performance are highly complex, relying either on intricate approaches or tracking of many descriptors that have no memory path. These prior approaches are impractical for industrial applications. This award supports fundamental research to change this paradigm by developing a new formulation for predicting metallic alloy performance using fractional-order differential equations. In this new formulation, the history of the material is intimately intertwined with the underlying structure of the equations describing the material evolution process. The simplified mathematical description makes it attractive for widespread adoption. This paradigm shift in alloy modeling will improve safety by decreasing uncertainty in life predictions and sustainability as components can stay in service longer with confidence. Importantly, this award also includes outreach activities designed to encourage the participation of neuro-divergent students - students on the autistic spectrum - in STEM. This will be accomplished through involvement in autism-focused schools and education of college faculty to build awareness and greater acceptance for autistic students.<br/><br/>Accurate performance (mechanical response and lifetime) predicting capabilities will only be achieved by accounting for hereditary effects. Nonetheless, current models using, e.g., bounding surface theory or a large numbers of internal state variables (ISVs), with first-order ordinary differential equations, fall short in predicting history (hereditary) effects in metals and alloys. The reason is twofold: 1) there is a lack of understanding of the mechanism responsible for hereditary effects, and 2) the mathematical framework used so far for ISV theory employs first-order ordinary differential equations that are point functions and have, therefore, no memory path. This synergistic experimental and modeling approach will fill this knowledge gap by determining at which length scale hereditary deformation manifests and developing a fractional-calculus crystal-plasticity formulation with a material-informed order parameter depending on an activation volume. This fractional calculus formulation naturally incorporates hereditary effects into the structure of the evolution equations rather than directly through ISVs. The fractional-order crystal-plasticity modeling will be combined with state-of-the-art in situ experiments, i.e., high-temperature transmission electron microscopy and high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, to unify the mathematics and the physics of plastic deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Uncertainty in this prediction arises, however, from difficulty observing the thickness and mechanical strength of sea ice over large parts of the Arctic Ocean using just satellite and aircraft technology. One approach to addressing this difficulty is through seismology - the study of ground vibrations - along the coastline of the Arctic Ocean. The main scientific activity of this project will be to observe special ground vibrations that are generated by or otherwise influenced by sea ice.  One such signal is called ?microseism?, and is a constant ?thrumming? of the ground caused by waves in the ocean both near and far from the coastline. The project will use existing, virtually continuous seismic data from various stations along the northern coasts of Alaska, Canada and Greenland to detect how this microseism changes with season and from year to year.  The scientific outcome to be achieved is the creation of a continuous time history of how sea-ice thickness and strength have evolved over the past several decades.  In addition to the scientific goals of the research project, broader impact activity will be focused in two areas. First, the project will interface with artists in the Chicago area to develop ways in which musical expressions can be developed to convey how climate change is affecting Arctic sea-ice conditions. This science and art interaction will build on previous musical compositions that involved interpretation of seismic data coming from icebergs in Antarctica. Second, the project will seek to advance the new Climate Systems Engineering initiative of the University of Chicago by advocating for and facilitating community dialogue about the pros and cons of glacial geoengineering as a way to mitigate the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>We propose to investigate whether microseism spectral power density observations can be used to constrain sea-ice properties such as concentration, thickness, and ?strength? (the ability to attenuate flexural gravity waves generated by sea swell) in the North American sector of the Arctic Ocean (also known as the ?last ice area? where the transpolar drift impinges on the North American continent and Greenland). Data to be used are from coastal seismometer stations located in Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Greenland. Sea-ice data will be obtained from the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. The microseism power in the 0.1-3 s period band (as in Tsai and McNamara, 2011), and possibly other frequency bands, will be related to a proxy for sea-ice strength (involving sea-ice concentration and the tendency for sea ice to absorb wind stress as indicated by sea-ice drift and surface wind data) and compare with remote sensing observations. The goal of this study is to obtain the highest possible resolution of sea-ice data empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) from the simplest possible EOFs of the microseism data. This involves seeking data-inversion algorithms that can optimize ?resolving power? by minimizing ?spread? in the linear operator that connects the EOFs of microseism with sea ice. The algorithms will then be categorized by their ability to resolve aspects of sea-ice data that go beyond the simple sea-ice concentration data that is otherwise routine and easy to be constrained with satellite data. Depending on the outcome of this assessment, seismic microseism observation can potentially provide complementary information to improve sea-ice data and thus facilitate better climate-model predictions. With regard to broader impact activity, the project will provide a local artist consortium in Chicago with short segments of seismic data portraying tremor and other signals generated by sea ice. These data will be sped up to allow their frequencies to be audible, and will serve to inspire musical compositions either directly or indirectly (e.g., where musical instruments are used to mimic the seismic data). Additional broader impact activity will be undertaken to appropriately advocate for community conversations about glacial geoengineering. This advocacy will take the form of organizing Town Hall meetings for the American Geophysical Union and writing white papers to help inform the Polar Research Board of the US National Academy of Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To realize operational quantum advantage for computing, and to improve precision for sensing, timekeeping, and fundamental physics measurements, the number of trapped ions in these systems must be scaled up. Yet, this would require laboratories full of sensitive, complex equipment, limiting their portability, scalability, and accessibility to broader communities. The PI proposes a transformational approach that converges trapped ion quantum research with integrated photonics research to solve these problems and demonstrate their application to quantum and fundamental physics problems. This research will transform the stability of these systems and advance the state-of-the-art performance, resulting in trapped ion physics experiments that are more reliable and accessible, and allow these technologies to propagate to new fields of research and applications. This convergence research will be augmented with development of multiple hardware, integration, and software open-source tools to enable customized trapped ion physics experiments, so they are accessible to broader audiences and applications.

To achieve high fidelity qubit operations, the project will investigate new nanofabrication techniques, rapid packaging, and co-design of ion traps with new integrated photonics to utilize atomic transitions more resilient to errors. To scale the platform, the project will work on miniaturizing not just the optical delivery with photonic grating couplers but also the optical stabilization and control through monolithic integration of advanced photonics within the trapped ion processor itself. For trapped ion optical clocks, eliminating phase instability between the laser reference and the trapped ion though monolithic integration would enable portable operation resilient to vibration. This resilience also improves the reliability of trapped ion systems, removing operational overhead and complexity, thus making them easier to scale and more accessible to applications outside the laboratory. To foster broader adoption of these technologies the project will develop multiple open-source tools, including process design kits, ion trap surface simulation, and modular optical layout libraries. Altogether, the development of a new integrated trapped ion platform co-designed with integrated photonics will improve their performance, portability, and scalability with transformative impacts on quantum computing, sensing, timekeeping, and measurements of fundamental physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sociotechnical thinking in engineering emphasizes that technical solutions are embedded in social contexts, and understanding the interaction between engineering solutions and sociotechnical factors is vital to designing effective solutions. To help engineers engage in sociotechnical thinking, we need to understand how their understanding and reasoning about sociotechnical factors evolves. While sociotechnical thinking is a critical engineering competence, the progression from novice to expert is not well understood. This project will combine cognitive science with sociotechnical design theories to chart the development of sociotechnical thinking in engineering. We will use scenario-based design tasks to examine the ways engineers think and reason sociotechnical factors and focus specifically on the ways this reasoning evolves as engineers gain experience in education and practice. We will also use interviews to investigate experiences that enable engineers to think and reason more deeply about sociotechnical factors. The outcome of this research will be a model of sociotechnical development that characterizes the relevant dimensions of sociotechnical thinking (e.g., ethical implications, stakeholder engagement, environmental considerations, social/cultural impact) and the different ways engineers reason about those dimensions as they gain experience. This research will offer insight into how engineers develop new outlooks, perspectives, and ways of thinking and reasoning. By collecting data from students and professionals with different levels of experience, the model can provide a map for engineering educators to scaffold learning in developmentally appropriate ways across education and practice, resulting in an engineering workforce that can solve complex problems more effectively with innovative solutions. <br/><br/>This project will use qualitative methodologies across two sequential research phases. In Phase 1 we will create a developmental model of sociotechnical thinking using data collected from engineering students and professionals with varying levels of experience. We will collect qualitative data through scenario-based design activities that elicit sociotechnical considerations and retrospective focus groups that allow for follow-up and deeper exploration. We will analyze the data using a combination of theories of sociotechnical thinking in engineering and cognitive development, iteratively applying deductive and inductive coding. The resulting model will describe two key aspects of sociotechnical thinking in engineering: 1) the relevant dimensions along which development occurs and 2) the qualitatively different ways engineers think and reason about those dimensions. Cross-sectional sampling will enable investigation of the progression in sociotechnical thinking according to engineering experience. Phase 2 will use recursive data collection through interviews to explore themes in formational experiences in sociotechnical thinking. Cognitive development is often punctuated by moments of dissonance and resolution, and interviews will focus on formative experiences in sociotechnical thinking. We will stratify our participants according to their developmental categories and recruit participants from Phase 1 to explore engineering experiences that promoted growth or change in sociotechnical thinking. To help engineers effectively engage in sociotechnical thinking, educators must also understand how sociotechnical thinking changes and varies across engineers with different levels of education and experience. Focusing on developmental aspects of a critical engineering skill can inform engineering educators in terms of curriculum design and professional development. The results of this work will inform engineering education and practice in ways that can promote more thoughtful engineering practices and better, more appropriate engineering solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to sustain the U.S.'s global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, there is a growing demand for a skilled semiconductor workforce. High-schoolers are among the most frequent users of electronic devices. However, many do not know how these devices are designed and manufactured. To address the knowledge gaps and workforce needs, this project will develop a semiconductor curriculum for high-school-aged students, and with partners in higher education, K-12, and industries, enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) and other innovative technologies. Game-based semiconductor modules will be created for students to play and learn with peers choosing different avatars. These learning modules will be made available to a wide range of students through industry partners. In addition, approximately 50 students each summer (years 2-4) will be engaged in in-person workshops hosted in Maine and Texas. Through these workshops, students will be engaged in hands-on activities and field trips to semiconductor companies where they will connect their game-based learning with industry experiences. Based on students' feedback, the workshop and game curriculum will be designed and improved iteratively.<br/><br/>This Developing and Testing Innovations (DTI) project aims to help high-school students develop skills and career interests in the semiconductor fields through an innovative game-based learning platform, hands-on activities, and industry field trips. The overarching research question is: To what extent do the designs and integration of AI Educator (a generative AI tool for education), game-based learning, and hands-on experiences provide wide access and strengthen students' engagements, awareness, interests, and knowledge in STEM careers? The AI Educator will provide students with suggestions, assistance, and additional study materials about the subject matter. The AI component will be responsible for tuning the output content based on the student's interests, hobbies, and preferences to make the experience more relatable.

These structures can be used for multiple applications, including electrode materials for desalination, membranes for water treatment, solar cells, supercapacitors, batteries, and materials for carbon dioxide capture. The project aims to understand a manufacturing process in which carbon nanoparticles are attached to a scaffold and functionalized, with precise control over the porosity of the resulting structure. If successful, this research will contribute to precision manufacturing processes that will enable these advanced-material applications, which are critical to meeting requirements for future energy and water demands, and to enhance the competitiveness of the nation?s industrial base in sectors like aerospace, automotive and energy. The hands-on education and outreach activities of this project will contribute to the preparation of a diverse engineering workforce with skills specific to the needs of the wide range of industries that will depend on the technologies of these emerging areas. <br/><br/>While porous carbon structures have been manufactured for decades, it remains difficult to manufacture these structures with pre-specified porosity. The objective of this research is to address this deficiency by determining the relationship between the parameters describing the manufacturing process and the pore-size distribution of the resulting porous carbon nanostructures. This research takes a two-pronged approach: an experimental component directed at exploring the relationship between manufacturing parameters and pore-size distribution, and a theoretical component aimed at obtaining a unified interpretation of the experimental data with predictive capability. Experiments will be conducted over a range of filler morphologies, filling parameters, and etching parameters to determine the resulting pore-size distributions, with an aim of controlling porosity to within tens of nanometers. The expected result of this research will be a set of validated models explaining the impact of the manufacturing parameters on the resulting pore-size distributions, thus enabling the manufacture of the nanostructures specifically as desired, as well as tests validating the performance of the porous structures for water desalination.

Emotion understanding helps people respond to others? needs, make predictions about social interactions, and even control emotional responses. Research shows that children who are better at understanding emotions are perceived as more socially skilled by their teachers, more likable by their peers, and are better able to navigate aggressive interactions. However, it is not well understood how infants and young children learn about the emotions of others, mostly because the emotions that infants and children see in everyday life are not well understood. For decades, researchers have assumed that children learn from the stereotypic emotional expressions they see in pictures. Recent research suggests that in contrast to what was long assumed, the emotional expressions people actually make in real life do not look a lot like the stereotypes. This means that we still do not understand what input infants use to learn about emotions, and how that input informs their emotional understanding.  Thus, in order to advance the understanding of emotional learning, this project documents the emotions infants see in the real world during everyday social interactions, and how what they see translates into what they know about emotions. By characterizing the emotional input common of typically developing infants, this project aims to pave the way to better understanding of how atypical emotional environments, such as those associated with depressed, anxious, or abusive parents, shape maladaptive trajectories of emotional behavior. <br/> <br/>Project investigators plan to test infants at three different time points, at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. At each time point, researchers place a head-mounted camera on both the infants and their caregivers to record their emotional expressions during everyday interactions such as playing, feeding, and diaper changing. These video data are first used to (i) describe infants? exposure to naturalistic emotion expressions between the ages of 6 and 12 months, and (ii) describe how caregivers respond to the emotional information provided by the infants themselves (such as crying, laughing, etc.). Next, the research team assesses whether emotional information provided by caregivers (emotional facial expressions and language) predicts infants? performance on several tasks that measure what infants know about emotions. The outcome of this project is to provide insight into how naturalistic emotional information available to infants during everyday social interactions helps shape how infants learn about emotions over time. This project provides new insights into the natural input for the early development of emotion perception in infancy and lays the groundwork for research on the development of abstract emotion categories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to sustain the U.S.'s global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, there is a growing demand for a skilled semiconductor workforce. High-schoolers are among the most frequent users of electronic devices. However, many do not know how these devices are designed and manufactured. To address the knowledge gaps and workforce needs, this project will develop a semiconductor curriculum for high-school-aged students, and with partners in higher education, K-12, and industries, enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) and other innovative technologies. Game-based semiconductor modules will be created for students to play and learn with peers choosing different avatars. These learning modules will be made available to a wide range of students through industry partners. In addition, approximately 50 students each summer (years 2-4) will be engaged in in-person workshops hosted in Maine and Texas. Through these workshops, students will be engaged in hands-on activities and field trips to semiconductor companies where they will connect their game-based learning with industry experiences. Based on students' feedback, the workshop and game curriculum will be designed and improved iteratively.<br/><br/>This Developing and Testing Innovations (DTI) project aims to help high-school students develop skills and career interests in the semiconductor fields through an innovative game-based learning platform, hands-on activities, and industry field trips.

Complex analysis studies the behavior and regularity of functions defined on and taking values in spaces of complex numbers. It remains an indispensable tool across many domains in the sciences, engineering, and economics. This project considers the smoothness of transformations on a domain defined by complex valued functions when the domain is deformed. Using integral formulas, the PI will study how invariants of a domain vary when the underlying structure of the domain changes. Another component of the project involves the study of resonance. The PI will use small divisors that measure non-resonance to classify singularities of the complex structure arising in linear approximations of curved manifolds. The project will involve collaboration with researchers in an early career stage and will support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>Motivated by recent counterexamples showing that smooth families of domains may be equivalent by a discontinuous family of biholomorphisms, the PI will study the existence of families of biholomorphisms between families of domains using biholomorphism groups and other analytic tools such as Bergman metrics. The PI will construct a global homotopy formula with good estimates for suitable domains in a complex manifold. One of the goals is to construct a global formula in cases when a local homotopy formula fails to exist. The PI will use such global homotopy formulas to investigate the stability of holomorphic embeddings of domains with strongly pseudoconvex or concave boundary in a complex manifold, when the complex structure on the domains is deformed. The PI will use this approach to investigate stability of global Cauchy-Riemann structures on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of higher codimension. The project seeks a holomorphic classification of neighborhoods of embeddings of a compact complex manifold in complex manifolds via the Levi-form and curvature of the normal bundle.

For applications such as wearable and implantable biomedical sensors there is a particular need and opportunity for unobtrusive microdevices which operate autonomously as large ensembles to map physiological activity across a body area of interest. A challenge is how to construct a wireless network whereby data from a microsensor population is transmitted, received, and decoded to unravel data, say from 1000 individual sensors. A rough analogy is that of a population of common radio-frequency tags which must be read at once by a single transceiver - with the twist that signals at each sensor location will now vary both in time and in magnitude. A brain-computer interface suggests a paradigm in this context: how to capture neuronal signals at high resolution by a population of autonomous brain implanted microsensors. Ongoing research for development of brain-machine interfaces in laboratories worldwide is focused on a number of schemes where access to thousands of points in the cortex is sought to translate brain computations to useful electronic commands e.g. for intended speech. The neurotechnology problem is three-fold: to record electrical signals from the brain unobtrusively, to transmit the data wirelessly to a body external receiver, and to decipher the multitude of signals in real time. Many cases of distributed sensing of a dynamical environment are characterized by sparsity of events whether in nature or man-made systems, neurons in the brain being an example. The proposed event-driven communication strategy enables the efficient transmission, accurate retrieval, and interpretation of sparse events across a network of thousands of wireless microsensors ? using the brain as an inspiration. <br/><br/>The proposed work is focused on an all-in-one approach to build a large scale wireless microsensor radio-frequency network. An external transceiver collects data while supplying wireless power to the sensors. Each sensor is a sub-millimeter size silicon system-on-microchip with custom circuitry designed for ?event detection? where time-varying sensor inputs are encoded as a series of short ?spikes?. The brain-inspired method of encoding data from sparse events has emerged recently in so- called dynamic vision cameras. Spike train data are converted into digital form on chip and transmitted to one common receiver. Since only the event-driven spikes are transmitted through the network, the bandwidth of the communication system can be utilized very efficiently enabling a large population of sensors to be incorporated into the network.<br/>The team proposes to build a microsensor system and demonstrate low-error rate and efficient asynchronous, encoded wireless transmission in the laboratory using fabricated microchips, and to show extended applicability to thousands of nodes though simulations.<br/>Importantly, the event-sensing detection and wireless communication approach is quite suited for a neuromorphic computational approach for analyzing multisensory data; the third key element in the project. The team will show how to decode actual brain data (synthesized elsewhere from actual primate brain recordings) from a hypothetical implant composed of up to 8000 microsensors. Neuromorphic computing appears particularly suited decoding event-based data in terms of efficiency and short latency. Using available data from the primate motor cortex the team plans to show how to decode wireless signals from thousands of neurons for the prediction of planned arm and hand movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include fraud detection using online financial transaction data, optimizing marketing strategies based on analysis of real time data, etc. A new type of database system called Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) is built to perform these analytical queries over online transactional databases with low response time, but they require increasing computation resources and may still have prolonged query response time as the data continue to grow rapidly. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) techniques can significantly reduce query response time by performing random sampling in the query processing pipelines, but they are only designed for static databases that cannot be updated online. This project seeks to support scalable real-time data analytics on large and rapidly growing databases, by enabling speedy and reliable AQP capabilities in HTAP systems. The project will result in an open-source system that supports approximate real-time data analytics, and thus can potentially enable the aforementioned real-time data analytics applications. Furthermore, this project will also support the development of new educational materials on modern data management systems, include HTAP and AQP systems, as well as research training of undergraduate and graduate students, to improve the readiness of the STEM workforce. In addition, it will also support development of educational materials in data management for K-12 outreach programs and improve the public awareness of database technologies.<br/><br/>Existing HTAP systems perform exact query processing, which incurs at least linear computation cost to input size, and are no longer a viable solution as the rapid growth of data has outpaced limited increase in processor speed and storage bandwidth. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) is a fast alternative that may achieve sublinear time cost if the application can tolerate approximation, but the existing techniques suffer from several drawbacks including high data scan cost, inability to perform correct and efficient transactional updates, as well as inaccurate estimation and unreliable error diagnosis results. This project aims to resolve these drawbacks through a co-design of AQP and HTAP system components including data storage and indexing layer, transaction concurrency control protocols and approximate query processing algorithms. Specifically, this project will result in three main scientific contributions:  (1) It will develop a thread-safe, high-performance, and succinct sampling index design for HTAP storage. It will provide the necessary thread-safe atomic update and fast sampling capabilities for enabling speedy and reliable AQP in HTAP systems. (2) It will design new protocols to enforce snapshot isolation and serializability for database transactions with mixed updates and approximate queries. (3) It will also investigate a new sampling strategy leveraging the fast-sampling capabilities to minimize approximate query latency given a user-specified confidence bound target, and a background diagnosis service for reliably diagnosing estimation failures where the true answer does not fall into the estimated confidence interval with the user-specified confidence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When high-demand electronics are not available in the marketplace, they become prime targets for counterfeiters. Aside from billions of dollars lost from intellectual property (IP) infringement, counterfeit electronics are often of substandard quality, thereby creating risks for systems and infrastructure in critical sectors such as healthcare, food and agriculture, communications, transportation, energy, manufacturing, emergency services, defense, and more. Recent legislation, such as the CHIPS Act, stresses the need for procedures to combat counterfeiting, but key stakeholders have resisted adoption of the requisite technologies for years. Counterfeit detection and avoidance can be accomplished by physical inspection, electrical tests, or design-for-anti-counterfeit (DfAC). The former two have been the mainstay, but are less reliable, more expensive, and lack automation. Although DfAC primitives can only be included in brand new electronics, they are more promising with respect to accuracy, authentication cost, and scalability. Further, centralized and decentralized ledger technologies, including blockchains, are advancing to support DfAC primitive verification and for immutable traceability and provenance of electronics. This project aims to address the major barriers for DfAC primitive integration into microchips and systems. Counterfeit attestation modules (CAMOs for short) will be developed to efficiently collect DfAC outputs from all the microchips on a printed circuit board (PCB), verify that the PCB itself has not been tampered, and protect communication of results to a digital ledger for en masse authentication. In addition, lightweight DfAC primitives that can be conveniently incorporated into common microchip modules will also be explored.  Scalable, convenient, and inexpensive detection of counterfeit electronics from this project shall result in savings for commercial and defense industries that will be passed on to consumers and taxpayers.<br/><br/>The above goals will be achieved through four tasks. First, a novel circuit called Resonant Frequency Lock-On (Res-FLO) will be explored for self-contained authentication of PCBs. Res-FLO captures unique, process variation dependent signatures from PCB power distribution networks to detect cloned and tampered PCBs. Next, to support chip authentication and provide security in CAMO communication protocols, lightweight DfAC primitives will be investigated for detecting the two most prevalent counterfeit chip types ? recycled and cloned. The former will be detected by measuring degradation in analog and digital low dropout regulators (LDOs) while the latter can be achieved by adopting physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Third, inexpensive protocols that provide confidentiality and integrity for communications within the PCB and to a ledger/blockchain will be composed from elements of the first two tasks. Namely, CAMO will exploit the large input/output space, machine learning (ML) attack resistance, and multiple measurements of strong PUFs to increase the security and confidence of authentic/counterfeit classification without the need for expensive cryptographic and error correction schemes. Finally, the CAMO primitives and protocols will be taped out for proof-of-concept and to capture overheads, impacts of aging and noise, resistance to attacks, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boiling heat transfer plays a pivotal role in various industries such as aviation, space exploration, electric vehicles, and industrial heat. Despite its significance, fundamental questions persist regarding boiling heat transfer, including an understanding of unique flow patterns, temperature distributions, bubble sizes, and trajectories. These challenges arise from difficulties in modeling and visualizing temperatures. Understanding temperature distributions and driving processes is crucial for the development of next-generation thermal management systems. The outcomes of this project are expected to be pertinent to industrial applications by establishing knowledge and metrology for complex heat transfer systems. One specific area of interest is enhancing the energy efficiency of heat exchangers. Cooling for data centers (that use heat exchangers) accounts for approximately 1% of all electricity produced in the US, resulting in a cost of $34 billion and 137 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Therefore, exploring new opportunities in advanced temperature-metrology and analysis for heat exchanger performance improvements will have a tremendous impact on energy resources. Additionally, the project contributes to education through three tasks: (1) creating educational videos and exercises for machine learning modeling; (2) developing structured learning activities for K-12 and undergraduate students; and (3) collaborating with Intel Corporation to inspire students in non-academic research settings.<br/><br/>Understanding temperature changes in boiling fluids over finned surfaces is currently limited. There is a lack of understanding regarding the spatiotemporal variation of temperature field in boiling fluids over finned surface, which represent a complex fundamental mode of heat transfer. The research proposes a novel temperature visualization method that integrates laser-based diagnostic tools and advanced deep learning methods to enable the measurement in boiling fluids in complex geometries. The project hypothesizes that advances in deep learning can reconstruct temperature fields in fluids from sparse measurements and correct visualization artifacts, enabling the visualization of spatiotemporal temperature variations in boiling fluids. If successful, the proposed research can significantly advance the fundamental understanding of the following thermal transport phenomena: (1) The impact of flow-structure interaction on the temperature field, thermal boundary layer, and superheated liquid layer development, (2) The mixing behavior of the thermal boundary layer during vapor evaporation, bubble departure from the surface, and rewetting of the dry spot after microlayer evaporation, and  (3) The distribution of local heat transfer coefficients on finned surfaces at different phases of the boiling process. The improved understanding will contribute to the design of more effective finned heat exchangers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major problem is that all of these ancient rocks have experienced at least one episode of alteration, deformation and/or metamorphism. So no pristine rocks (protoliths) exist. However, many studies have used whole rock geochemistry and isotope tracers, and more recently the isotope signatures of accessory phases as important anchor points for models of how the crust has evolved and grown over time.  Various theories and processes have been proposed for the formation of Earth's earliest stable crust. The debate over interpreting these data revolves around a core inquiry: whether the deformation and metamorphism of crustal rocks alters certain geochemical markers commonly used in reconstructing crustal history. The primary goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that certain elements and isotopes in deformed (ancient) rocks accurately reflect the original geochemical signatures of their protolith. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating if the isotope signatures of whole rock and accessory minerals remain unchanged with increasing strain, and hence faithfully record the original protolithic (isotope) composition, or if deformation leads to the disturbance of isotope systems on a mineral and/or whole rock scale. Three different sequences of rocks, varying in degrees of deformation, will be studied to understand the extent to which deformation may alter their geochemical signatures on a whole rock, and (sub)-mineral-scale. These sequences range from initially undeformed (protolith) rocks to highly deformed ones, which closely resemble the world's oldest rocks. The findings of this study will help researchers use and interpret geochemical, particularly isotopic, data from deformed ancient rocks. This research will support student training, international collaboration, and continued development of analytical facilities at the Peter Hooper GeoAnalytical Lab and the Radiogenic Isotope & Geochronology Lab at Washington State University. Two PhD students (one female), as well as undergraduate students will be trained in field work and cross-disciplinary research spanning from mineralogy to structural geology to geochemistry.<br/><br/>Isotope signatures in whole rock samples and in some accessory minerals, such as zircon, apatite, allanite, and titanite, are frequently used to reconstruct the formation and evolution of the Earth?s crust. However, virtually all Archean and Proterozoic rocks have experienced one or more episodes of deformation and metamorphism following their emplacement, and it is unclear to what degree these rocks retain their original (i.e., protolithic) isotope ratios after experiencing these tectono-thermal events. This research combines a geochemical and structural approach to understand to what degree granitic rocks can be deformed without changing their protolithic geochemical fingerprint at a whole rock- and (sub-)mineral-scale. This project will focus on testing a primary hypothesis: that whole rocks and accessory minerals in variably deformed granitic rocks faithfully retain their original geochemical isotope signatures and hence can be used to reconstruct long-term crustal processes, such as the formation of Earth?s earliest stable crust.  The following key questions will be investigated: 1) what accessory minerals are involved in deformation-induced mineral reactions? 2) does deformation lead to open-system processes, and if so, how does this vary with degree of deformation? and 3) to what extent do Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd, and Rb-Sr isotope systematics in accessory minerals of variably deformed rocks faithfully preserve their initial isotope compositions? Three different field localities in which the same granitic bodies are exposed across strain gradients, spanning from undeformed to highly deformed will be studied. Via comparison of isotope data of the above systems on an accessory mineral- and whole rock-scale between deformed granitic rocks and their protoliths can be tested if deformed rocks retain their original isotope signatures on different scales (mineral vs. whole rock) or if the above isotope systems become disturbed upon deformation and hence cannot be trusted to reflect the protolithic composition. High-spatial resolution in-situ isotope and elemental analyses via EPMA and LA-(MC)-ICP-MS will be conducted on all major and accessory phases in order to gain an in-depth understanding of how minerals geochemically communicate with each other during deformation and if and to what degree trace elements are mobilized and redistributed on different scales. The results of this study will offer key understandings into how geochemical and particularly isotopic information from deformed and metamorphosed rocks can be interpreted and applied to reconstruct large-scale crustal processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project undertakes a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnon devices built upon two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. The primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and detection of magnon currents within realistic 2D structures.

Existing semiclassical models that overlook these quantum fluctuations often fall short for two-dimensional systems. The present project sets out to create novel modeling tools tailored for two-dimensional material-based spintronic devices. The objective is to assess the repercussions of spin fluctuations on spin transport properties, using experimentally observed materials as a benchmark. The specific focus is placed on a holistic theoretical approach addressing magnon conductance, spin pumping, magnon drag, and spin-charge conversion in the setting of two-dimensional heterostructures. Venturing into the granular spin models of these materials, the proposed theoretical model is to elucidate the intrinsic role of spin fluctuations in molding spintronic devices.

The leaders will guide participants in short but intense research projects in one of the many active research areas in physics and astronomy at Brigham Young University. The whole cohort is mentored from initial research prospectus to final report and intermediate presentations in addition to the one-on-one faculty mentoring. Professional preparation and skill development are complemented with informal activities for social cohesion and networking. The individual participants' projects explore a broad spectrum of currently unsolved problems through hands-on activities under a faculty mentor's direct supervision to provide significant and lasting educational and intellectual benefits to the participants. As the participants' projects are integrated into the current research program of active research groups, they are likely to contribute to the advance of knowledge and produce results that can be published and/or presented at professional meetings. Participants are immersed in an intense collaborative experiment centered around collegiality and scientific practice at a significant time in their educational development. By assembling a vast group of diverse participants from different walks of life but with a common purpose and interest in physics, the program intends to create lifelong connections and a resource network that will benefit all participants, their scientific productivity, and professional trajectory. A particular aspect of the program is the inclusion of two RET participants, typically one local. There are identical research expectations for REU and RET participants, and both groups benefit from the association.<br/><br/>The program offers experimental, computational, and theoretical projects in a wide variety of sub fields of physics. Although each student's project is unique, participants indicate that they benefit from the broader exposure to physics through the REU cohort. The areas covered include: Quantum Information and Dynamics, Semiconductor and Solar Energy Nanomaterials, Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanet Atmospheres, Coherent Lenses Imaging and Optics, Electron Microscopy and Nanofabrication, Galactic Astronomy Deep Imaging, Local Structure of Quantum Materials, Materials Structure, Properties and Symmetries, Modeling Complex Systems, Nanomagnetism, Nonlinear Acoustics, Numerical Relativity, Observational Astronomy, Particle Theory, Physics and Astronomy Education, Pulsating Star Astronomy, and Underwater Acoustics, Material Physics for Space Observation, 3D printing in Science Teaching, Active Galactic Nuclei, Computational Biophysics, Orbits of Exoplanets and Solar System Small Bodies, Acoustics and Vibration.

This cyberinfrastructure boosts the campus research network to a full 100G capacity, integrates a 100G Science DMZ for better external connections, and introduces a 100G Software Defined Networking (SDN) enabled testbed for creative research opportunities. This enhancement dramatically improves digital interaction among researchers, scientific instruments, visualization stations, high-performance computing (HPC) resources, and external collaborators, elevating research speed and enabling methodologies previously out of reach. For example, large environmental and hydrology data collected by unmanned aircrafts can now be managed through the SDN, quickly processed by HPC clusters, and shared with external collaborators for immediate machine-learning analysis. This infrastructure also benefits students, particularly those from underrepresented groups and first-generation college attendees, by providing them with hands-on experience with top-tier technology in their studies and research projects. <br/><br/>The cyberinfrastructure's modular design caters to varied research and educational requirements. The Science DMZ module, featuring a high-performance switch and a cutting-edge data transfer node, isolates research data traffic from general university operations. The on-campus research network employs a spine-leaf architecture for its scalability and reliability, consisting of two interconnected spines (64x100GbE) using 100Gb links, located in the HPC and another campus data center. The SDN-based testbed adopts a similar spine-leaf architecture with a single Spine for now, prized for its adaptability and equipped with hybrid SDN switches that have built-in controllers for innovative research exploration. Performance monitoring and adjustments are carried out with PerfSonar nodes, in a collaborative effort between researchers and network architects to ensure the cyberinfrastructure's optimal performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, many questions regarding the evolution of bipedalism remain unanswered. This CAREER project investigates the evolution of human bipedal walking and running by analyzing fossil footprints through the combined application of field, experimental and computational methods. Training and hands-on experience in paleoanthropological methods are provided to students at different education levels. A new course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), combined with individually mentored research experiences, provide students with opportunities to directly contribute to the laboratory analyses that are essential to the project. Outreach activities engage community members who live in the immediate vicinity of fossil footprint sites, through an ongoing partnership and the development of a community-led cultural heritage museum. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the Quaternary Period three fossil hominin species ? Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Paranthropus boisei were thought to have inhabited the same landscapes. The current consensus is that their cohabitation was enabled by different sets of adaptations, and that Homo erectus was the only one (and the first human ancestor) to use a modern human-like pattern of walking and running. However, the fossil data that can speak to this are limited and the interpretations inconclusive. The field excavations in this project significantly increase the volume of data available to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of human bipedalism. Through laboratory experiments, new analytical methods are developed to relate footprint morphology to foot morphology and biomechanics, allowing for detailed understandings of fossil human locomotion. The project also advances methods for finding, excavating, and analyzing fossil footprints, opening new avenues for these data to address major questions in human evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, emerging methods are removing these barriers and are allowing fungi to be studied by sequencing their DNA from individual cells without cultivation (single cell genomics). This project will focus on a group of aquatic fungi called Blastocladiomycota (blastoclads), a diverse group of fungi with unique life cycles and important ecological roles, including acting as pathogens to many insects, plants, and algae. By integrating single cell genomics and microscopic observations, this project will lead to the discovery of new species and taxonomic revision of five major blastoclad lineages, including Coelomomyces, a genus that has long been studied as a potential biocontrol agent of disease-vectoring mosquitoes. A better understanding of the biodiversity and genetics of the group and their ecological interactions can help in global preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks and development of possible biocontrol agents. This project will involve training of a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student, and will perform outreach through a workshop and a teaching module that focus on these fungi.<br/><br/>This project aims to unite historical information on a group of fungi that has been heavily studied by traditional mycological approaches (microscopy, baiting, cultivation) with more modern molecular approaches that include genomics, single cell sequencing, and metagenomics. Collecting trips in Michigan and tropical/subtropical regions will be used to bait and isolate cultures and to collect tissues and specimens of pathogenic species for single cell sequencing. Genome sequencing of 30 taxa will be used to evaluate blastoclad diversity in a phylogenetic context. Several of the blastoclad genera are greatly in need of taxonomic revision. The project will focus on these genera, using a combined approach of morphology, DNA sequencing, and host range to determine appropriate species boundaries and describe new taxa. A final goal is to use environmental DNA approaches, such as metagenomics and metabarcoding to determine the extent of cryptic diversity of blastoclads, i.e., how many species are yet to be sampled, and to identify habitats that are particularly rich in blastoclad biodiversity. Together these approaches will provide a model for future biodiversity exploration in neglected groups of fungi.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogels are soft and hydrated materials similar to our body tissues. This similarity makes them useful for creating soft machines that better interact with human bodies. Applications of soft machines include medical implants, wearable devices, and biomimetic robots. Unlike conventional machines that are assembled by rigid parts like nuts and bolts, soft machines are assembled through deformable adhesion. Although some existing studies have realized hydrogel adhesion that can reliably survive larger deformation, it is difficult to reversibly switch the adhesion on and off so that the soft machine can be repaired or reconfigured by part exchange, which is a common practice in conventional machines. This project will investigate novel adhesion mechanisms that enable the reversible assembly of soft machines. The success of the project will revolutionize the design of soft machines, which in turn will impact the development of many relevant applications. Moreover, the project will create training materials to help graduate students turn cutting-edge research findings into short, easy-to-understand videos. These videos, when shared on free online platforms, can bring the latest research to a much wider and diverse audience than is possible through traditional academic journals and seminars.<br/><br/>The project aims to realize switchable adhesions through stimuli-responsive osmocapillary and electrostatic interactions on hydrogel interfaces. While stimuli-responsive adhesion based on these mechanisms has been reported for some material-stimulus systems, the mechanics governing these mechanisms is understudied. This project will explore the underlying mechanics by (1) characterizing the adhesion under controlled thermodynamic states, thus establishing the thermodynamic constitutive relations of osmocapillary and electrostatic adhesion, (2) characterizing the adhesion with controlled bulk dissipation and performing finite element simulations to study the coupling between interfacial interactions and bulk dissipation, and (3) modeling time-dependent adhesion using established hydrogel field theories and validating the model with experiments. The outcome of the project will significantly deepen the understanding of osmocapillary and electrostatic interactions on hydrogel interfaces and will pave the way for designing reversible adhesion with customizable stimuli-responsive switching behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RFBs offer many benefits for grid applications, including ability to decouple energy and power ratings, the associated, unprecedented scalability, and the cost-effectiveness in long-duration storage. However, low solubility of the redox active species in the electrolyte have so far presented challenges. One promising approach to address this limitation is the utilization of solid charge storage (booster) materials in the tanks to reversibly reduce or oxidize dissolved species in the electrolyte via indirect redox-targeting reactions. In this way, the capacity is no longer dependent on the concentration of soluble species but rather the quantity of solids in the tanks. This concept demonstrates the promise for exploiting the unique benefits of solid- and liquid-phase redox chemistry, combining the high-energy-density of the former with the scalability and safety of the latter. Successful implementation of the research will contribute to addressing the key obstacles to widespread adoption of RFBs. This will enable greater utilization of renewable sources and reduce energy related emissions. It will provide grid resilience and flexibility by effectively managing unwanted fluctuations with decoupled energy demand and supply. The research project includes pedagogical aspects of beneficial societal impact. Its integrated, interdisciplinary nature will aid in training a diverse energy science and engineering workforce to be literate in multiple aspects of materials research. Curriculum enhancements and outreach will benefit the education of a range of undergraduate and graduate students and mentor secondary and community college students, especially those of underrepresented minority groups, toward STEM careers in the strategic area of sustainable energy.<br/><br/>This research project will provide an in-depth understanding of the nature of indirect redox targeting reactions by investigating the fundamental principles, i.e., thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and mass and charge transport. Two specific principles underpinning the approach are: (1) Metal hexacyanometallates (MHCMs) possess both coarse and fine adjustments to reduction potential (E°), which can be tuned to minimize the gap in reduction potential between mediators and boosters, (2) because the energy density of redox targeting flow batteries is set by the quantity of booster material, rather than the concentration of active materials in the electrolyte, moderate concentration of both anolyte and catholyte can be used in a compositionally symmetric electrolyte. The effects of intercalation cations on E° will be probed, and thermodynamic and kinetic information from these studies will be implemented in a computational model to provide first-principles knowledge. The resulting knowledge will also provide insights into other electrochemistry-related fields utilizing the indirect redox targeting reactions, such as water electrolysis and fuel cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tissues help to stabilize the musculoskeletal system and prevent injury from overextending a joint. Despite this critical role in bodily function, there is a limited ability to predict how ligaments and tendons deform and fail. Without this predictive ability, researchers are limited in their capacity to use computational tools to better understand the injury and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. The goal of the research supported by this Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award is to engage in fundamental research to better understand how ligaments and tendons deform and fail by examining deformations of the two components that make up the tissue: the interfascicular matrix (IFM) and the fascicles.<br/> <br/>Prior work on ligament and tendon mechanics homogenizes the IFM and fascicles into one substance. However, recent work has demonstrated that these two regions cannot be homogenized when analyzing whole tissue deformation and failure. The mechanical properties of the IFM and fascicles will be characterized using a stereo digital image correlation (DIC) analysis of mechanical tests combined with inverse finite element analysis. To maximally load the IFM during testing, patellar tendon samples will be loaded in transverse tension and shear. Deformations will be tracked using a stereo DIC setup equipped with macro lenses, which enable a 10-?m spatial resolution that can differentiate between the IFM and fascicle regions. The experimental deformation fields will then be analyzed using an inverse finite element scheme to extract the mechanical properties of the IFM and fascicles. The 3D models of the tissue samples used during mechanical characterization will be generated using a photogrammetry setup that has a spatial resolution of 10 ?m. This research will be the first to generate a set of spatially heterogeneous deformation data and material properties that differentiate between the IFM and fascicle regions. To promote broader participation in engineering, a recruitment session will be organized with the Society of Women Engineers, Out in STEM, and engineering faculty members at Lafayette College who have received training on inclusive mentorship practices.

This elementary reaction between palladium and organohalides is a key step in cross-coupling reactions. Cross-coupling reactions are a mainstay of organic synthesis. However, controlling the selectivity of cross-couplings can be problematic when organic molecules contain multiple halogens. This work will enable understanding of how conditions influence the exact pathway by which palladium reacts, and this new understanding will have implications for controlling the reaction site when multiple carbon-halogen bonds are present on a molecule. In turn, this work will facilitate development of more efficient and selective methods for organic synthesis. As part of this project, an educational program will also be developed that focuses on facilitating visualization of organic reaction mechanisms in 3D space while also providing students with practical training in molecular modeling using computational tools.<br/><br/>Sharon Neufeldt and her research team at the Montana State University are studying the mechanism of oxidative addition of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides to molecular Pd(0) species. At least two pathways are known to be relevant, and a central hypothesis of this work is that the dominant mechanism can be predicted based on palladium coordination number, ligand sterics and electronics, the structure of the organic electrophile, and other factors such as solvent polarity. Understanding these factors is expected to enable control of the mechanism, and the ability to predispose Pd toward one mechanism over the other can have broad implications for controlling chemo- and site-selectivity of cross-coupling reactions. The overall objective is divided into the following specific aims: (1) to develop a model for the influence of coordination number, substrate, ligand class, and solvent on the mechanism of oxidative addition; (2) to investigate the influence of nucleophilic coupling partner on oxidative addition; and (3) to develop new palladium(0) sources. This work will be accomplished through experimental and computational techniques including carbon kinetic isotope effect studies, reaction rate and selectivity studies, organometallic synthesis, and density functional theory calculations. This work is anticipated to improve understanding of how oxidative addition takes place in such Pd(0)/ArX systems. It will also provide a starting point for rationally engineering selectivity in cross-coupling reactions, thereby streamlining reaction optimization and improving synthesis design principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, there are few methods of making them ? and these methods typically require the use of unstable reagents that are difficult to scale. This project seeks to generate cyclopropanes with new catalytic approaches that employ safe, cheap starting materials and provide synthetic entry into substitution patterns that were previously inaccessible. These studies will also focus on developing efficient, scalable, and environmentally benign technologies that can be generally applied to the synthesis of different classes of molecules that can benefit society. The program also provides training for a diverse and dynamic team of graduate and undergraduate students, who are also passionate about outreach, recruitment, and inspiring future scientists. Among the mechanisms for inspiring the public are timely social media tutorials on current events with relevant chemistry to society.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Nagib and his research team will investigate new catalytic strategies to synthesize cyclopropanes, valuable motifs in bioactive small molecules. Cyclopropanes are most commonly synthesized via a (2+1) reaction of an alkene and a highly reactive carbene intermediate. Current approaches to generating carbenes require the use of reagents that are often unstable and specialized precursors, presenting significant barriers to their further application. This proposal aims to develop new catalytic strategies to access carbenes from more simple, safe, and abundant precursors using sustainable reagents. These efforts include the polarity reversal of electrophilic metallocarbenes, single-electron transfer events to radical intermediates, and developing more robust conditions amenable to applications such as biocatalysis and high-throughput experimentation. These processes can eventually be scaled-up more easily to allow better and cheaper access to new molecules with broad implications for medicinal, materials and agro-chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this reason, the eventual departure of children from the family home, known as the transition into an empty nest, can be difficult for couples as they learn how to step back from roles as parental caregivers and adapt to daily life as ""just"" relationship partners. Indeed, the divorce rate among couples who have recently transitioned into an empty nest may be higher today than ever. Moreover, even couples who remain together after their children's departure from the home frequently recall this transition as a challenging time that strained their emotional connection with one another. Because couples' relationship quality during mid-life can have lasting effects on their happiness, health, and well-being in later life, a better understanding of couples' ability to maintain a strong and healthy relationship during this normative transition is needed.<br/><br/>This project investigates how and why couples? relationship appraisals and day-to-day interactions change across the empty nest transition period through a longitudinal, multi-method study examining couples whose last or only child is departing the home (i.e., couples completing their transition into an empty nest) and couples whose first child is departing the home (i.e., couples just beginning the launching phase). Couples will be assessed via questionnaires and daily surveys administered both before and after their children leave the family home, for a total of five waves of data collection over a three-year period. Building on the idea that relational transitions are pivotal periods that can instigate either relationship growth or decay, this project offers new perspectives on which couples may thrive and which couples may struggle during the empty nest transition. It is proposed that although the transition into an empty nest should provide couples with more opportunities to engage in shared activities and rekindle their relationship, this period may also be characterized by sudden increases in feelings of uncertainty and ambivalence that can hinder positive interactions and increase daily conflict between partners. The extent to which couples experience the benefits versus the costs of this transition may depend on several individual, relational, and contextual factors, such as parents' experience of role loss or identity disruption during this time, the nature of the parent-child relationship, the cultural values held within the family, and the stressful life circumstances (e.g., financial hardships, caring for elderly parents) couples are facing at the time.  By identifying the conditions that foster a more successful rather than strained transition, this work not only enhances understanding of why transitional periods may be challenging for couples, but also can shed light on improving adults' quality of life as they grow older.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(2) Gut biomechanics: it has multiple muscle layers that stretch and contract synchronously to produce a diverse gut motility pattern for digestion and nutrition absorption. The complex interplay between the gut?s biochemistry and biomechanics constitutes the fundamental physiology of the gastrointestinal system. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to diverse neurological, immune, and bowel disorders. However, studying the complicated physiological inter-regulation in such a series of soft, stretchy, long, and twisting organs with a variety of motility patterns has been a long-standing challenge due to the mechanical mismatch between the biological tissue and conventional electronic components. This project seeks to fill this critical technology gap by developing a soft multisensory bioelectronic device that provides robust and intimate tissue coupling while maintaining its biochemical and biomechanical sensing function during continuous gut motion. The outcomes will be new biodata to spur our fundamental understanding of gut physiology, the interplay between serotonin dynamics and gut motility, as well as new bioelectric tools to diagnose and treat digestive and neurological disorders. This project aims to broaden the participation of young people in engineering. This will be achieved through a comprehensive education plan with a variety of engaging activities, including K-12 student and teacher summer programs on electronics and robotics, undergraduate research programs and design-focused courses, and science and art festival demonstrations.<br/>This CAREER proposal aims to integrate unconventional electronic materials and device design, innovative microfabrication methods, wireless hardware, and computational methods, to develop a new type of high-performance multisensory soft bioelectronics capable of simultaneously monitoring gut biochemical release and physical motion with minimized perturbation to the biological system.

With multimodal sensing and mechanical softness, the resulting bioelectronic device will provide robust and intimate tissue coupling while maintaining its high-performance biochemical and biomechanical sensing function during continuous gut motion at its natural state.  In the long term, the new bioelectronic tool described here will not only generate new knowledge in electrical materials and biosensing but also provide new insights into studying gut physiology and microbiota?gut?brain communication, potentially leading to new tools to diagnose and treat various neurological and digestive diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DPCs are a cytotoxic form of DNA damage that potently block replication and transcription. Despite their biological significance, DPCs are often overshadowed by other forms of damage, such as DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The development of these molecules could be useful for studying DPC formation in the test tube, in cells and possibly even organisms. Selective DPC formation would enable scientists to study how such cytotoxic lesions are repaired and determine the consequences of their formation on processes involved in genetic expression. These molecules could be especially useful in the complex environment of cells, where the formation of mixtures makes it particularly difficult to elucidate the consequences of individual chemical products. This project will provide students with broad training in several research areas, including synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and cell biology. The students that obtain training while contributing to this project, will include those from groups that have historically been underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Greenberg laboratory will focus synthetic efforts on bis-electrophiles that take advantage of the high reactivity of nitrogen mustards to rapidly alkylate DNA. However, one of the highly reactive chloroethyl groups will be replaced with a more selective electrophile that is designed to preferentially react with the side-chain amino group of lysines. In this way, the formation of monoalkylation products that account for the majority of nitrogen mustard reactivity will be disfavored. Furthermore, the selectivity of the electrophile to form DPCs over ICLs will be determined. Selective DPC formation will be tested in nucleosome core particles, as well as in cells. Preferential DPC formation compared to ICLs will be probed using various cell lines that are deficient in repair of one lesion family. For instance, it is hypothesized that cells lacking SPRTN, a protease that initiates DPC repair, will be hypersensitive to the molecules. Selective DPC formation in cells that lack SPRTN would enable the exploration of alternative DPC repair systems. Studies with these bis-electrophiles may provide the foundation for the discovery of therapeutic agents that act by forming DPCs in targeted cellular loci.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, metamaterial systems have been able to deliver unique properties that can largely surpass traditional materials, but these properties are limited to very narrow ranges of operating frequencies and functionalities, which in turns limit their practical application. The nonlocal approach will help overcome substantial obstacles on the way to transition elastic metamaterial technology towards real world applications.  From a broader perspective, the theoretical and computational design tools developed in this project can have far-reaching impacts in other fields and applications such as the design of civil infrastructures resilient against extreme events, acoustic insulation for noise control in buildings and transportation systems, and advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials for electronic devices, telecommunications, and defense systems. <br/><br/>The concept hinges on an intentionally nonlocal and hierarchical design that, by exploiting nonlocal interactions across spatial scales, will enable materials with exceptionally broadband dynamic performance, tunable effective properties, and programmable dynamics. The integration of nonlocality within a hierarchical design framework leads to the concept of multiscale nonlocality that will serve as a foundational theoretical principle to engineer complex material behavior across scales and to achieve a level of control on effective material properties not achievable by operating at a single scale. This project will also introduce the distinctive concept of delocalized action as a means to achieve efficient material tuning and reconfiguration. While delocalization is a natural consequence of nonlocality, its use to control material properties is largely unexplored and opens an extremely flexible and customizable design space where the material is designed in a distributed sense, hence paving the way towards materials exhibiting extreme structural efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AD occurs in more than 35% of individuals over the age of 85 and is the fifth leading cause of death among Americans over the age of 65, with a resulting societal cost of more than $340 billion per year. Over the past years, numerous studies have highlighted that there are likely different forms of AD and AD-related dementia in the context of genetics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical pathways.  Different processes and molecular pathways can lead to many clinical and physiological subtypes of AD. This may help to explain numerous (failed) clinical trials which have usually targeted the well-known amyloid pathways and genes. To develop newer, more effective, and safer treatments, multiple new clinical targets for AD treatment are needed to increase probabilities of success. The need to identify such multiple processes/pathways underlying specific AD subtypes is crucial. Discovering these will allow the development of targeted diagnosis and treatment that is adapted and personalized to particular AD forms. The investigators in this multifaceted project will leverage the availability of genetic, protein and brain imaging data obtained from diverse populations to develop a mathematical foundation and protocol for identifying AD subtypes and potential drug targets tailored to these subtypes. The findings will be valuable to the medical community and will contribute to further understanding of the many different forms of AD and to advancing precision medicine approaches. The investigators are also committed to training, developing and nurturing students' expertise in these areas, providing them with valuable learning opportunities. <br/>	<br/>The increasing utilization and analysis of extensive datasets, particularly in medical and biological domains, underscores the need for advanced and precise data analysis methods. In these contexts, Machine Learning (ML)-based statistical inference is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of computational value addition. However, while much attention has been devoted to refining ML algorithms, the significance of feature engineering has been somewhat overlooked. Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing a novel mathematical framework for feature construction. The key insight is to treat data as realizations of a random field in a suitable Bochner function space. By constructing a new coordinate system, the investigators can unveil well-defined patterns that can significantly enhance the accuracy of existing ML algorithms. The objectives of this project include: (I) Developing a mathematical theory and protocol for constructing innovative features to better discriminate underlying stochastic behaviors of input data, employing multilevel spaces and the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion for Bochner spaces. (II) Analyzing and optimizing the parameters of such multilevel feature constructions to markedly enhance the performance of ML algorithms, especially when dealing with complex and challenging inputs.

However, the advent of new theories has reshaped our perspective on it and enabled novel engineering approaches to utilize dissipation as an important resource for manipulating the behaviors of a given system. Despite its rapid advancements in photonic and electronic circuits, dissipation engineering remains primarily a theoretical pursuit in magnonic and hybrid magnonic systems where information is carried by magnons ? the elementary collective spin excitations. In particular, the experimental exploration of unique dissipation phenomena intertwined with nonreciprocity, such as robust mode conversion and the non-Hermitian skin effect, is still in its infancy, lacking well-designed experiments and a clear path toward practical applications. This project will investigate the basic principles of dissipations in magnonic systems and engineering approaches for manipulating dissipations. These endeavors will greatly enhance the fundamental comprehension of how dissipation functions within magnonic systems, leading to advancements in practical applications such as nonreciprocal information processing. The project will provide extensive mentoring and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and moreover, a new course curriculum will be introduced for undergraduate students, creating new opportunities for underrepresented high school student groups and K-12 students to immerse themselves in science and participate in research.<br/><br/>This project aims to harness nonreciprocity by leveraging dissipation engineering in hybrid magnonic systems. Through theory-guided experimental efforts, strongly coupled microwave photon-magnon systems will be explored in three parallel thrusts: Thrust 1 will focus on the proof-of-principle demonstration of mode conversion between two magnon modes in hybrid magnonic systems, which is protected by the topology of the system and thus highly robust. This will be achieved in the time domain using pulsed operations. Thrust 2 will investigate the topological mode conversion between a magnon and a microwave photon mode, which will be implemented in the space domain under continuous wave operation. Thrust 3 will demonstrate the emergence of the skin effect in a hybrid magnonic system that is enabled by dissipative coupling. This research will provide insights for a series of fundamental questions related to the dissipation of magnetic systems, the dynamics of encircling singularity points, the relation between the non-Hermitian skin effect and nonreciprocal transport, and the role of the nonlinearities that are naturally built in the magnetization dynamics. The research outcome will pave the way for leveraging the unique non-Hermitian properties of hybrid magnonics across various applications, ranging from neuromorphic computing to magnon-based logic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various research-based approaches for improving the course often encounter local challenges that limit their adoption or implementation. This project will potentially demonstrate that technology and automated tools can effectively manage or mitigate these challenges.

This CAREER award aims to expand our theoretical understanding of this process and refine existing computational accounts, by investigating how listeners flexibly adapt their inferences and expectations in different contexts. For example, how do adults adapt their expectations when speaking with a child rather than with another adult or when speaking with other adults with different accents? Results of this work will advance knowledge of the cognitive processes that enable human communication and may have important implications for the development of technologies that support human-to-human or human-to-AI conversations.

Two possible mechanisms are that listeners track correlations in the environment or that they deploy and update a causal model of the speaker and transmission process. A series of eye-tracking experiments, paired with computational simulations, will capture the inferences that listeners make ?on the fly,? when listening to speech. How listeners learn and adjust their representations to the context will be probed by varying the nature and quantity of errors and noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will combine macroscopic-scale studies of actual catalysts with atomic-scale studies of single-crystal models. The novel catalysts consist of two different metals, isolated as single atoms, on a third metal, a composition referred to as ?trimetallic single-atom alloys.? Prior studies with bimetallic single-atom alloys, e.g., two metals, have shown that the isolated atoms drive uniquely efficient and selective catalysis of many important chemical transformations. By adding a third metal, Eagan and Sykes aim to perform more challenging chemistries, such as carbon-carbon coupling reactions crucial to a wide range of chemical syntheses. Dr. Eagan and his students will synthesize trimetallic single-atom alloy catalysts, characterize their structures using a wide range of analytical techniques, and examine their catalytic behaviors in laboratory-scale chemical reactors. Dr. Sykes and his students will synthesize the single-crystal models and investigate them using ultra-high vacuum techniques to probe structures at the atomistic level and correlate them with catalytic properties. This project aims to provide fundamental new knowledge from which a wide range of trimetallic single-atom alloys could be produced and implemented in catalyst syntheses. This project will also support efforts to connect the chemistry and chemical engineering disciplines at both the K-12 and university levels through the development of nanoscience activities and university courses.<br/><br/>Trimetallic single-atom alloys are designed to leverage the unique chemistries exhibited by distinct isolated metal atoms embedded within low-reactivity, high-selectivity coinage metal hosts in tandem catalysis on a single catalytic surface. These systems balance the diverse needs of complex surface reactions which possess elementary steps with vastly differing catalytic requirements, as is the case for many carbon-carbon coupling reactions. Eagan and Sykes will investigate mechanisms by which spillover of chemical intermediates between distinct dopant atoms enables them to cooperatively act on different parts of a catalytic cycle and drive a wider range of chemistries than would be available from bimetallic single-atom alloys. Surface science studies performed by Sykes will provide details of the geometric and electronic structures of these materials with atomic resolution as well as quantification of the kinetics of elementary reaction steps. Eagan will bridge these studies to more industrially relevant conditions in catalytic reactors through microkinetic modeling and reactor studies with catalysts synthesized using well-controlled colloidal methods. Understanding the dynamic structures of these materials in the two environments, and situations in which they do and do not affect each other, are embedded targets of these studies. This collaborative work aims to understand and bridge the materials, pressure, and temperature gaps that exist between our surface science and catalytic reactor approaches thereby generating fundamental new insights and methodologies to advance the development of this novel class of trimetallic single-atom alloy catalysts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Endothelial cells and macrophages work together in many biological processes, one of which is angiogenesis, the creation of blood vessels. Angiogenesis is critical for the healing of damaged tissues as in the case of chronic wounds. Chronic wounds last on average twelve months and may lead to amputation of lower limbs or possibly even death. Human clinical trials have shown that low-frequency, low-intensity ultrasound advances chronic wound healing. However, the biological mechanisms are still not understood. The knowledge gained from understanding how ultrasound affects endothelial cells and macrophages individually and together may enhance ultrasound therapies for advanced healing and ultimately increase the quality of life for patients. This award will also promote undergraduate and high school student exposure and training in tissue engineering, particularly for underrepresented students and women in engineering through hands-on laboratory experiences. Formal course offerings in tissue engineering will also be developed for both engineering and non-engineering majors with a focus on minoritized students and women in engineering. <br/><br/>The research goal is to evaluate the promotion of angiogenesis as a possible biological mechanism of therapeutic ultrasound. This will be achieved through two objectives: (1) characterize uni- and bi-directional effects of low-frequency, low-intensity ultrasound on macrophage and endothelial cell pro-angiogenic factors via macrophage and endothelial direct co-culture, indirect co-culture (transwell), and individually (endothelial alone and macrophage alone) and (2) analyze gene expression changes using bulk RNAseq and global bioinformation methods. These objectives will be conducted in vitro using 3D collagen scaffolds to more closely mimic physiological conditions. Understanding the effects of therapeutic ultrasound on angiogenesis will provide insight to the possible biological mechanisms of ultrasound. Preliminary data and published literature strongly suggest that stimulation of angiogenesis may be the mechanism through which ultrasound mediates healing. If this is confirmed by the data collected, this may indicate that ultrasound could be an effective therapy to recover functional endothelial behavior where pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of diseases including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases. These data would provide insights into novel therapeutic applications of ultrasound.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its global market is projected to reach 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. With the rising popularity of 360-degree videos, network operators and service providers are increasingly keen on gaining insights into users? Quality of Experience (QoE) perception. However, the conventional QoE models designed for 2D videos fall short of capturing users? unique subjective feelings in viewing this new type of video. To bridge this gap, the project focuses on constructing human-centered models that utilize ?human factors? via a variety of virtual reality (VR) onboard sensors. Leveraging multi-modal sensory readings, the researchers will tap into a direct representation of users? perceptual experiences. This approach captures subjective feelings often missed by the objective system parameters commonly used in existing QoE models. The success of this project will provide an in-depth understanding of users? nuanced perceptual experience while engaging with 360-degree videos. It will create opportunities for stakeholders to implement user-specific network resource optimization and video streaming strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction on an individual basis. The research outcomes will significantly contribute to the human-centered sensing and networking research communities and benefit numerous VR applications beyond 360-degree videos.<br/><br/>This project involves three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust investigates how to extract salient features from multi-modal sensory readings for effective QoE assessment. To combat bias arising from datasets with unevenly distributed labels, novel approaches will be developed to augment underrepresented data by exploring useful information across sensing modalities. The second thrust seeks to optimize system resource utilization for QoE assessment. Multiple personalized models will share common neural network layers at edge servers for resource-efficient model hosting. Adaptive sampling will be applied at VR terminals during sensory data acquisition to maintain data utility. The third thrust focuses on devising data privacy protection mechanisms without sacrificing QoE assessment accuracy. Under the differential privacy framework, the approach features formal quantification of data correlation of multi-modality sensory data, which has been largely overlooked by prior work. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans data-driven modeling, sensing, and privacy-preserving computing.

This is difficult to assess because faults cannot be directly observed at depths where earthquakes start, typically 5 to 15 miles below ground. We must rely instead on indirect measurements made by instruments at the Earth's surface, and computer models representing the fault and how it slips in response to pressures deep in the Earth. Properties of the virtual fault and surrounding rock can be repeatedly adjusted until the model outputs data that closely match real-world observations from seismometers and other instruments. This process is slow and expensive, even when scientists use clever strategies. Dr. Erickson and her group will see whether a new artificial intelligence scheme called a ""Physics-Informed Neural Network"" (PINN) can learn how to efficiently adjust fault model properties to rapidly fit observational data. They will test their PINN first on data from laboratory fault experiments to see how it performs at estimating the already-known fault properties, and then train it until it learns to do this well. Then they will apply the PINN to data from the Pacific Northwest and Costa Rica, where properties and physics of dangerous offshore faults need to be better understood. In addition to their main project, Erickson's team will lead short courses on modern computer programming, data analysis, and AI methods for community college students, using datasets and techniques from this project.<br/><br/>Dr. Erickson and her group will apply a deep learning learning technique called the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to study fault slip, using synthetic and laboratory data, as well as geodetic and seismic data from the Cascadia and Costa Rica subduction zones.

RFBs offer many benefits for grid applications, including ability to decouple energy and power ratings, the associated, unprecedented scalability, and the cost-effectiveness in long-duration storage. However, low solubility of the redox active species in the electrolyte have so far presented challenges. One promising approach to address this limitation is the utilization of solid charge storage (booster) materials in the tanks to reversibly reduce or oxidize dissolved species in the electrolyte via indirect redox-targeting reactions. In this way, the capacity is no longer dependent on the concentration of soluble species but rather the quantity of solids in the tanks. This concept demonstrates the promise for exploiting the unique benefits of solid- and liquid-phase redox chemistry, combining the high-energy-density of the former with the scalability and safety of the latter. Successful implementation of the research will contribute to addressing the key obstacles to widespread adoption of RFBs. This will enable greater utilization of renewable sources and reduce energy related emissions. It will provide grid resilience and flexibility by effectively managing unwanted fluctuations with decoupled energy demand and supply. The research project includes pedagogical aspects of beneficial societal impact. Its integrated, interdisciplinary nature will aid in training a diverse energy science and engineering workforce to be literate in multiple aspects of materials research. Curriculum enhancements and outreach will benefit the education of a range of undergraduate and graduate students and mentor secondary and community college students, especially those of underrepresented minority groups, toward STEM careers in the strategic area of sustainable energy.<br/><br/>This research project will provide an in-depth understanding of the nature of indirect redox targeting reactions by investigating the fundamental principles, i.e., thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and mass and charge transport. Two specific principles underpinning the approach are: (1) Metal hexacyanometallates (MHCMs) possess both coarse and fine adjustments to reduction potential (E°), which can be tuned to minimize the gap in reduction potential between mediators and boosters, (2) because the energy density of redox targeting flow batteries is set by the quantity of booster material, rather than the concentration of active materials in the electrolyte, moderate concentration of both anolyte and catholyte can be used in a compositionally symmetric electrolyte. The effects of intercalation cations on E° will be probed, and thermodynamic and kinetic information from these studies will be implemented in a computational model to provide first-principles knowledge. The resulting knowledge will also provide insights into other electrochemistry-related fields utilizing the indirect redox targeting reactions, such as water electrolysis and fuel cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such societies are found in a wide variety of animals including ants, bees, wasps, birds, and mammals (including traditional human societies). What is particularly poorly understood is why breeding individuals tolerate non-breeders in their social groups when they are not helpers. This project focuses on this question using clown anemonefish as a model. The project involves a combination of laboratory experiments, field experiments, and molecular genetics to test several hypotheses about the potential benefits to the breeding pair of living in a larger group. The clown anemonefish has become a model system for investigations of social systems due to its tractability in the laboratory and in the field thus this study will inform our understanding of similar social groups which are much less experimentally tractable. The research objectives are integrated with multiple broader impact activities. Undergraduates and graduate students will be trained in various transferable skills, such as experimental design, data collection, data management, statistical modeling, and scientific communication while also learning about animal behavior.  High school students will be hosted as project interns and will participate in all aspects of the scientific process. In addition, a proposed book, targeted at a teenage audience, will present animal behavior research and profile animal behavior researchers to improve the general public?s understanding of this field. <br/><br/>Animal societies are one of the most remarkable products of evolution, and they have been a focus for tests of evolutionary theory ever since Darwin pointed out the difficulties that some features of societies (e.g., non-breeding and helping strategies) posed for the theory of natural selection. To fully understand these societies, it must be understood both why non-breeders tolerate their situation and why breeders tolerate non-breeders. Frequently, breeders tolerate non-breeders because they help provision offspring or the breeders themselves, but in some canonical vertebrate societies the benefits that breeders accrue from non-breeders are not obvious. The overarching objective of this proposal is to resolve this paradox, investigating why breeders tolerate non-breeders in the clown anemonefish (Amphiprion percula), which has emerged as a model system for marine science. The project will evaluate support for three alternative hypotheses for why breeders will tolerate non-breeders, 1) as a bet-hedging strategy against partner loss; 2) that they provide weak kin-selected benefits; and 3) that they provide mutualist (anemone)-mediated benefits. The project will combine long-term field experiments and laboratory experiments to evaluate these alternatives. In sum, the proposed research will investigate why breeders tolerate non-breeders in societies where the benefits that breeders accrue from non-breeders are hidden, providing new insights into social evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rural communities are hindered by limited infrastructure, vast distances, rugged terrain and severe weather conditions, which significantly impact the timely and efficient delivery of essential healthcare supplies. Despite the recognized potential of drones to enhance healthcare delivery in such settings, optimizing drone operations considering practical constraints such as environmental factors (e.g., weather and wind conditions) and their impact on operational performance (e.g., range and payload) has proven challenging. This award addresses this need by developing and analyzing mathematical models to support drone integration into multi-modal transportation networks, considering the uncertainties of weather conditions and the specific needs of each delivery. This initiative aims not only to enhance healthcare access in rural areas but also to advance the state of the art in healthcare logistics, contribute to educational and diversity efforts in STEM, and ultimately support the national health and prosperity by ensuring efficient and equitable healthcare access across all communities.<br/><br/>This research will develop a decision-support tool for improving rural healthcare logistics through strategic drone use given variable weather and operational conditions. Probabilistic energy consumption modeling will allow the incorporation of uncertainties in drone performance into a robust optimization model that designs the logistic network under worst-case scenarios while also optimizing reliable operations to facilitate collaboration among multiple transportation modes, including drones.

This project focuses on near-future scenarios that require complex long-horizon reasoning with non-trivial constraints on the robot's motion. Examples include a robot operating in a warehouse with a partly automated storage and retrieval system or a robot running experiments in an automated laboratory. Several methods in robotics address the challenges of the above scenarios with explicit and carefully crafted planning domains that model how the robot interacts with the environment. Planning domains provide an abstraction over the world that is essential for Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) methods that plan over long horizons, that is, compute executable complex plans that require many steps or have non-monotonic properties, such as rearranging objects on shelves or fetching reactants for an experiment. This research project is working to develop interpretable TAMP methods with the capability to deal with increasing uncertainty in the environment, while not sacrificing their strengths and providing a structured framework that allows for a meaningful connection with emerging model-free approaches. The project's novelties lie precisely in the development of methodologies that allow the augmentation of TAMP methods with the capability to reason about uncertainty and implicit models. The project's impact is in building the foundations that will enable robots to perform complex tasks such as cleaning a house, helping doctors and nurses, assisting elderly persons, and even performing science-related tasks in the far-off reaches of space. The team is training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, and pursuing outreach activities including participation to CRA-WP programs.  <br/><br/>On a technical front, the project supports three aims. The first aim addresses noise in the sensing and actuation of the robot. Factor graphs will be enhanced in a way that allows exploiting inherent structure in long-horizon planning problems to make planning under uncertainty efficient, and loosen assumptions to, e.g., allow efficient use of learned actions. The second aim goes further to consider pathological uncertainty: when there is so little information that there is effectively a gap in the plan. Plans are dynamically modified at execution time to fill these gaps leveraging, among others, learned skills to close gaps. The third aim focuses on augmenting TAMP methods with another source of unknown and difficult-to-model information: human preferences and critiques. The project addresses how implicit and learned representations can be used and accumulated over a system's lifetime. Importantly, the work can fit with any high-level planner, including Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers and large language models leveraging advances in these domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these infections are triggered by virulence proteins secreted from bacteria in lipid-containing particles, called extracellular vesicles. Human waste (feces) is an important source of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs)   in the environment. However, little is known about the fate of BEVs when they enter wastewater treatment and disposal systems. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to investigate the fate and health impacts of BEVs in wastewater systems. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to combine and integrate the extraction and separation of BEVs from wastewater samples with advanced proteogenomic analyses to identify and quantify BEV proteins in wastewater. The PI will then utilize this new approach to investigate the generation, fate, and persistence of BEVs in wastewater and wastewater treatment systems. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge on the fate of BEVs in the environment and their potential impacts on public health. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student and one undergraduate student at the University at Buffalo.<br/><br/>Bacteria release extracellular vehicles as a universal pathway to export their cellular contents (i.e., proteins, nucleotides, lipids, and metabolites) with enriched concentrations into the surrounding environment. Previous studies have shown that certain bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) introduced through a respiratory or oral route can lead to inflammatory reactions in vivo and in vitro. Those disease-causing functions and interactions with host cells are primarily attributed to virulence proteins released by BEVs. High concentrations of BEVs and EV-producing bacteria are shed in human waste (feces) and are likely to enter wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal systems. However, limited fundamental knowledge is available about the virulence proteins carried by bacterial EVs in wastewater due to the challenges of protein analysis in complex wastewater and environmental matrices. This CAREER project will investigate the persistence and production of BEVs in wastewater and assess their potential risks to human health with the goal of improving disinfection strategies to deactivate BEVs and advancing the discovery of health-relevant biomarkers from wastewater. The specific objectives of the research are to (1) develop and apply a novel integrated separation and proteogenomic approach to characterize BEV proteins and their biological functions in municipal wastewater; (2) measure the kinetics of BEV production, partitioning, and decay in wastewater; and (3) assess the disease-causing potentials of BEVs after treatment by commonly used disinfection methods including chlorination and germicidal UV. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge to advance the detection, discovery, and monitoring of virulence proteins released by BEVs in wastewater and environmental media. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will leverage existing programs and resources at the University at Buffalo (UB) to (1) develop and display interactive activities simulating wastewater microbiome discovery for the general public at the Buffalo Museum of Science and (2) design LEGO platforms to broaden the engagement of K-12 students in learning about omics technologies and their utilization in environmental monitoring and disease surveillance. In addition, the PI  plans to leverage the research findings to design and incorporate lessons in omics tools and analyses into the Environmental Engineering Curriculum at UB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The global market for immersive video is projected to reach 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. With the rising popularity of 360-degree videos, network operators and service providers are increasingly keen on gaining insights into users? Quality of Experience (QoE) perception. However, the conventional QoE models designed for two dimensional videos fall short of capturing users? unique subjective feelings in viewing this new type of video. To bridge this gap, the project focuses on constructing human-centered models that utilize ?human factors? via a variety of virtual reality (VR) onboard sensors. Leveraging multi-modal sensory readings, the researchers will tap into a direct representation of users? perceptual experiences. This approach captures subjective feelings often missed by the objective system parameters commonly used in existing QoE models. The success of this project will provide an in-depth understanding of users? nuanced perceptual experience while engaging with 360-degree videos. It will create opportunities for stakeholders to implement user-specific network resource optimization and video streaming strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction on an individual basis. The research outcomes will significantly contribute to the human-centered sensing and networking research communities and benefit numerous VR applications beyond 360-degree videos.<br/><br/>This project involves three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust investigates how to extract salient features from multi-modal sensory readings for effective QoE assessment. To combat bias arising from datasets with unevenly distributed labels, novel approaches will be developed to augment underrepresented data by exploring useful information across sensing modalities. The second thrust seeks to optimize system resource utilization for QoE assessment. Multiple personalized models will share common neural network layers at edge servers for resource-efficient model hosting. Adaptive sampling will be applied at VR terminals during sensory data acquisition to maintain data utility. The third thrust focuses on devising data privacy protection mechanisms without sacrificing QoE assessment accuracy. Under the differential privacy framework, the approach features formal quantification of data correlation of multi-modality sensory data, which has been largely overlooked by prior work. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans data-driven modeling, sensing, and privacy-preserving computing. The proposed mechanisms and designs will be thoroughly evaluated via a combination of measurement campaigns, simulations, and experimental studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biomarkers, or biological markers, are measurable indicators of a biological cell state or condition and can be closely associated with changes in functionality and health of cells. Thus, the ability to measure multiple cell mechanical properties as biomarkers will benefit biological research and clinical applications such as cancer studies, drug screening/discovery, and immunology. The acoustic sensing concept in this project relies on the detection of exceptional points, which are highly sensitive dynamic states that occur in non-Hermitian physical systems characterized by balanced gain and loss. The long-term research goal of the project is to employ the sensing scheme for measuring mechanical biomarkers of individual cells in high throughput for both fundamental studies and clinical applications. The research findings will also contribute to the PIs? long-term education and outreach goals of motivating students toward science and engineering, by illustrating far reaching implications of engineering. The project activities will also specifically illustrate how engineers contribute to biomedicine through acoustic sensing and fundamental wave mechanics concepts. Results from this research will benefit the US health and society, impacting the fields of acoustic sensing, disease diagnosis, and cellular biology.<br/><br/>The project will investigate fundamental research questions related to how biological cells with different mechanical properties (stiffness, density, compressibility and viscosity) interact with acoustic waves propagating along a substrate, how perturbations caused by the cell and by changes in its properties can break the dynamic equilibrium associated with exceptional points, and how the corresponding frequency splitting mechanism can quantify changes in the cell properties and thus form the basis for a novel acoustic biosensing technique. The project objectives will be accomplished through two research tasks: (1) investigation of cell-wave interaction and fundamental studies on exceptional point generation in acoustic substrates; and (2) experimental investigations, and proof-of-concept of exceptional point-based acoustic biosensing. This project will lead to advances in the understanding of the interaction between surface acoustic waves and a cell. The study of exceptional points generation in surface acoustic waves substrates with a cavity is a novel aspect of the work, which will explore the interaction of multiple wave modes with cavity-cell resonances, their coupling and hybridization.

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research on trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies to transform behavioral modeling in weather and climate disasters and advances STEM education and emergency management practices. Such theory-informed, high-resolution models are explainable, and bias in them is minimized in support of time- and safety-critical decisions. The project contributes to training of the next-generation scientists and engineers to build and utilize cutting-edge AI tools for disaster management. <br/><br/>Research on harnessing AI to enhance human behavioral modeling in disasters is emerging but still in its infancy. Notably, many of the current models function as a black box and have not thoroughly considered critical issues such as trustworthiness, bias, and fairness. This project fills the knowledge gap by developing an integrated trustworthy AI research and education framework. Five main tasks are pursued: 1) Coupling fundamental theories with data-driven AI approaches to improve the prediction of human behaviors in weather and climate disasters; 2) characterizing fairness issues present in AI-based behavioral models, and reducing inherent bias and inequity; 3) interpreting model inputs and outputs to gain unique insights and advance theories; 4) transferring research outcomes into high school and undergraduate engineering curricula; and 5) providing training opportunities to emergency managers and transportation professionals to enhance their technological competency. Collectively, this CAREEER project has the potential to yield significant improvement to emergency management, social equity, and community resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this practice,  one or more peers inspect and approve a code change before integrating it into a project's repository. As developers spend significant effort daily on CR tasks, improving CR effectiveness is a high priority for these organizations. Challenges limiting CR effectiveness include i) code learning difficulties with limited time and code context, ii) misunderstandings among the participants over confusing suggestions,  and iii) interpersonal conflicts due to disrespectful feedback. In the short term, these challenges increase required efforts, delay the outcomes, increase the likelihood of rejections, and frustrate the participants. In the long term, these challenges degrade software quality, cause conflicts among the participants, demotivate an inappropriately written review's target, pose barriers to newcomers' onboarding,  disproportionately impact minorities,  and even cause long-term developers to leave permanently. Despite several studies confirming these short and long-term consequences, practical solutions to these challenges remain nonexistent.  The project will work to improve code reviews using empirical methods, machine learning and natural language techniques to produce tools to be used in code reviews. The new knowledge and tools will be used as an educational platform that will support students and new programmers. The project will integrate the research into education by using the tools in classes and curriculum development, using the classroom setting to gain understanding of how to support developers in professional code-review ecosystems. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to transform code review tools and workflows to address participants' challenges in understanding the code under review and communicate that understanding with others in unambiguous and constructive languages. This project will empirically develop a theoretical framework for each of the three aforementioned CR challenges to characterize the root causes and potential mitigating solutions. The experimental platform will transform CR tools into an online learning environments that integrate additional cognitive support tools to support unmet or partially met information needs and just-in-time coaching to assist CR participants in communicating unambiguously and constructively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A hallmark of such collectives is coordination among individuals, which is critical to processes as diverse as pathogen clearance by populations of immune cells, coordinated development of a tissue, and swift but accurate decision-making by animal groups. However, coordination is not the only behavior collectives exhibit. They can also, at times, be dominated by disorder and systemic dysfunction. Examples include the hyperactive immune responses behind autoimmunity and uncontrolled misinformation cascades in animal groups. The goal of this project is to answer a question that has eluded scientists for decades: how and why do biological collectives coordinate seamlessly in some situations, yet exhibit catastrophic dysfunction in others? The project will answer this question by combining elegant experiments with mathematical and computational models that seek to identify the factors contributing to this variation. This project will contribute to the empirical and theoretical foundations for solving diverse problems ranging from the control of distributed robots and sensor networks to health interventions aimed at promoting wound healing or disrupting collective behaviors of pathogens. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind collective dysfunction may also provide insights into topics as diverse as the conservation of animal migrations, management of population and ecosystem dynamics, and the neural mechanisms that underlie functional and dysfunctional social behavior. Education and broader impact activities will focus on strengthening mathematical and AI literacy among life science students at undergraduate and graduate levels and sharing scientific knowledge beyond academia by engaging with natural history educators, science curriculum developers, and teachers.<br/><br/>This project seeks to reveal core scientific principles that govern why biological collectives function effectively under some circumstances, yet exhibit catastrophic dysfunction under others. The project will involve a strong feedback between theory development and experimentation with schooling fish ? an iconic model of biological collectives. Using novel closed-loop experimental systems and AI-driven computer vision tools, the project will study how collectives solve ecologically-relevant tasks (e.g., predator evasion, decision-making, foraging) within precisely-controlled laboratory environments. The project seeks to achieve three aims. Aim 1 focuses on how individuals cope with conflicting demands that arise when making decisions within a group. Aim 2 focuses on a critical issue that arises when individuals learn from one another: how to cope with misinformation. Aim 3 focuses on a widely-documented phenomenon known as behavioral lock-in, wherein individuals in a group over-rely on information from others to the point of becoming unresponsive to the environment. The project will advance scientific knowledge by (i) identifying general mechanisms of function and dysfunction in biological collectives, (ii) discovering mechanistic links between individual phenotype, collective phenotype, and fitness-relevant outcomes, (iii) generating quantitative hypotheses about the neural basis of collective behavior, and (iv) developing general theoretical models of collective behavior that are strongly rooted in data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will examine the 'Tragedy of the Commons (ToC)'? a situation where AVs, while smart on their own, might cause significant traffic oscillation and disorder when they all use the same logic. The research will also examine human-like 'Emergent Cooperative Behavior (ECB)' in complex traffic situations, aiming to incorporate such cooperative driving behaviors into AV control systems and hoping to achieve efficient operation in multi-agent systems. This project could lead to cutting-edge advancements in collaborative control and management in various traffic environments with AVs, which is crucial as they become more common on our streets. Moreover, insights gained from understanding the 'Tragedy of the Commons' and 'Emergent Cooperative Behavior' in AVs could apply to a broader range of multi-agent systems, potentially influencing fields as varied as financial market algorithms or robotics.

The hypothesis that AV control exhibits the ToC such that a stream of AVs may have inferior performance (e.g., causing traffic breakdown) even when an individual AV performs superior (e.g., with less instability) will first be tested. The counterpart of the hypothesis is that human-driven vehicle (HV) behavior manifests the ECB such that while an individual HV may not perform as well, a stream of HVs may maintain reasonable performance even in adverse conditions. This hypothesis will be tested by investigating the Markovian and uniformity properties of AVs and HVs. The Markovian property indicates that the vehicle action is determined by the current traffic state independent of its previous experience, while uniformity implies that vehicles follow a similar behavior rule regardless of the traffic environment. The conjecture that AVs have these properties while HVs do not will be evaluated using field data. How these properties would lead to TOC for AVs yet ECB for HVs with the be examined using analytical modeling and simulation. The finding of these fundamental properties will be used to construct a meta-learning-based AV control approach applicable to both US and Indian intersections, with the intention of reversing the ToC phenomenon for existing AVs and cultivating new AV control using an ECB system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Originating in response to global disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain vulnerabilities, and geopolitical conflicts, the project holds significant importance. Focusing on Ukraine's digital services sector, which has faced persistent external shocks due to the ongoing conflict, this initiative is both timely and crucial. The primary objective is to establish connections between Ukrainian scientists and their counterparts in the West, mitigating the isolation caused by geopolitical tensions and fostering a collaborative research network dedicated to systemic resilience. Involving an international partnership comprising the USA, Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania, the project adopts an interdisciplinary approach, leveraging network science, resilience analytics, explainable AI, and digital twin technologies. Beyond enhancing Ukraine's infrastructural resilience, the project aspires to serve as a blueprint for global resilience strategies in analogous contexts.<br/>To achieve broader impact, the Dallas-Fort Worth airport will function as the initial RRUA testbed for co-development and training.

In addition to advancing research goals, this project is steadfast in its commitment to promoting inclusivity in science and engineering. It actively involves junior Ukrainian researchers, facilitating their integration into the global scientific community. Educational opportunities will be offered through digital platforms, workshops, and simulation games, aligning with EU-Ukraine events. These initiatives aim to provide a distinctive learning experience, nurturing a new generation of scientists equipped with the skills to address complex resilience challenges and aligning with the NSF's mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This NSF EAGER project award aims to advance resilience science by developing the Resilience-Recovery Under Attack (RRUA) framework, with a focus on the unique challenges faced by Ukraine's digital services sector.  The RRUA framework introduces an innovative and comprehensive approach to resilience science, targeting the complex interdependencies of interconnected infrastructural systems subjected to dynamic threats and shocks. Hence, the project represents a significant leap from traditional resilience strategies that emphasize prevention, instead integrating recovery as a core component of the resilience paradigm. <br/>	We aim to validate the hypothesis that the recovery and resilience of systems under threats and system response stages to diverse shocks can be quantified via stress-testing of interconnected networks representing their systemic functions. We aim to provide novel insights into the lifecycle of resilience under external shocks during acute and persistent shocks, and in particular quantify the key controllers of each of the resilience-response phases to inform efficient recovery interventions. By employing a multi-faceted methodology combining network science, resilience analytics, explainable AI (xAI), and digital twin technologies, the project seeks to redefine systemic recovery modeling and adaptation of interconnected infrastructure across Ukraine, benefiting from the shared knowledge of our proposed international partnership with the USA, Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania.  The project utilizes a three-pronged approach: refining RRUA using data-rich analyses at a US-based international airport, testing concepts and methods in Poland, Estonia and Lithuania testbeds, including human behavior components of vulnerability, and subsequently integrating RRUA within Ukraine's cyber and energy infrastructure systems in the presence of dynamic threats and variable data. Success could revolutionize Ukraine's prospects for recovery, positioning it as a global example for resilience strategies. Our research design will collaboratively explore how to operationalize our RRUA framework across varied settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though these technologies were once science fiction, they are now becoming both affordable and widely available, lending themselves to use in everything from entertainment to medical practice. However, current VR technologies are sometimes not well-matched to people's physical and perceptual characteristics; these mismatches can make VR experiences worse, even to the point of being unusable for some people. This project seeks to advance VR research by combining insights from computer science, neuroscience, and ophthalmology to improve the coupling between VR systems and people's perceptual abilities and physical features. Blending these different perspectives will make it possible to find new and innovative ways to improve VR technologies while better understanding human vision. <br/><br/>This project adopts a comprehensive perspective on the relationship between humans and VR technology. Fundamentally, the imagery presented in VR undergoes a series of distinct transformations including rendering, classical optics, physiological optics, sensation, perception, cognition, and resulting actions. Understanding the nuanced contributions of each stage necessitates embracing methods not traditionally associated with VR research, such as integrating ophthalmic eye models, neuroimaging techniques, computer numerical control systems, and others. For instance, leveraging ophthalmic models allows for the creation of virtual scenes customized to individuals' unique eye structure, enabling enhanced spatial fidelity. Additionally, employing neuroimaging in conjunction with spatial judgment tasks will aid in identifying neural distinctions between perceptions of real and virtual scenes. By employing these methods, this project aims to not only advance the development of high-fidelity virtual environments but also unveil novel approaches to studying human spatial vision. The project team will also develop new interdisciplinary course materials for university students and workshops for middle and high school students that seek to attract a wide variety of students to learn about VR, perception, and their intersection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most studies on the impacts of stress use a biomedical perspective and focus on its negative, non-adaptive effects on health. In contrast, studies based in behavioral ecology assess how stress responses can adaptively rescue organisms from challenges. The dichotomy established by these two approaches limits our understanding of stress because stresses that originally trigger an adaptive response may in time take a cumulative toll resulting in wear-and-tear (reduced longevity) or chronic stress (inability to elicit an adaptive response). To advance knowledge about stress reactivity in general, and social reactivity in particular, this study analyzes two populations of a wild primate that have been naturally exposed to different environmental (natural periods of food restriction) and social (overcrowding) stresses. This comparison offers a powerful tool for detecting how variation in stress responses relate to individual health and fitness. The research develops outreach activities for grade-school children, builds capacity at the field laboratory, and contributes to conservation efforts. This research is the first to make unprecedented gains in understanding the adaptive and maladaptive nature of the stress response in wild primates.  <br/><br/>The study focuses on 120 wild capuchins living in two different forests to: (1) measure the variation in glucocorticoids before and after known social (e.g., aggression between neighboring groups) and ecological stressors (e.g., droughts); (2) quantify each individual?s unique stress response; (3) determine whether these responses are repeatable; (4) determine if the same individuals respond differently to different stressors and/or if the same stressor induces different responses from different individuals, and; (5) assess which if any stress responses have fitness consequences. The study uses a within-subject approach by measuring fine-scale variation in fecal stress hormones (glucocorticoids) before and after facing a known stressor. The data generated builds a baseline for stress-induced hormone levels against which the levels associated with stress-reaction can be compared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumer products and biological structures within the cell both rely on the formation of liquid droplets within another liquid media, known as 'liquid-liquid phase separation'. In biology, this leads to compartments that can organize the interior of the cell. In industry, a similar effect is used to control the 'feel' or texture of personal care or food products. The physical reason for these phase separation phenomena is complicated but is often attributed to several types of large molecules that interact with electrostatic charge. Many of these systems include particles such as folded proteins, which contain nanometer-scale charged patches that interact with long-chain, flexible molecules.<br/> <br/>The PI's group will investigate how the surface of these charged particles affects liquid-liquid phase separation. This will consist of understanding the 'stickiness' between positively-charged molecular chains called polycations, and negatively-charged molecules that form nanoscale structures similar to those found in soap, called surfactant micelles. The polycations and surfactant micelles stick together in a dynamic, gel-like material known as a complex coacervate. This sticking will be highly dependent on the patchiness of the micelles, and the presence of molecules that get in the way of the charged interactions. The PI's group will establish how different patches, and molecular components will affect the propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. This work will show how complicated biological systems, such as patchy proteins, can form similar structures in the cell. This work will also inform the design of consumer products, such as shampoo, cosmetics, and perfumes, and will guide engineers in navigating a complicated design space as they seek to use greener and healthier formulations.<br/> <br/>The integrated education and outreach component of this project supports broader outreach to graduate and undergraduate research training and mentorship. Outreach efforts consist of using interactive computer simulation as the centerpiece of a PI-designed activity within the St. Elmo Brady STEM Academy at the University of Illinois. This project will build up demonstrations needed to understand more 'advanced' aspects of existing efforts, by developing modules that introduce the concepts of (macro)molecules and their corresponding materials. The overall activity will introduce the lifecycle of plastics and sustainability to elementary-age students. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will use simulation and polymer field theory to study how molecular interactions and charge patchiness affect phase separation in polyelectrolyte/particle solutions. A wide variety of materials systems, from consumer products to phase-separated regions in the cell, rely on charge-driven phase separation. This process of 'coacervation' can be driven by the attraction between oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes and particle species such as surfactant micelles or proteins. Taking cues from biology, the PI will establish how charged interactions and patchiness control phase behavior in PE-particle coacervates. <br/> <br/>In this work, the PI will systematically study the relationship between molecular structure, particle configuration, and non-uniform charge patterning. This investigation will build on an established hybrid field theory model, with parameters informed by particle-based simulations to understand the strong, polyelectrolyte-mediated electrostatics between nearby charged particles. This model will be used to first probe the effect of steric repulsion and hydrophobic interactions on surfactant-polyelectrolyte coacervates, and then charged patterns will be introduced onto particles to represent catchy particles or proteins.<br/> <br/>This project will establish the theoretical and computational basis for understanding coacervates formed between polyelectrolytes and a variety of particles that are not flexible polymers, yielding new insights into the role of charged patterning and surface interactions on bulk phase behavior. This will have impact on materials important for a wide range of consumer applications and biological systems.<br/> <br/>Outreach and education are also an integral part of this research project, which will support the interdisciplinary training of at least one graduate and one undergraduate researchers. The PI's group will develop outreach activities, further integrating computation into existing, successful programs such as the St. Elmo Brady STEM Academy. The goal will be to design interactive computational activities to increase student engagement with difficult and abstract concepts in plastic life cycles and recycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impacts of odor pollution have come under increasing scrutiny in recent decades. Agrochemical scent pollution has been found to disrupt bumblebee behavior, a particularly alarming finding in light of their critical role as pollinators in agricultural and natural ecosystems. These findings imply that neural processing of floral odors is impacted by odor pollution. One barrier for understanding these impacts of agrochemicals on bumblebee foraging behavior is that there are no concrete computational structures for representing and exploring odor perception, as current methods are statistical in nature. This means pollution cannot be easily measured, or quantified; which makes it challenging to develop agricultural recommendations. This project is building upon earlier work that established a quantification mechanism for complex odors (i.e. odors made up of many molecules) to establish an algorithm for representing bumblebee odor perception. The established ?Compounds with Borders? (CWB) method allows the difference between any two odors to be represented as an angular distance, and has been used to establish a ?safe zone? of odor pollution for complex odors: polluted-odors within a  20-30 degree range are generalized. Next steps include expanding CWB into a more comprehensive geometry that can accurately account for simpler odors as well.  This work will be performed at a ?primarily undergraduate institution?, incorporating valuable research experiences for the next generation of STEM professionals.<br/><br/><br/>Given the neurophysiological organization of odor processing, the relative importance of molecular-identity versus -feature of odorants is linked to stimulus complexity, with encoding of simpler odors correlating with identity and more complex odors correlating with features. ?Compounds with Borders? is particularly effective for complex blends because it quantifies the amount of sensory energy that is distributed across molecular features in an odor using a Euclidean approach where ?dimensions? in odor space represent those features. The next hurdle  is to expand the geometry of this odor-space to incorporate molecular identity. This is not logistically tractable without data that delineate what level of odor complexity  shifts the primary-processing output from ?identity? to ?feature? correlation.  This project aims to develop a more comprehensive geometry using associative odor learning paradigms combined with recording neural activity at both the input (antennae) and output (antennal lobe tracts) from primary olfactory processing. Gas Chromatography-Electroantennographic recordings will establish a species specific odor-salience across molecular identities and features. Spike-resolved multi-unit recordings from the antennal lobe tracts will assay odor information as it moves forward to integration and action centers.  Comparing the point at which odor responses shift from correlating with molecular identity to molecular feature at a neurophysiological and behavioral level will inform an expanded geometry that utilizes stimulus complexity to shape dimensional weighting. Thus, this work aims to establish a novel paradigm for vertical integration of neural encoding through behavior in olfaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This, in turn, is expected to increase the retention and successful graduation rates of these students. The disciplines of engineering and computer science in general, and the UCSB CoE specifically, disproportionately struggle to retain students from these communities. The Integrated Networking, Scholarship, and Peer Mentoring of Freshmen Engineers for Increased Academic Success and Graduation Rates (INSPIRE) project will create new infrastructure and institutional change to fundamentally transform how students with one or more ""effectors of opportunity"" experience the first year of engineering. INSPIRE will consist of a year-long, seminar-based curriculum that holistically inter-weaves academic and social curriculum and peer mentoring. By increasing the successful retention and graduation rates of targeted students, INSPIRE will educate and develop a new generation of diverse engineering and computer science graduates. These individuals will have the opportunity to pursue graduate degrees and/or join the workforce, where they can be role models who help hire and train future engineering and computer science talent.<br/><br/>This project will focus its educational research on assessing how the proposed holistic approach changes (if at all) students? internal narrative around success and failure, intrinsic motivation to persist in their discipline, and use of social support networks. This research will contribute new knowledge in peer mentoring and first-year retention by analyzing the differential effects of INSPIRE on retention and social identification, social capital, and social learning. A key outcome is to have a systematic approach to identifying the needs of stake-holders including faculty, undergraduate students, graduate students, and administrative support for retention to bring about institutional change.

Hendrix College is a liberal arts college situated in central Arkansas and primarily serves students in the rural regions of the South. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 28 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, biochemistry & molecular biology, chemistry, chemical physics, computer science, mathematics, and physics. Eligible first-year students will receive four-year scholarships to attend Hendrix College and pursue the STEM disciplines. In addition to receiving scholarships, students will engage closely with faculty mentors and each other in shared coursework, participate in a peer mentoring program designed to foster a sense of belonging and engagement in the sciences, receive internship and research opportunities, converse with professional scientists, and undertake a STEM-themed community project. In partnership with the Arkansas Innovation Hub, scholarship program participants will design and execute a project that addresses student-identified community challenges. Students will leverage their scientific skill sets and connections to the rural places of the South to consider how they can contribute to the innovation economy in their communities to bolster infrastructure and other scientific needs in the region. This project seeks to advance the understanding of strategies to retain talented scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians in areas of the country that most need their skill sets. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are four specific aims: 1) Recruit, retain, and graduate 3 cohorts of low-income students with a baccalaureate degree in the scientific disciplines, 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of a science-based community project in helping scholars develop a professional scientific identity tied to civic engagement in a rural context, 3) Expand engagement of faculty with students from underserved backgrounds, and 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of a deep teaching professional development program emphasizing growth mindset in changing faculty mindsets and approaches about teaching and mentoring. The project seeks to expand what is known about teaching and mentoring approaches that best engage students from rural and low-income backgrounds in the scientific endeavor and determine how to retain them in their local communities following training. Prior research demonstrates that faculty are major determinants of whether students from limited economic backgrounds persist in the scientific disciplines, and those that take a growth mindset about students, positively impact persistence. Deep teaching professional development is an intensive, reflective approach that can lead to overall mindset changes, but little is known about its efficacy when combined with growth mindset training. Additionally, development of a scientific identity is critical to persistence in the scientific disciplines, but few studies have addressed how to develop an identity that is tied to civic engagement in a rural context. The project will investigate how a deep teaching professional development experience designed to enhance growth mindset in faculty affects their approaches to teaching, advising, and mentoring. It will also evaluate how having a faculty mentor trained in growth mindset in the first year of matriculation impacts feelings of belonging, self-efficacy, and resilience. Finally, it will investigate how participation in a science-based community project impacts identity, self-efficacy, civic engagement, and resilience. This project has the potential to advance understanding of how to support and retain talented trained individuals in the scientific workforce in the rural areas of the country that require innovative scientific solutions. This project will be evaluated using a mixed method approach that measures growth mindset, a sense of belonging, resilience, and civic engagement. Results of this project will be made available to diverse stakeholders at multiple levels of organization on the Hendrix campus, state-wide, and nationally. Specifically, results will be disseminated to Arkansas secondary and postsecondary educators and members of state legislature to raise important issues that impact the state. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

However, the molecular details of how the bacteria in these communities interact with each other and their environment to perform these functions are still not understood. This project will use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and genomic methods to determine how bacteria in a community that consumes the greenhouse gas methane interact using chemical signaling molecules, and how these interactions influence the rate of methane consumption. The research results will help in understanding the structure and function of important bacterial communities, to allow for modeling and prediction of these processes in the future. To increase career awareness in biochemistry amongst students at the University of Utah, the project will use a multicomponent approach entitled Biochemists: Behind the Scene which integrates with and enhances existing initiatives at the University of Utah. This approach will introduce students to the people and processes behind biochemistry research, to make this field more relatable and help these students develop a science identity and sense of self-efficacy.<br/><br/>Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacterial communities sequester this potent greenhouse gas by distributing methane-derived carbon among direct oxidizers and bacteria that do not oxidize methane themselves. These organisms are therefore an important part of the carbon cycle. However, the molecular details that govern interactions in these ecologically critical consortia are still not understood. Many bacteria use quorum sensing signals to regulate group behaviors in bacterial communities. While the role of quorum sensing has been studied in many individual species, much less work has been done on its role in whole communities that resemble those found in natural environments. This project will determine the role of quorum sensing in a model methane-oxidizing bacterial community. Quorum sensing signals present in the community will be identified using previously established quorum sensing signal identification methodologies, including inverse stable isotopic labeling, to determine which community members can produce these signals. A combination of untargeted metabolomics, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics will be used to identify these signals and the genes they regulate in the model community, with complementary mechanistic studies in bacterial isolates and simplified synthetic communities. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how quorum sensing governs the structure and function of this system. This work will also characterize new quorum sensing signals and link regulated genes to their phenotypes, which will enable future predictions of molecular interactions in this and other environmentally important microbial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, there is an urgent need for the development of more stress-resilient crop plants through breeding to safeguard our future food security. A critical component of plant stress defense pathways is the epigenome which is a critical regulatory layer of various structural features that control the interpretation of the genetic information in an environmental cue-dependent manner. The architects responsible for shaping the dynamic plant epigenome are DNA-binding proteins, commonly known as transcription factors. They act as pivotal recruitment platforms for protein complexes capable of altering the structure of the epigenome. This project will use a newly developed high-throughput epigenome profiling platform to investigate the role of the master MYC-type helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2 in shaping the environmentally-responsive epigenome. Since MYC2 controls a major branch of the plant defense network, it is anticipated that a better understanding of its function will provide significant new insight with the potential to advance the development of resilient crops for U.S. agriculture. The newly developed platform will be made available to other researchers in the field thereby broadly impacting plant science research. Equally important to improve breeding efforts is training the next generation of scientists and introducing them to genomics-enabled research. This opportunity will be facilitated through the Epigenome Explorer course, where students can dive into the study of dynamic plant epigenomes and uncover thrilling new information. <br/><br/>Harnessing the regulatory capabilities of master transcription factors to engineer plants with enhanced stress resilience holds great promise mitigating the negative impact of the current climate crisis. Plant immune responses against herbivorous insects and fungi are controlled by the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway with MYC2 as its master regulator. Perception of the defense hormone JA directly controls the composition and consequently the functional output of the MYC2-centric JA-responsive epigenome which comprises MYC2, various transcriptional co-activators/repressors, and chromatin regulators. Despite its significant regulatory importance, the dynamic nature and the functional repertoire of this regulatory module remains poorly understood. The goal of this project will shed light on how MYC2 establishes the JA-responsive epigenome in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By utilizing the newly developed PHILO (Plant HIgh-throughput LOw input) ChIP-seq platform, the MYC2-centric JA-responsive epigenome will be comprehensively investigated with an emphasis on JA-induced enhancer regions. CRISPR/Cas9-facilated cis-regulatory variation will also be utilized to reveal general principles of the MYC2 module during active JA signaling. Moreover, by perturbing the JA-responsive epigenome with elevated temperature, an unexplored but immensely important crosstalk between a plant immune pathway and the thermomorphogenesis pathway will be studied.

The project will bring transformative change by designing intelligent and adaptive protection schemes in response to challenges associated with modern power grids with different operational modes and circuit topologies and under high penetration of Inverter-based Resources (IBRs). These challenges can deteriorate the performance of conventional protection schemes and may result in detrimental impacts like widespread blackouts. Therefore, there is a need to redesign the conventional protection systems and make them adaptive to the prevailing power grid conditions. This will be achieved by designing a scalable APP that can take adaptive protection actions in transmission and distribution electric power grids. The intellectual merits of the project include addressing the protection challenges that rise from the high penetration of IBRs by incorporating software and hardware solutions that improve the reliability, selectivity, sensitivity, and security of the underlying protection system. The broader impacts of the project include broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in power engineering and integrating practical and real-world concepts into the existing curriculum of power engineering. This will be achieved by organizing summer camps and other outreach activities for underrepresented K-12 and college students and designing new course topics for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of New Mexico (UNM).<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are (i) to design an adaptive protection platform that is responsive to extreme events using a stochastic optimization algorithm for optimizing protection relay settings, and (ii) to create communication-free and adaptive local protection modules. The proposed research will formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to identify feasible relay settings that satisfy the relay?s coordination time interval constraints for different circuit topology scenarios caused by extreme events. On the other hand, the local adaptive protection module will be designed using unsupervised conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) for fault detection and physics-informed machine learning algorithms for fault location.

Its deformation under external forces depends on the extent and speed of loading. Rapid deformation of the brain during events such as blasts and automotive crashes can cause traumatic brain injury. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the human brain under such extreme conditions is critical to developing computer models for predicting brain injury. This knowledge is also needed to design safer personal protective equipment and brain injury management and prevention strategies. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the mechanical behavior of living humans' brains is restricted to small deformations and a narrow range of loading rates that do not represent the full spectrum of injury-causing conditions. This award supports fundamental research combining high-rate mechanical testing, analytical and computational modeling, and machine learning to generate insights into how the living human brain responds to large and rapid loading. Results from this research will positively impact U.S. national health and welfare and will contribute to the fields of tissue mechanics, traumatic brain injury, and machine learning. This project will lead to new courses and involve contributions from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the high strain rate mechanics of the brain in its native biophysical environment. The first stage will focus on tissue responses under small deformations and dynamic strain rates. Wide-band Magnetic Resonance Elastography experiments will be conducted on brain tissue specimens from multiple brain regions to develop linear viscoelastic constitutive models. Multi-fidelity models will be developed to fuse the observed responses with available narrow-band in vivo brain tissue responses for predicting linear viscoelastic properties of the in vivo brain tissue in a wide range of loading frequencies. The second stage will focus on tissue responses under large deformations and extreme strain rates. Quasi-static and dynamic mechanical testing will be conducted to develop visco-hyperelastic constitutive models. Physics-informed multi-fidelity models will be developed to fuse the ex vivo visco-hyperelastic responses with the in vivo linear viscoelastic responses characterized in the previous stage. This study will significantly advance our understanding of brain biomechanics by generating insights into the relationship between in vivo and ex vivo tissue mechanics and the first-ever full-field maps of the living brain?s mechanical properties applicable under extreme loading conditions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For decades, database systems have been built for monolithic servers, where compute, memory, and storage are tightly integrated. However, these traditional databases now struggle to meet the stringent requirements of elasticity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, especially when supporting large-scale applications in the cloud. Recently, there has been an emerging technology trend towards hardware resource disaggregation, which involves physically separating the hardware resources (such as compute, memory, and storage) into distinct resource pools to enable independent and elastic resource scaling. However, this disaggregated architecture presents fundamental challenges for traditional databases. This project will build a new database system that is specifically optimized for resource disaggregation to substantially improve performance, scalability, and elasticity. This will, in turn, significantly reduce costs for database customers and yield substantial economic benefits for society. The developed techniques will be open-sourced to enhance the research infrastructure. Research findings will be disseminated through publications at top-tier venues and will be incorporated into both graduate-level and undergraduate-level database courses at Purdue University. Furthermore, this project will foster diversity and inclusion by actively engaging groups that are traditionally underrepresented in this field, such as women, minority groups, and underprivileged students.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project investigates the profound impact of resource disaggregation (with respect to both storage and memory) on database systems. It presents a new disaggregated database system through three key thrusts. The first thrust introduces new approaches to efficiently manage database logs and perform transaction commits for storage disaggregation. The second thrust proposes new techniques to optimize database indexes and the buffer manager for memory disaggregation. The third thrust develops a new distributed database architecture for memory disaggregation and redesigns concurrency control and crash recovery. Overall, this project will drive the next wave of innovation in the field of database systems by starting a new line of research on disaggregated data(base) systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goals of the workshop are to (1) bring together researchers in combinatorics and graph theory to communicate and exchange ideas; (2) promote open problem-sharing and discussions among participants; (3) expose junior researchers to the latest developments in these areas; and (4) broaden and stimulate the research of junior, female, and underrepresented researchers.<br/><br/>The field of combinatorics concerns problems and techniques in discrete settings. It is closely related to other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from evolutionary biology to computer science and from logic to statistical physics. Graph theory is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, and it has numerous natural connections to other areas. The workshop will feature two plenary speakers and eight early-career speakers. Moreover, we plan to organize an open problem session and a discussion session that allows participants of the workshop to exchange insights and ideas on open problems that are relevant and interesting to the larger mathematics and computer science community. The workshop website is located at https://my.vanderbilt.edu/cgt2024/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent discoveries of ternary compounds with frustrated vanadium sublattices, meaning magnetic spins cannot arrange in alternating directions (think putting the spins on the corners of a triangle), have revealed multiple exotic phenomena, including superconductivity, residing within a single material. Even more intriguingly, these phenomena are found to interact and compete. Understanding the implications of these interactions is challenging because only a few material examples are known. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Toberer and his research group employ strategies to discover new crystalline compounds that contain layers of magnetic vanadium atoms. First, active search algorithms are utilized to efficiently explore ternary vanadium chemical spaces through a combination of (i) first principles calculations of known and hypothetical compounds and (ii) bulk synthesis and structure determination. Second, the fundamental properties of new vanadium ternary compounds are determined through low temperature measurements and quantum mechanical calculations. Third, single crystals are grown of the most promising compounds for further low temperature measurements. Together, these tasks are expected to enable the next generation of quantum materials. Interwoven throughout these efforts are educational opportunities for undergraduate students and scientific engagement with the broader public.  These include summer research opportunities, public lectures on the intersection of solid-state chemistry with mineralogy and gemology, and a week-long summer camp on solid-state chemistry for students from rural areas of Colorado. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Toberer and his research group seek to uncover new classes of vanadium polar intermetallics compounds where electronic correlations and topological band structures intersect on magnetically frustrated lattices. The inspiration for this research comes from recent discoveries within the KV3Sb5 and REV6Sn6 material classes; these compounds contain vanadium kagome sublattices that give rise to nontrivial topology, charge density waves, and superconductivity. The research begins with experimentally establishing ternary A-V-Z phase diagrams and associated novel compounds therein using bulk solid state chemistry approaches; these efforts leverage guidance from first principles calculations and physics-informed Bayesian optimization. For each new compound, the electronic structure and topology of each new compound is predicted using first principles methods for down-selection for single crystal growth using fluxes. Low temperature characterization of these single crystals reveals potential electronic instabilities arising from magnetic frustration; further characterization is facilitated through a commitment to sample sharing with the broader condensed matter community. The discovery and study of new quantum materials based on frustrated vanadium nets will ultimately enhance our understanding of the interaction between topology, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Interwoven throughout these activities are efforts to (i) build a new generation of STEM talent at the intersection of solid-state materials chemistry, condensed matter physics, and statistical decision making, (ii) broaden participation in STEM via targeted outreach, and (iii) engage the broader public in solid-state chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This quantum theory has been validated repeatedly in different experiments for both the electricity- and heat-carrying capabilities of electrons in different nanostructures. In comparison, there has been only one reported experimental observation of the predicted quantum behavior of the heat-carrying ability in a polycrystalline silicon nitride nanostructure. In response to a call for further experimental investigations of the quantum theory of lattice heat transport, this project is focused on experimental investigation of this quantum theory in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a unique measurement method. Success of this research is expected to both enhance the understanding of a essential pillar of condensed matter physics and provide education and outreach opportunities for broadening the participation in quantum and thermal science research and technology developments.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: Free of two-level defects, SWCNTs are closest to an ideal one-dimensional (1D) quantum system among the nanostructures that have been experimentally realized. The goal of this work is to advance multiprobe measurements of the intrinsic thermal conductance of 1D nanostructures for accurate detection of the quantized phonon conductance that has been predicted for a SWCNT at a relatively high temperature up to about 10 K. This temperature range is much more conducive to producing unambiguous experimental evidence of quantized phonon conductance than the below-0.8 K temperature required for prior studies of silicon nitride nanobeams. If successful, the proposed measurements of SWCNTs will establish an experimental capability for detecting and controlling quantized phonon transport behaviors of low-dimensional systems.

Planets form in disks of gas and dust around newborn stars, but disks disappear as the stars age, limiting the opportunity for planets to form. Disks may spiral into the central star or evaporate from the inside-out via the newborn star?s photons. However, external photoevaporation from a nearby, much brighter star can destroy disks more quickly, reducing the time and materials to make planets. While this phenomenon has been observed in a few objects, this project will quantify whether such external photoevaporation is a major player in this story of planet formation. Leveraging a large dataset of young star clusters, Dr. Megan Reiter of Rice University and her research associates will measure the disks themselves, starlight impinging on them, and matter streaming away from them. In parallel, an educational program to encourage entrance and persistence in STEM fields will be implemented in two parts: an active-learning teacher training and astronomy-inspired curriculum for Houston K-12 schools, and foundational skills will be added to observational lab courses at Rice University; these interventions will preferentially help historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To quantify this environmental impact on planet formation, Dr. Reiter has secured more than 100 hours of telescope time using the integral field unit spectrograph MUSE on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. The goal is to observe thousands of low-mass stars and their disks in high-mass star-forming regions of at least 1000 times the mass of the Sun ? a sample 100 times larger than existing studies. These data cleanly separate stellar emission from the bright, variable nebular background. Spectral diagnostics indicate active external photoevaporation and quantify the mass-loss rate. A scaling relationship between incident UV flux and external disk photoevaporation will be derived, useful when theorists model the demographics of planets. The methods developed and astronomy professionals supported by this work will be in high demand when 30-meter class ground-based telescopes become available. The educational intervention will include value-engaged evaluation, a new way to test whether updated pedagogy improves retention in STEM courses at Rice and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the upcycling of platform intermediate chemicals, PE and PP-derived products are particularly useful for subsequent conversion to produce high-value materials such as surfactants (e.g., soaps, detergents, surface modifiers, etc.). The output of high-value surfactants from low-cost plastic waste can provide significant financial incentives to address the existing fast-accumulating plastic waste. The controlled ?Deg-Up? of PE and PP, which will be the focus of this project, will offer new approaches to producing sustainable surfactants with reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions. Downstream functionalization of PE and PP-derived intermediate molecules will pave the foundation for the future development of ?waste-to-value? using other plastic waste feedstocks.  Highly integrated with the concept of ?plastic sustainability?, the educational component of the project will train students at all levels including underrepresented local K-12 and college youth, work with neighboring Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and develop sustainable plastic waste removal programs in Appalachia. <br/><br/> <br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>The vast amount of accumulated plastic waste requires a better ending point than landfills or oceans. Chemical upcycling is an attractive method to bring low-value plastic waste into high-value chemicals and materials. This project utilizes plastic waste as a chemical feedstock, much like ?crude oil? except that it requires no drilling or mining. Two high-volume plastics, including polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), will be converted to high-value surfactants. The project will (a) provide an understanding of temperature-gradient thermolysis for producing controlled degradation intermediates and (b) develop upcycling strategies to produce value-added ionic and non-ionic surfactants. Three main research tasks of the project include: 1) employment of temperature-gradient thermolysis to degrade PE and PP, 2) functionalization of the thermolysis products with ionic end groups to form amphiphilic molecules for use as surfactants, and 3) functionalization of the thermolysis products into non-ionic molecules. The proposed research will impact the fields of polymers and surfactants and enable the upcycling of plastics into high-value chemicals. The upcycling strategy removes plastic waste, elongates the lifespan of carbon in a reduced form, decreases carbon emissions, and mitigates environmental pollution. The educational impacts include training underrepresented K-12 and first-generation college students in Appalachia. The educational components share the central theme of ?polymer sustainability? and are highly integrated with research.  <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical looping combustion is one promising approach where metal oxide particles (i.e., oxygen carriers) are used to oxidize fuel without nitrogen present to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and improve efficiency of capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide. However, the longevity of the oxygen carrier particles limits the technologies widespread use. An approach is needed where the combustion process is used to oxidize fuel while controlling the structure of the particles. Control of the particle structure will extend particle longevity and reduce attrition. Metal oxide nanoparticles are synthesized in a similar aerosol process but have not been extended to reduce metal oxide particles to metal. Thus, this project seeks to identify the physical and chemical processes that will enable control of copper oxide, a common oxygen carrier, reduction. In addition, research will be introduced to community college students pretransfer to improve student goals that will reduce gaps in postgraduate engineering degrees for students that start post-secondary education at community colleges. These efforts will improve the ability to produce power while decreasing environmental impact and increase the diversity of the technical workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to use self-sustaining dust flames, whose structure dictates the particle time-temperature history, to control the reduction process of CuO, a common oxygen carrier, to overcome agglomeration and attrition issues present in chemical looping combustion. This idea seeks to determine the physics that will enable reduction process to be controlled under the fast heating conditions, about 0.1-1.0 million degrees Kelvin per second, rather than the traditional isothermal conditions in chemical looping combustion. Constant volume dust flame experiments will quantify the flame structure and limiting processes of CuO-gaseous fuel flames, while providing a link between time-temperature history and product particle (i.e., Cu, Cu2O, or mixture) structure. Quasi-1D dusty flames will be used to the refine time-temperature history to control the product particle structure (e.g., particle size, grain size and orientation, etc.) such that the cause for the formation of particle morphology and size, preferred crystal faces, and grain size is determined. Experimental work will be complemented by implementing detailed surface chemistry and a constant-N Monte Carlo models to understand the interplay between combustion chemistry, aerosol physics, and particle structure. This approach will accelerate chemical looping combustion technology development to improve clean energy and carbon capture capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many PhD producing departments, teaching track faculty positions with academic rank and expectations for scholarship are relatively new, and departments are still establishing these roles and best practices related to the hiring and career progression for these positions.  To meet the need for teaching-focused faculty members, it is imperative to educate PhD students, post-doctoral scholars, teaching-focused faculty members, and individuals considering a career change about the opportunities and responsibilities associated with these positions.<br/><br/>The series of workshops will include two 1-day, in-person, PD Workshops for current teaching track faculty members and two Virtual Academic Workshop Series for PhD students, post-doctoral scholars, and industry professionals seeking an academic career change. The PD Workshops will be held in conjunction with the ACM?s Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education?s (SIGCSE) conferences in 2024 and 2025 and will offer opportunities for teaching faculty to network and share information for their career development, including career paths, scholarship options, and promotion opportunities. They will also address the role teaching track faculty can play in expanding undergraduate research opportunities and create guidance on a standardization of the teaching faculty interview practices.  The Virtual Academic Landscape Workshop Series will expose individuals interested in teaching-focused faculty positions to the types of teaching-focused faculty careers, the preparation needed for these careers, and the job application process. To broaden participation in these workshops, series, and careers by individuals who identify with groups underrepresented in computing, CRA will undertake coordinated marketing with Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances to achieve a broad representation of speakers and participants, with particular focus on teaching track faculty at HBCUs/MSIs/TCs.

Designing faster and more reliable data analysis algorithms is a key challenge in broadening the scope of such applications. However, researchers have realized that the classical framework of algorithm design is inadequate for this task. This is because large data in almost every application is modeled using statistical models as opposed to the standard worst-case model used in algorithm design. Consequently, central challenges that involve an interplay between algorithms and statistically generated data remain widely unresolved not just in machine learning but also in statistical physics and cryptography. This project will address this critical deficiency by building a principled theory of algorithm design for statistical (aka average-case) data. The new paradigms explored in this work will unify the currently fragmented set of approaches for studying average-case computation. The curriculum development plan outlined in this project will train the next generation of scientists in the algorithmic methods tailor-made for problems in large scale statistical data analysis and disseminate the modern paradigms for understanding computation to both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Average-case complexity is a central thrust in the theory of computation with a direct impact on potential technological advances in machine learning and cryptography as well as basic questions in statistical physics. Examples include training expressive statistical models such as Gaussian mixture models and Sparse PCA to find patterns in large data in machine learning, ascertaining the security of pseudo-random generators in cryptography, and finding the lowest-energy states of spin-glass systems in statistical physics. Our current understanding of such problems is based on fragmented, domain-specific algorithmic schemes such as statistical query methods and method of moments (in machine learning), belief propagation (in statistical physics), and semidefinite programming hierarchies (in computational complexity). This project is devoted to building a unified theory of average-case computation that offers new tools to design better algorithms, prove sharp lower-bounds, and allow rigorously transferring insights between different specific frameworks. This investigation will build new bridges between theoretical computer science and several adjacent areas including machine learning, statistical physics, algebraic geometry, and probability. In addition, it will further develop the burgeoning understanding of the sum-of-squares semidefinite programming hierarchy, mixture models, and use of solution-space geometry in solving random constraint satisfaction problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Taking inspiration from the Fibonacci pattern found in sunflowers, this research will establish new design principles for irregular geometric patterns, thus revolutionizing current geometric designs in lattices. Irregular designs of acoustic architected materials offer two groundbreaking achievements, currently unattainable through regular designs: enhanced control of nonlinear wave dynamics and expanded attenuation bandwidth. This research will deepen the current understanding of the physics underlying the relationships between geometric variations and collective wave dynamics in artificially engineered and architected materials,and will catalyze the development of the next generation of patterned materials for diverse engineering applications involving acoustic, electromagnetic, and photonic sources or detectors. Reparative learning development activities will target schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged, noise-impacted communities to demonstrate the efficacy of affordable irregular pattern metamaterials in mitigating the recent surge in noise from aircraft jets and airports that adversely affects these communities. Beyond classroom activities, the project aims, through collaboration with community activists, at empowering and enabling these communities to create their own adaptable and economically viable alternatives to current, often toxic, acoustic absorption products. <br/><br/>This NSF project will develop models and experimental prototypes that establish the physical laws behind, and practical applications of, geometric variants in engineering irregular patterned material systems. The models are based on a continuum approximation to forecast the impact of commonly occurring geometric variations found in nature on the dynamics of acoustic waves in resonant lattices. Irregular patterns will be characterized by geometric variants of the resonators? rigidity and proximity. Utilizing this model, we will optimize absorption, impedance, and phase properties while expanding the frequency range within irregular lattices, with these properties being functions of the mentioned geometric variants. Building on the insights gained from the models, acoustic attenuation will be executed through prototype designs. Each panel will incorporate Helmholtz resonators featuring both regular and irregular Fibonacci patterns. The primary objective is to mitigate sound in the 200-2000 Hz frequency range, known to be detrimental to human hearing and health, such as noise from highway traffic, aircraft jets, trains, airports, and construction activities.

One-third of teachers in WV leave the field within their first four years on the job. Such challenges have impacted student performance resulting in extremely low math and science proficiency scores. It is estimated ~9,600 rural P-12 students could be directly impacted through the duration of this project. To achieve the project?s objectives, Concord University (CU) will deliver an online Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) curriculum, implement a comprehensive wrap around mentorship program utilizing a virtual platform to connect a multidisciplinary team of mentors with the TFs, develop and maintain a Professional Learning Community (PLC), and incorporate the use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology within the MAT curriculum.  Furthermore, CU will utilize the virtual platform as well as data management software for ongoing mentoring and tracking of TFs as they fill STEM teaching positions in rural high-need P-12 schools.<br/><br/>This project at Concord University includes partnerships with Mercer, McDowell, and Summers County Schools, SIBME, and the West Virginia Science Teachers Association. Project goals include (1) recruit and advance 16 STEM professionals as Teaching Fellows (TFs) to become STEM educators within rural, high-need schools and (2) provide comprehensive mentoring and supports to TFs to ensure persistence and retention through their MAT program and induction.  The project will incorporate cutting-edge technology for TFs and P-12 student in rural high-need schools and establish effective methods for supporting TFs hired in STEM teaching positions. The work will be evaluated by Brockport Research Institute. The evaluation will include mixed method quantitative and qualitative analyses of data collected from surveys, interviews, extant data, and document review.

Error correcting codes are also theoretically fundamental objects that find unexpected connections to areas like algorithms, computational complexity, and cryptography, where the applications have no apparent need for noise-resilience. Error-correcting codes have a long and rich history.

Friendship also combats loneliness, an epidemic that has been described as a defining public health concern of our time. Indeed, about 4 in 10 Americans are lonely, and therefore at risk of living shorter, less fulling lives. This project shines a light on the psychology of friendship by deploying a new theoretical framework. This framework emphasizes that friend pairs, which have been the focus of past work, live in wider social worlds, where each friend can interact with a network of other people. As a result, the challenges of finding, making, and keeping friends are more complex than one might think, and that previous research has found. These challenges might involve both simpler and well-studied two-person components (getting friends to like us) but also lesser-studied multi-person components (getting friends to like us better than they like their other friends). <br/><br/>This program of research fills major gaps in our basic understanding of how friendship works by focusing on these vital but understudied social relationships. The project has three aims. One is to identify the various challenges that people must solve to realize friendships. A second is to better describe what these complex challenges look like. These two aims support a third aim of generating new insights into how people solve these friendship challenges. This project examines friendship challenges and their solutions in a series of cross-cultural surveys, laboratory experiments, and via cutting-edge methods such as machine learning and network analysis.

Two significant aspects of this activity are addressed by this project, namely the ability to process data at scale and to construct models that can accurately predict future behavior. The first aspect is connected to sublinear algorithms, which identify small subsets of data that accurately represent the entire dataset. The second aspect is connected to optimization methods to identify underlying models that best explain existing data. This project will discover new mathematical connections between these two aspects, and this interplay will lead to both faster optimization methods and better sublinear algorithms for fundamental problems of practical relevance. Furthermore, findings of this project will enhance curricula for advanced algorithms courses and will train future generations of graduate students.<br/><br/>Many data sets today can be characterized as collection of points in high-dimensional space, and models are functions defined over this domain. Property testing provides a rigorous approach towards inferring properties of these functions with a small sample. Optimization problems address methods to choose a point that maximizes or minimizes the function value. This project will address connections between these methods. In particular, the project uses optimization techniques for developing better property testers for canonical properties such as submodularity and (discrete) convexity, both long-standing fundamental open problems. In the other direction, the project uses techniques from property testing to design new robust algorithms for optimization problems.

Guilford College is a coeducational, liberal arts institution located in Greensboro, NC and the only Quaker-founded college in the southeastern United States. Over its 5-year duration, this project will provide scholarships of up to four years to 10 full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, chemistry, or computing technology and information systems (CTIS). The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with opportunities to engage in a breadth of opportunities: peer and faculty mentoring; undergraduate research experiences; an interdisciplinary seminar experience; alumni speakers; internship opportunities; participation in discipline-specific conferences; and exploring pathways to graduate school. The project's financial and wrap-around cohort resources will provide scholars with the opportunities, community, motivation, and skills to be successful in their STEM studies and careers. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are four specific aims: (1) recruit 10 low-income, first-year students planning to major in biology, chemistry, and CTIS and who have high academic potential and unmet financial need into two cohorts of 5, (2) retain at least 80% of Scholars into their second year; (3) graduate at least 75% of Scholars within five years of matriculation; and (4) yield 100% of Scholar graduates securing STEM employment or graduate school placement within six months of graduation. The external evaluation of the proposed effort is aimed at deepening understanding of the contributions that proposed student supports, when paired with scholarships, can make to a liberal arts institution?s goals of increased retention and graduation of low-income STEM students. Knowledge generated will be widely disseminated through conferences, peer-reviewed journals, student presentations and papers, institutional media, webinars, websites, and other forums to inspire and share lessons learned. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

An understanding of how cells control and rearrange genetic operations, particularly during conditions of stress, could lead to efficient engineering of living organisms for applications that require robust adaptation to different environments. Ultimately, advances in the field of synthetic gene networks will allow development of novel schemes to produce chemical compounds of interest, for example. At the molecular level, some of the most sophisticated native networks that control gene behavior involve both proteins and nucleic acids. Yet, deciphering the many ways in which associated proteins and nucleic acids work together to regulate their gene targets remains largely unknown. In this project, a team of researchers use experimental and modeling tools to explore mechanisms involved in a conserved bacterial gene regulatory network that controls metabolism under nutritional stresses. The project provides research opportunities to students from low-income underrepresented communities and contributes to piloting a cross-discipline course Engineering for Change to support STEM students. <br/><br/>Developing systems for precise control of genes in biological systems continues to be paramount for advancing the synthetic biology field. Post-transcriptional regulatory networks, involving RNA-binding proteins that regulate both mRNAs and sRNAs, remain largely understudied despite expectations that they illustrate sophisticated native schemes of robust and timely control of gene expression. In this project, an interdisciplinary team of researchers, including graduate and undergraduate students, explore new suspected regulatory mechanisms used by RNA-binding proteins within a well-conserved bacterial central global carbon metabolism network. Specifically, the team combines Next Generation Sequencing, microscopy, biomolecular characterization techniques, traditional genetic in vivo methods, and computational tools to: (i) Investigate the formation of bacterial condensates as a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation activity, and (ii) Elucidate dynamic regulatory outcomes as a consequence of regulatory binding sites alternative usage. Results from this work are expected to aid development of novel control mechanisms of bacterial systems that are more naturally aligned with native cellular metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While it has supported the tremendous growth of the Internet, the Internet has changed and the applications that run on it are very different from those the Internet originally supported. BGP is not performance-aware, and so it may not choose the best-performing routes. Previous work found that the routes it chooses are often good enough for traditional Internet applications like web browsing, email, and streaming video that can tolerate good-enough performance and temporary blips. However, emerging use cases such as remote health monitoring, telemedicine, virtual reality/adaptive reality, self-driving cars, and robotized factories require reliable low-latency, high-throughput performance to support real-time, interactive, and sometimes critical applications. Despite these needs, BGP cannot simply be replaced or upgraded, as tens of thousands of independent networks rely on it to interconnect and exchange traffic.<br/><br/>The project's objectives are twofold: (1) understanding the circumstances in which BGP?s performance and availability are ""good enough"" and identifying when this is not so; and (2) proposing systems for enhancing BGP?s performance and availability, without requiring undeployable changes to BGP itself. If successful, the project will be the basis for the Internet services of tomorrow, with dependable real-time interactions over rich applications, providing new capabilities to users around the world.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the performance and availability of BGP and explore whether and how BGP can be used to optimize performance for the next generation of real-time Internet-based services. The research will address these questions in the context of three critical challenges in modern Internet application delivery: determining to which site to direct the user, routing across the wide area to the site, and selecting a route back to the client from the site. It will develop novel approaches to using BGP that enable it to serve as the underpinning of emerging critical applications.

Acidic soils with low pH are widespread globally and common in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where food security is a challenge. Aluminum (Al) toxicity, a significant abiotic stress on acidic soils, damages root systems and enhances crop susceptibility to drought and mineral deficiencies. Previous studies have shown that genes in the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family of membrane transporters play an important role in Al tolerance in sorghum and maize while others strongly implicate epigenetic variation in DNA methylation and histone modification in Al tolerance in various plant species. This project will take a multi-omics approach to identify and explore variation in Al tolerance at both the genetic and epigenetic levels, using Al tolerance as a paradigm to connect gene regulation to abiotic stress tolerance in cereals. It is expected that this project will have significant impacts for facilitating translation of findings from maize and sorghum genetics/epigenetics and genomics research to develop more effective breeding strategies targeting adaptation to broader abiotic stress conditions. With respect to training and outreach, in addition to the training of project students and postdoctoral scientists, the project will develop a module on translational genomics focusing on Al tolerance that will be included in the long-running Cereal Genomics Workshop held at Cold Spring Harbor Lab. <br/><br/>Homologous genes in the MATE family of membrane transporters play an important role in Al tolerance in sorghum (SbMATE) and maize (ZmMATE1) by mediating release of Al detoxifying citrate into the rhizosphere. Studies have shown that Al-induced expression of SbMATE is not just localized to the root apex, which is the site of Al toxicity and tolerance, but also very specifically to the epidermal and cortical cells in the distal transition zone. This project will leverage single-cell transcriptomics technologies that will provide the spatial resolution necessary to discover novel Al tolerance genes by associating epigenetic responses with cell-specific gene expression. Candidate regulatory elements will be functionally validated using gene editing and mutant analyses and Al tolerance phenotypes will be evaluated in controlled conditions and in the field on well-characterized acidic soils. All project outcomes will be made available and broadly distributed through deposition at the appropriate long-term data repositories and stock centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Curiously, evidence suggests that bacteria can be credited with social behavior and decision-making abilities. Despite the increasing acceptance of the idea of social behavior and communication in bacteria, it is not yet known how these small scale behaviors influence microbial community interactions in nature. This study will provide the first test of whether microbial social interactions lead to impacts in function at the ecosystem level using microbial communities from both natural grassland and agricultural soil. Communication in the form of chemical signals that can be detected by bacteria will influence whether cells will make various extracellular enzymes that degrade plant matter. The social organization of these bacterial communities could allow for a division of labor, with some species contributing one set of enzymes and other species contributing different ones, thereby increasing the efficiency of organic matter decomposition. In this way, social interactions among bacteria could influence how well the entire ecosystem works. The research will also provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Students will gain experience in field, lab, and computational techniques, including bioinformatics and mathematical modeling approaches that link game theory to ecological processes, and will participate in outreach to high school science students and their teacher. <br/><br/>In soil, bacteria are most likely to interact with other bacteria within clumps of soil particles known as aggregates. Aggregates give soil a structure, which helps water and oxygen flow, protects carbon in soil, and supports diverse communities of microorganisms. These microbes decompose dead plants and animals, recycle nutrients, and help new plants to thrive. Soil that is mechanically disturbed, for example by plowing, loses many of its aggregates and overall structure. This team of researchers hypothesize that soil aggregates, like those found in prairie soils that have not been farmed for many years, will provide the necessary stability and spatial organization to develop bacterial communities that rely more on communication and cooperation among different species when compared to more recently disturbed soils. Experiments will combine molecular and bioinformatic approaches to study bacteria at fine scales using a low-disturbance method for isolating soil aggregates and a coupled game theory-ecosystem model to connect microbial behavior in soil aggregates to changes in biogeochemical cycling. The researchers will use a well-characterized restoration gradient in a prairie ecosystem, including cultivated sites, restored sites of varying age, and relic prairie with no cultivation history. The overarching goal of this study is to investigate microbial social interactions within soil aggregate communities and their impacts on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling at the ecosystem level. Specifically, the study will address two questions: (1) Do stable, biologically active microaggregates foster microbial communities with a higher potential for signaling and communication, with increased metabolic interdependence and division of labor? (2) How does the division of labor within an aggregate community affect ecosystem-level carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling? Metagenomic and transcriptomic data will be used to parameterize a coupled microbial dynamics-ecosystem model for investigating the roles of microbial social interactions in community assembly and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling in soils. The researchers will also train 3 graduate students and 12 undergraduates. This project will also strengthen a research collaboration between their university and The Nature Conservancy, where a graduate student will be trained in field sampling and aggregate sieving techniques through an immersive experience in conservation work. An artist will work with the researchers to develop a virtual reality program to disseminate results of this project to high school students and public visitors to the field site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

US portion of the collaborative effort will be co-funded by NSF OISE/OD and MPS/DMS (Mathematical Biology and Computational Mathematics programs).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop computational models and algorithms for analyzing epidemiological dynamics under conflict and post-conflict scenarios. The proposed approach harnesses the combined strengths of computational biology, mathematical epidemiology, statistics, and machine learning, aligning with modern trends of incorporating human behavior into epidemiological models. The primary goal is to develop epidemiological models that encompass the diverse biological and epidemiological factors of pre-conflict, active conflict, and post-conflict stages. These factors include (a) the dynamics of forced population movements and migrations? (b) population concentrations, particularly in high-density refuges such as shelters and refugee camps? (c) the robustness and expanse of supply networks, with an emphasis on medical provisions? (d) disruptions to healthcare services and infrastructure, including the deliberate targeting of medical establishments as a wartime tactic? (e) prevailing environmental determinants, inclusive of sanitation and water accessibility? and (f) wartime psychological ramifications, which can impact community behaviors, resilience, and compliance with health interventions. The scientific results of the project will provide a unified modeling approach to study and predict epidemiological dynamics under various catastrophic events and develop methods for the subsequent decision making. The resulted integrated modeling framework and software will aid faster resources allocation during conflict which will mitigate pandemics, save social resources and lives of individuals involved. <br/><br/>The project includes multiple interconnected aims. Aim 1. Developing Epidemiological Models Tailored to Conflict Zones where the focus will be the seamless integration of multi-faceted data sources. These will include surveillance records, demographic metrics, population density data, insights on health infrastructure and medical resources, environmental determinants, seasonal variations, and comprehensive psychological profiles outlining war-related psychological distress and trauma. Notably, the strategy will also introduce several innovative fractal methodologies tailored explicitly for epidemic contexts, all nested within the global modeling framework. Aim 2. Merging War-centric Epidemiological Models with Population Genetics Within a Phylodynamics Framework where the objective is to link the modeling framework conceptualized in Aim 1 with population genetics models that capture evolutionary trajectories of emergent viruses. This will be nested within a structured phylodynamics and phylogeographic framework. The approach will be one of the pioneering efforts towards development of host behavior-based phylodynamic models. Aim 3. Algorithms for Optimized Public Health Resource Location-Allocation based on merged war-centric epidemiological models will employ a multi-criterion optimization to support decision making for healthcare resource allocation in war and post-war settings. For example, due to hospital damages, the immediate and ongoing necessity is to geographically allocate portable hospitals in ways that provide maximum coverage and the highest availability for the population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology works on pathogens that contain DNA (?DNA pathogens?). This solution holds promise because the method can be used to generate vaccines against any DNA pathogen, making the technology a platform relevant in both human and animal health markets (e.g., companion animals and livestock). The resulting vaccines will not need to be kept cold during shipping and storage, so it will be easier to get vaccines to places around the world. This attribute, in addition to the rapidity with which pathogens can be readied for vaccine production, means that the technology has the potential to quickly address epidemics and combat vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide. Long term, the technology will be validated to generate bacterial vaccines, important for antibacterial resistance. This technology should be attractive to researchers and vaccine manufacturers.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a technology that uses the chemical centanamycin to damage the DNA of pathogens and thereby produce live-attenuated, replication-defective pathogens that can be used to make vaccines. Previous studies have incorporated data using human cytomegalovirus and other pathogens and have demonstrated that a treated pathogen can infect cells but not replicate due to damaged DNA. The platform promises two key technical innovations for the vaccine industry: 1) since the solution is DNA pathogen-agnostic, the technique shows promise across all DNA-containing pathogens and 2) vaccines made with centanamycin-treated pathogens may not need cold storage and shipping. This innovation alone would be significant for addressing vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of their most popular applications include data clustering, resource planning, and chip design. In theoretical computer science, several broadly-applicable algorithmic and complexity theoretic tools have originated from the study of CSPs. While traditional research on CSPs assumes that the entire input is available to the algorithm, the big data boom has necessitated studying these problems in newer models of computation that are well-suited for processing very large datasets that cannot entirely fit in the algorithm?s memory. One such well-studied model of computation is the streaming model where the input to the algorithm is provided as a stream of data, and the streaming algorithm must perform all its computations using limited memory, much smaller than the size of the stream. A particular CSP of interest is the Maximum Directed Cut (Max-DICUT) problem, which has emerged as a central problem in the study of CSPs in the streaming setting. Despite significant attention, many fundamental questions about Max-DICUT and other CSPs remain unanswered in the streaming model. This project aims to tackle some of these foundational problems and provide significant insights into the capabilities and the limitations of streaming algorithms in solving CSPs. This project also provides research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through a new course in advanced algorithms that will integrate topics from these research directions. The research and course materials produced as a result will be made accessible to a general audience.<br/><br/>In terms of research directions, most previous works focused on ?single-pass? streaming algorithms, where the algorithm is allowed only one pass through the stream and the order in which the data arrives is decided by a malicious adversary. While this works as an excellent model in theory, in practice, the algorithms often have additional ?help?. For example, they may be allowed multiple passes over the input or required to perform well only on inputs drawn from a certain distribution. They may also have access to quantum bits or a machine learning oracle that can predict the rest of the stream. In such scenarios, there may be algorithms that are exponentially more space efficient than the best single-pass algorithms. This project aims to design streaming algorithms for Max-DICUT and other CSPs in such more general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching idea behind NARS is to harness emerging concepts in origami-inspired deployable and reconfigurable structures for strategic, widespread and commercially viable applications in building infrastructure. These systems have the capacity to become transformative solutions for post-disaster recovery from - and adaptation to - climate change. NARS systems can offer several benefits including adaptable building plans, reusability, rapid assembly, automation in construction, and fabrication at distributed locations. The research program will establish simulation tools, design methods, experimental mechanics principles, smart financing models, and pertinent knowledge whose intent are accelerating and scaling nimble assembly, geometric adaptability, and reuse for modern construction. Virtual reality will be used to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of NARS to industry, government, and community stakeholders. The work will also contribute to the development and improvement of educational materials including: modules for a course that engages first-year students to pursue civil engineering with climate adaptable structures; lecture content for a graduate course focused on theory, analysis, and design for NARS-like systems; and graduate course use cases on contractual and financial innovation for sustainable infrastructure projects.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the project include exploring building system integration, structural mechanics, and infrastructure financing for NARS systems. The research will establish simulation tools that provide insights on the assembly process, load bearing capability, geometric adaptability, constructability, and the impact of performance indicators on financing of NARS. Inverse design and optimization of thick origami will discover modular and adaptable systems that integrate into modern building structures. The effort will establish new mechanics-based experimental methods to test: (a) adaptability, where a system is reshaped and/or repurposed for different loading scenarios, and (b) reusability, where a system is deconstructed and reassembled multiple times. An experimental program for the project will provide insight on the mechanics of thick origami consisting of panels and hinges. Finally, this project will establish models and methods to evaluate the lifecycle cost to construct modular and reusable structures. The work will uncover appropriate financing structures and public-private partnership contracting options for delivery, and generate insights on how broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) implications of NARS systems can reduce the cost-of-capital.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ULVZs are thin patches of material that sit on the Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB), which is at a depth of 2891 km (1796 miles).  As their name implies, ULVZs slow passing seismic waves by as much as 50%. This makes which makes them some of the most anomalous features of the Earth?s interior.  Several ULVZs are beneath some of Earth?s largest hot spot volcanoes, such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa.  Imaging of the Earth?s interior shows that hot rising materials, or mantle plumes, connect these volcanoes from ULVZs to the surface.  But the origin, lifetime, size, and composition of these ULVZs are not known, nor is their role in the formation of the mantle plumes. This project will provide greater details as to where these features exist, their formation and composition. This work analyzes two types of seismic waves sensitive to thin ULVZ layering that interact with and bounce off these ULVZ features.  The study focuses on an area beneath the western Pacific Ocean because of extensive seismic data coverage and known ULVZs in the region. The project will create a new seismic database built from public records and networks in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. This database will then enable imaging of ULVZ structures at the CMB using modern statistical capabilities.  Computer simulations of mantle flow will help interpret the formation, motion, and role in mantle processes of the ULVZs.  This project includes an annual outreach STEM event for K-8 students for the local community.  This event will include activities to teach about the mantle plumes that form Pacific Islands through hot spot volcanism.<br/><br/>Ultra-Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs) are structures with strongly reduced seismic velocities at Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB) which have been associated with or linked to hot-spot volcanism, Large Igneous Provinces, core-mantle interaction, downwelling subduction and Large-Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs) and thus are a critical component of global mantle dynamics. ULVZs are typically studied using waveform analysis of ULVZ-sensitive seismic probes (e.g., SPdKS, ScP, ScS), but previous studies suffer from large uncertainties in ULVZ parameters due to modeling trade-offs and lack a geophysical inference of ULVZs through rigorous parameter estimation.  This project will develop a transformative waveform inversion approach and apply it to characterize ULVZ properties including their seismic velocities, density, size, and shape. Specifically, the project will (1) collect a new database of ULVZ-sensitive ScP and PcP waveforms utilizing publicly available seismic array data as well as new data from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the International Monitoring System (IMS) arrays, (2) advance capabilities for full waveform Bayesian inversion for ULVZ properties to quantitatively distinguish regions with and without ULVZ structures (i.e., Bayesian model selection), and to perform joint inversion of ScP and PcP waveforms, (3) quantify the waveform effects from 2-D/3-D ULVZ structures, (4) search for additional, previously unlooked-for arrivals in the ScP wavefield consistent with 3-D ULVZ structure using array processing approaches, and (5) relate observed ULVZ localities and properties to lowermost mantle flow and dynamics through 3D geodynamic models.

All organisms contain enzymes that repair damaged DNA to protect the integrity of the genetic information. This research project will determine how a newly discovered DNA repair enzyme found in bacteria works to repair damage created by specific toxins, which some bacteria produce as defense mechanisms. Because of their toxicity, these bacteria-derived toxins often have antimicrobial and antitumor properties, making them important in agriculture, industry, and medicine. The project will benefit society by providing 1) undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in methods used to determine atomic structures of proteins that are important for discovery and innovation in biotechnology, 2) summer research opportunities to undergraduates of Fisk University, a nearby historically black college/university, 3) teaching and mentoring opportunities for all trainees, 4) exposure of high school students interested in STEM to biomedical research, and 5) community outreach. These activities are facilitated through a collaborative and inclusive training environment at the intersection of the College of Arts and Science and the School of Medicine at Vanderbilt University.<br/><br/>Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) are among the most cytotoxic forms of DNA damage because they covalently tether the two DNA strands and therefore interfere with DNA replication and transcription. A new ICL repair pathway was recently discovered in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, in which a DNA glycosylase liberates one of the crosslinked nucleobases from the DNA backbone. The bacterial ICL glycosylases belong to a family of uncharacterized proteins prevalent in antibiotic producers and pathogens. The PI?s laboratory discovered that E. coli YcaQ initiates an ICL repair pathway by unhooking chemically diverse ICLs, and characterized a related enzyme (AlkZ) that provides Streptomyces with self-resistance to the toxicity of one of its natural products, azinomycin B, by unhooking resulting azinomycin B-ICLs. The long-term goals of this project are to elucidate the ICL repair pathway in bacteria, to understand how microbes utilize DNA repair to protect against genotoxic natural products in nature and within the microbiome, and to discover new genotoxic agents with beneficial applications. The short-term goals are to understand the molecular basis for ICL unhooking by YcaQ and for the specificity of AlkZ-related enzymes for highly functionalized crosslinking and intercalating natural products, and to characterize the bioactivities of putative genotoxins. A multidisciplinary approach integrating structural biology, biochemistry, genetics, cell biology, and metabolomics will be employed to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences/Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry/Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are both central and local physiological mechanisms that operate to regulate blood flow in working muscle tissue.  Currently, there is no mechanism whereby the balance between central and local control can be assessed and optimized.   To assess these mechanisms, both cardiac and vascular function must be measured.  The proposed technology allows the combination of both sets of measures in an algorithm and testing procedure to assess cardiovascular functionality. With this information, training or treatment plans may be optimized to address the underlying limitations in achieving maximum performance.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an algorithm to assess cardiovascular function by calculating the determinants of working tissue flow during exercise.  Critical to this algorithm is the measurement of both central (neurological) and local (metabolic) control of blood flow.  This is achieved by measuring pulse arterial responses to restrictions in blood flow, using a blood pressure cuff, and to stimulation through exercise.  The proposed method assesses local dilation, autonomic constriction, and total cardiac function.  These measurements may be used to determine how well both the heart and the blood vessels are performing.  Exercise increases the output of the heart but the blood vessels in the working muscles need to relax to allow more blood to flow.  If an athlete trains to increase heart output but does not increase the ability to relax blood vessels, then they will not optimize working tissue flow and hence performance.  Using the proposed algorithm, it may be possible to tell the athlete where they are limited and how to train to improve that limitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dike ascent is often accompanied by small earthquakes and deformation of the ground surface which can be detected by ground-based, and in some cases space-based sensors. Not all dikes lead to eruptions; in some cases, they stall and the magma solidifies without erupting. To properly interpret seismic and deformation signals and provide societally-relevant eruption warnings, we must understand the physical and chemical processes that control how rapidly dikes ascend, the paths they take, and whether or not they make it to the surface. These processes include resistance and motion of the solid rock outside the dike, the flow of magma within the dike, fracture of the crust at the dike tip, and possible solidification of the magma as it cools during its journey toward the surface - all of which are interdependent. Segall, Lew, and their team will use sophisticated computational techniques together with ground deformation and earthquake data to model dike ascent in Hawaii, and to develop guidelines for using such data to forecast eruptions in Hawaii and at similar volcanoes worldwide.  This research will address one of the Grand Challenges in the National Academies ERUPT report to advance physics-based eruption forecasting. Accurate, high-fidelity models of dike propagation are key to understanding precursors to many eruptions and will ultimately facilitate forecasting at volcano observatories worldwide.<br/><br/>This project will leverage advances in computational methods that allow the numerical grid to adapt to the changing shape of the dike as it grows. These and other advances will allow them to address: the conditions (magma viscosity, background temperature gradient, reservoir pressure, volume, and compressibility) that permit a dike to reach the earth's surface; the time-dependent surface deformations and  seismicity-inducing stress perturbations that could be used in physics-based  eruption forecasting; and the factors that determine whether deep dikes are focused toward or bypass crustal reservoirs. Computed dike ascent histories and predicted surface deformation will be compared to observations of deformation and seismicity that precedes some eruptions, as well as with laboratory analog experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data will be collected from single subject credential program (SSCP) mathematics completers in their first five years of teaching in both high-need and non-high-need school districts in California. The results of the study will be used to generate recommendations for improving and strengthening the connections between credential and induction programs and initiatives to support long-term retention and effective, inclusive, and equitable mathematics teaching practices. <br/> <br/>This three-year project at San Jose State University includes partnerships with the following seven California State University (CSU) campuses: Cal Poly Pomona; CSU East Bay; CSU Long Beach; CSU Monterey Bay; CSU Sacramento; CSU San Marcos; and Fresno State University. A central focus of the project is to uncover successful pathways that enable teacher candidates and interns to move from universities into middle and high schools and to be retained as highly effective mathematics teachers. The conceptual framework includes the complex nature of teachers' enacted practices, collective self-study of teaching practice, and a social ecological model of factors that contribute to teacher retention. Four research questions will be addressed using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. First, what is the nature and quality of SSCP math completers' professional experiences in their classrooms and work environments in the first three years of teaching, and the various supports they receive to become effective, highly qualified mathematics teachers? Second, what factors motivate those in their fourth and fifth year of teaching to persist? Third, what factors shape the decisions of those who move to a different school or leave the teaching profession within the first five years? Fourth, to what extent are teacher characteristics, school demographics, and working conditions associated with teaching effectiveness and decision to stay, move, or leave? At least 500 SSCP mathematics completers will be recruited to complete a survey with the possibility of a follow-up individual interview. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

As we growth from a small embryo, cells are constantly growing, dividing, migrating, changing shapes and pulling on each other. Even as adults, our cells continue these processes to maintain body functions and heal in response to injury. All these activities rely on the cells? ability to generate and transmit forces. The actin cytoskeleton, a meshwork of small, dynamic filaments (actin) and molecular motors that exists inside each cell, is the main driver of force generation and propagation within cells and across tissues and organs.<br/><br/>All cells need a functional actin cytoskeleton to maintain their shapes, divide into new cells and drive morphogenesis during development. Without an optimally functioning actin cytoskeleton, cells? ability to migrate, differentiate, divide and respond to injury is compromised, leading to birth defects, cancers, fibrosis, immunodeficiencies, etc. To fully understand these processes, we need to first understand how the actin cytoskeleton works as a function of its components (motors, filaments and crosslinkers), and how it generates and transmits forces within and between cells. Elucidation of the actin cytoskeleton?s activities from a molecular (bottom up) view, is imperative in order to provide a mechanistic understanding of all its associated cell processes and provide new therapeutic targets related to cytoskeletal dysfunction.<br/><br/>Experimental cell biology and in vitro studies have revealed many aspects of actin cytoskeleton contraction, such as the movement of molecular motors, the actin and motor organization underneath cell membranes (the cortex), and their role during cell division. However, many important questions that must be addressed are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to probe with experiments alone. These include: 1) What are the multiple mechanisms that the actin cytoskeleton use to contract?; 2) What makes one contraction mechanism dominant over the others?; 3) How much force can a network produce?; and 4) How do adjacent networks interact?<br/>Fortunately, there have been dramatic recent improvements in computer power and simulation methodologies that now allow us to conduct in silico, computational experiments that circumvent wet lab constraints, opening novel ways to probe and uncover hidden aspects of actin dynamics not previously accessible. This project takes advantage of these improvements with a novel, systematic series of theoretical and computational studies of cytoskeletal dynamics using state-of-the-art simulation techniques and new approaches developed in the Principal Investigator laboratory. This project is divided into two scientific tasks that leverage our group?s expertise in physics. The first aim is to model all three main actin contraction mechanisms (filament buckling, polarity sorting, and depolymerization end-tracking) and ask under which conditions each becomes dominant over the others and when synergistic and antagonistic effects arise. Results from this task will serve as a guide to determine the underlying contraction mechanism in different cells and the degree to which different perturbations would enhance or impart its function. In the second aim the Principal Investigator will investigate how much force actin networks can produce, sustain over time, and transmit to adjacent networks. Current studies focus mostly on contraction rates, which does not provide a sufficient picture for the long-term effects of actin contraction. This new approach will help fill the gap between the cytoskeleton?s internal dynamics and large-scale cell behaviors. In addition, the Principal Investigator will also implement an educational plan consisting activities targeted to different groups: (i) a summer workshop on modelling cytoskeletal systems opened for the whole scientific community; (ii) a special topics course on physics of the cytoskeletal for seniors and graduate students at North Carolina State University; and (iii) a K-12 outreach activity to teach STEM concepts using archery. <br/><br/>These three interrelated tasks are designed to address fundamental questions of high relevance in the physics of living systems. Completion of these tasks will provide a solid theoretical foundation of the inner workings of the actin cytoskeleton and pave the way for realistic models of in vivo systems, allowing us to study actin-associated cellular processes and diseases from a mechanistic point of view.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving and sustaining net-zero emissions requires advanced materials and methods for long-term sequestration of anthropogenic CO2. The production of concrete materials through binder carbonation has the potential to consume approximately one billion tons of CO2 annually. The application of carbonated concrete materials can also largely reduce CO2 emissions from the production of ordinary portland cement. Despite the major technological developments related to carbonated concrete materials in recent decades, the expanded use of these eco-friendly materials in structural and non-structural applications depends on addressing the chemical, physical, and processing related barriers. This research will focus on micro-engineering the carbonation process using sustainable performance-enhancing additives that will be exploited to design a range of microstructures for the carbonated concrete materials. It will attempt to design next-generation high-performance carbon-sink concrete with superior mechanical and durability properties to satisfy or surpass performance requirements for building and infrastructure applications in different geographic regions. The educational objectives of this work will complement the research goals by advancing knowledge on climate change and the importance of sustainable construction practices in Philadelphia high schools and colleges, as well as in the professional community by developing Sustainable Infrastructure Workshops, Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Team Competitions, and Sustainable Concrete Seminars. The education plan aims to enhance the diversity of the STEM workforce through strategic targeting and recruiting of underrepresented students.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this research is to micro-engineer the carbonation process using hybrid polymers that can perform multiple functions: (i) serve as internal CO2 sources to extend the process; (ii) regulate local pH to sustain the precipitation of carbonates; and (iii) serve as carbonate nucleation/growth sites to alter the kinetics and products of the process. The multi-functional hybrid polymers will be exploited to design a range of microstructures to link microstructure characteristics to the physical properties of carbonated materials. These fundamental relationships will be employed to predict the long-term performance of carbonated concrete materials in different environments and under various loading conditions. This research will attempt to advance the specific state-of-the-art in carbonated concrete materials and more broadly carbon capture technologies from several major scientific and technological perspectives such as: 1) uncovering the functioning mechanism of hybrid polymers using coupled in-situ synchrotron techniques, 2) developing novel advanced analytical techniques for studying carbonation reaction and microstructure evolution in carbonated concrete systems across length scales, and 3) developing efficient sustainable additives to engineer carbonated concrete materials from the bottom-up.

One major source of ?hidden? diversity may be the many mites, nematodes, fungi, and protist symbionts that live inside insects. Such organisms are known to have associations with insects but detecting their presence and quantifying their diversity pose major challenges. This is a potentially massive oversight toward an understanding of global species diversity: if insect-associated symbionts are also often specialized on just one or a few species of insect, this would imply the existence of millions of undescribed and uncounted species, requiring a revision of global species richness estimates. This research will lead to the development of new methods to reveal the eukaryotic symbionts living inside insects. It will also apply those methods to the most ambitious surveys of insect-symbiont diversity to date, spanning two natural insect communities in two different habitats. The research will be integrated into public events in Iowa and Ohio where participants will learn about biodiversity and participate in sampling insects to be used in the research. A major theme will be how much diversity may be hiding even in our own backyards. This project will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students on two campuses, one which is a primarily undergraduate-serving institution. Students will participate in the proposed research but will also receive valuable mentoring in teaching and scientific outreach.<br/><br/>The researchers will develop PCR blocking primers that inhibit amplification of 18S rRNA from the five largest orders of insects (representing >75% of all described insect species) but that permit amplification of 18S rRNA from any other eukaryote in a sample. They will also iteratively design blocking primers for large and/or common symbiont groups detected in natural samples so that smaller/rare symbionts may also be detected. These methods will allow detection of any eukaryotic symbiont associated with insects in the five largest orders (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera). Two first-of-their-kind symbiont diversity surveys will apply the developed methods to >1000 insects collected from each of two natural communities, interrogating all insect hosts for eukaryotic symbionts. Preliminary data show that blockers are effective at greatly reducing host insect DNA amplification and successfully detect mites, nematodes, fungi, and even single-celled apicomplexan protists associated with individual insects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, people vary in how much their emotions change with stress. This is called ""daily affective reactivity to stress."" Having greater affective reactivity is associated with poor outcomes including worse well-being, higher risks of mental and physical health problems, and dying earlier. This project investigates whether and how experiences during childhood, such as experiencing maltreatment and stress or receiving high quality parenting, predict daily affective reactivity to stress in adulthood. This project also investigates how the use of coping strategies in adulthood, such as seeking support, exercising, or using drugs or alcohol, might change or explain the links between childhood experiences and daily affective reactivity to stress in adulthood. The research informs the design of effective interventions for helping people respond constructively to daily stress. <br/><br/>This project builds on the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation, a longitudinal study that has followed a sample of people born into poverty for over 50 years. Now, with participants at age 50, this project has them complete 14 daily surveys reflecting on the stressful events that occur each day and how they respond in terms of positive and negative affect, support seeking, substance use, and exercise. These data are used to test whether early experiences predict daily affective reactivity to stress by looking at measures of maltreatment, life stress, and maternal sensitivity that were collected during the participants? infancy and childhood. Two competing theoretical models of how early experiences shape adult stress reactivity are tested. The stress sensitization model proposes that adverse early experiences lead to greater reactivity to stressors in adulthood, with positive early experiences having protective effects. The stress inoculation model proposes that individuals with very high or very low early adversity will be more reactive to stress in adulthood, and individuals who experience moderate early adversity will be less reactive to stress. Detailed analyses of moderation and mediation effects determine whether tendencies to engage in support seeking, exercise, and substance use in response to stress change or explain links between early experiences and daily affective reactivity to stress.

A key tool in quantum computing, known as discrete quantum walks, can be used to build quantum circuits and model a number of quantum algorithms including Grover's search. While advantages of discrete quantum walks become clear through numerical evidence, a unified, graph-theoretical framework that allows researchers to prove these advantages is missing. To bridge the gap, this project addresses the following question: how is the behavior of a discrete quantum walk determined by the combinatorial properties of the underlying graph? Answers to this question will help pinpoint graphs on which discrete quantum walks exhibit advantages, and ultimately lead to new constructions of quantum-walk-based algorithms. Broader impacts of this project include quantum-inspired transformations in AI technology, biomedical research, climate science, optimization, financial modelling, and training of a diverse workforce in quantum science and technology.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to prove (or disprove) certain phenomena in discrete quantum walks using graph theory and algebra. Prior work by the investigator has revealed spectral relations between the transition matrix of a discrete quantum walk and the incidence matrices of various combinatorial structures. Built upon these relations, this project will (1) offer characterizations of graphs that are ""spectrally nice"" to enable desired quantum phenomena, such as high-fidelity state transfer and uniform mixing, (2) establish connections between discrete quantum walks and continuous quantum walks, which are physically different but share transferable mathematical machinery, and (3) identify test cases for discrete-quantum-walk approaches to hard combinatorial problems, thereby assessing their effectiveness. Outcomes of this project will not only advance scientific understanding of quantum walks, but also enrich educational experience by incorporating these findings into future quantum computing courses and engaging students in mentoring activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, these forests have been affected by an increase in fires, caused in part by warmer summers and less snow in the spring. These fires emit large amounts of smoke which can be blown by winds northward to the Arctic. Once this smoke gets to the Arctic, it can both cool the climate by reflecting sunlight, but also warm it (if the smoke is nearer the surface, or if the small smoke particles reach the ice and snow on the surface, as they can darken it and absorb more sunlight). As we expect temperatures to continue to warm everywhere on the planet, it is likely that large boreal fires will continue and even become more common. We plan to study the impact that the smoke may have on Arctic climate and sea ice using climate models. In the past, these climate models have not taken into consideration an increase in these boreal fires, and our work will help us determine if this is an important process to get right for understanding future changes in Arctic climate and sea ice. As we prepare for the next generation of climate models that help inform the United Nations? panel on climate change, our results will also help highlight the importance boreal forest fires may have for climate change in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Biomass burning from boreal forest fires can impact Arctic climate and sea ice via the atmospheric transport of aerosols, particularly black carbon, from source regions into the Arctic. While in the atmosphere, aerosols can have either a positive (warming) or negative (cooling) radiative forcing, depending on their elevation. Black carbon can also be deposited onto the sea ice or snow at the surface, where it has a positive radiative forcing because it darkens it and absorbs more sunlight. While fully coupled climate models simulate these processes, the amount of biomass burning is prescribed as a set forcing. In the most recent set of climate model runs that help inform the United Nations? panel on climate change, simulations from 2015 to 2100 used fixed projections of boreal biomass burning emissions that did not anticipate an increase in forest fires. However, in the real world we have observed a dramatic increase in boreal biomass burning over the last 10 years, in part due to warmer summers and reduced spring snow cover (which itself is driven by warmer springs), and the emissions of black carbon are already more than double what the climate models used over 2015-2100. We plan to study the impact that an increase in boreal biomass burning has on Arctic climate and sea ice by running climate model simulations that prescribe an increase in aerosol emissions based on the recent observed growth in these fires. We also plan to study the impact that wind patterns have on the transport of smoke from boreal forest fires, as it is known that certain weather patterns can promote the likelihood of forest fires. This coupled interaction between weather and fires is currently missing in climate models, and our work will help us determine how important winds, in addition to the amount, severity and seasonality of fires are in determining how much black carbon is transported into the Arctic. Our results will serve to inform stakeholders of the importance of boreal forests for Arctic climate in the coming decades. As the community prepares for the next round of climate model simulations, our results will help inform the modeling community on the importance of both increasing boreal forest fires and the interaction of fires and winds on Arctic climate and sea ice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its deformation under external forces depends on the extent and speed of loading. Rapid deformation of the brain during events such as blasts and automotive crashes can cause traumatic brain injury. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the human brain under such extreme conditions is critical to developing computer models for predicting brain injury. This knowledge is also needed to design safer personal protective equipment and brain injury management and prevention strategies. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the mechanical behavior of living humans' brains is restricted to small deformations and a narrow range of loading rates that do not represent the full spectrum of injury-causing conditions. This award supports fundamental research combining high-rate mechanical testing, analytical and computational modeling, and machine learning to generate insights into how the living human brain responds to large and rapid loading. Results from this research will positively impact U.S. national health and welfare and will contribute to the fields of tissue mechanics, traumatic brain injury, and machine learning. This project will lead to new courses and involve contributions from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the high strain rate mechanics of the brain in its native biophysical environment. The first stage will focus on tissue responses under small deformations and dynamic strain rates. Wide-band Magnetic Resonance Elastography experiments will be conducted on brain tissue specimens from multiple brain regions to develop linear viscoelastic constitutive models. Multi-fidelity models will be developed to fuse the observed responses with available narrow-band in vivo brain tissue responses for predicting linear viscoelastic properties of the in vivo brain tissue in a wide range of loading frequencies. The second stage will focus on tissue responses under large deformations and extreme strain rates. Quasi-static and dynamic mechanical testing will be conducted to develop visco-hyperelastic constitutive models.

This is the 8th edition of an annual conference series co-organized by faculty from the University of Kansas (KU), the University of Missouri (MU), the University of Nebraska (NU) and, more recently, Iowa State University (ISU).  Nearly all physical phenomena are governed by fundamental laws and design principles that directly relate rates of change of the various quantities involved to one another. This powerful underlying concept leads naturally to differential equations, which are widely used as models in mathematical physics and have applications to a wide range of fields including Bose-Einstein condensates, fluid dynamics, pattern formation, gas dynamics, and fiber optical communications. This conference will bring together researchers from the broader geographic region around Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa to report new results and exchange ideas on differential equations and their applications. Building on the success of the prior seven conferences in this conference series, the conference will provide a venue for regional junior and senior researchers, as well as graduate students, to discuss recent advances and challenges in their respective fields. Additionally, early-career researchers will be given the opportunity to present their work and to gain insight into state-of-the-art results and associated techniques through interactions with senior experts in the field.<br/><br/>Complex nonlinear systems abound in science and engineering, and their behavior is often modeled by systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). Any progress towards understanding the behavior of the solutions to PDE is of paramount importance for a variety of practical applications, including fluid flow, flame front propagation and fiber optical communications. Many PDE can be conveniently described as infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, allowing for the use of tools and methodologies from the theory of dynamical systems to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the solutions of these systems. Objects like invariant manifolds have been a great aid in understanding the behavior of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, but identifying the connections between nonlinear PDE and dynamical systems is still a very active direction of current research. In the last few decades, collaborations between researchers in these fields, as well as with those working in their applications, have provided tremendous progress in our understanding of the dynamical behavior, stability, and robustness of coherent structures in such nonlinear PDE.  The themes of this conference include (i) fluid dynamics, water waves and dispersive PDE, (ii) existence, dynamics, and stability of nonlinear waves in dissipative systems, and (iii) completely integrable systems and their applications. These themes are well represented by the regional experts as well as the invited plenary speakers.

Its deformation under external forces depends on the extent and speed of loading. Rapid deformation of the brain during events such as blasts and automotive crashes can cause traumatic brain injury. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the human brain under such extreme conditions is critical to developing computer models for predicting brain injury. This knowledge is also needed to design safer personal protective equipment and brain injury management and prevention strategies. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the mechanical behavior of living humans' brains is restricted to small deformations and a narrow range of loading rates that do not represent the full spectrum of injury-causing conditions. This award supports fundamental research combining high-rate mechanical testing, analytical and computational modeling, and machine learning to generate insights into how the living human brain responds to large and rapid loading. Results from this research will positively impact U.S. national health and welfare and will contribute to the fields of tissue mechanics, traumatic brain injury, and machine learning. This project will lead to new courses and involve contributions from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the high strain rate mechanics of the brain in its native biophysical environment. The first stage will focus on tissue responses under small deformations and dynamic strain rates.

The main tool used in this project will be a quantity called spectral sensitivity, which has recently been used in several major advances in query complexity. Query complexity has been a useful tool in helping understand the answers to questions such as to what extent access to randomness or quantum computers can make computer programs more efficient.

The first considers relationships between block sensitivity and sensitivity, and between sensitivity and degree. These are complexity measures that are useful in understanding the different models of query complexity including deterministic, randomized, and quantum.  The second considers the query complexity of the composition of functions, which can reveal how the value of complexity measures can change when functions are combined. Finally, the project will also consider the communication complexity of certain classes of functions.

PFAS are one of the world?s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS present a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. In the US, impending drinking water regulations and listing of PFAS as hazardous substances under Superfund are setting the enforcement foundation for aggressive cleanup of PFAS-contaminated sites. Current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream. This project focuses on the development of a low cost, chemical-free water treatment system that directly mineralizes PFAS to safe end-products with no secondary PFAS waste generation.  It addresses customers? need to achieve environmental compliance, reduce remediation cost, accelerate site closeout, and prevent future environmental pollution and liability.<br/><br/><br/>This project is technically focused on the electrolytic destruction of PFAS. The core technology consists of a novel radial-field flow unit cell architecture with an array of these unit cells stacked into an Electrolyzer. Contaminants are destroyed as the groundwater passes through the Electrolyzer anode compartments. Key innovations of this treatment system include the scalability of the unit cells to very large area electrodes resulting in large-scale Electrolyzer stacks that handle continuous water flow, and most importantly the development of a low-cost, anode electrocatalyst that provides high voltage, single-step mineralization of PFAS, including the long chains and hard to treat short-chains, to safe end-products. The objectives of this project are: (1) Scale up the anode electrocatalyst coating process for large area 3D electrodes and make full-scale, low cost anodes; (2) Design and build an Electrolyzer Stack composed of an array of repeating, scaled-up unit cells; (3) Construct a groundwater treatment skid with the Electrolyzer Stack and perform on-site groundwater PFAS remediation treatability testing; (4) Verify the PFAS destruction efficiency and low cost of the Electrolyzer Stack water treatment system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Steady growth in human population and rapid industrial development have led to greater demands for water production. At the same time, anthropogenic activities, agricultural practices, and the disposal of wastewater have led to salinization of natural freshwater resources. The desalination battery combines the functions of desalination and energy generation to reduce the energy and costs associated with desalination, addressing challenges at the intersection of the water-energy nexus. The goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the commercialization of the desalination battery by evaluating the effects of various solution components present in real feedwater types on the performance of the desalination battery. Successful development of the desalination battery will help to safeguard access to freshwater resources and ensure an adequate freshwater supply, which are essential to advance the health and welfare of the American public. <br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to commercialize a new desalination technology, a desalination battery, which is based on the patented use of Bi as a Cl-storage electrode in combination with a Na-storage electrode.

As the energy consumed during charging is recovered during discharging, the net energy required for desalination is drastically reduced. Furthermore, since Na+ and Cl- are removed via ion-specific electrode reactions, the desalination battery enables membrane-free desalination. While efficient removal of NaCl has been demonstrated, the effects of various other solution components present in real wastewater and seawater are still unknown. The goal of the proposed work is to accurately evaluate the effects of different salinities, pH conditions, and various inorganic and organic species present in real feedwater on the performance of the desalination battery and develop mitigation plans for any problematic components.

This study will provide the first test of whether microbial social interactions lead to impacts in function at the ecosystem level using microbial communities from both natural grassland and agricultural soil. Communication in the form of chemical signals that can be detected by bacteria will influence whether cells will make various extracellular enzymes that degrade plant matter. The social organization of these bacterial communities could allow for a division of labor, with some species contributing one set of enzymes and other species contributing different ones, thereby increasing the efficiency of organic matter decomposition. In this way, social interactions among bacteria could influence how well the entire ecosystem works. The research will also provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Students will gain experience in field, lab, and computational techniques, including bioinformatics and mathematical modeling approaches that link game theory to ecological processes, and will participate in outreach to high school science students and their teacher. <br/><br/>In soil, bacteria are most likely to interact with other bacteria within clumps of soil particles known as aggregates. Aggregates give soil a structure, which helps water and oxygen flow, protects carbon in soil, and supports diverse communities of microorganisms. These microbes decompose dead plants and animals, recycle nutrients, and help new plants to thrive. Soil that is mechanically disturbed, for example by plowing, loses many of its aggregates and overall structure. This team of researchers hypothesize that soil aggregates, like those found in prairie soils that have not been farmed for many years, will provide the necessary stability and spatial organization to develop bacterial communities that rely more on communication and cooperation among different species when compared to more recently disturbed soils. Experiments will combine molecular and bioinformatic approaches to study bacteria at fine scales using a low-disturbance method for isolating soil aggregates and a coupled game theory-ecosystem model to connect microbial behavior in soil aggregates to changes in biogeochemical cycling. The researchers will use a well-characterized restoration gradient in a prairie ecosystem, including cultivated sites, restored sites of varying age, and relic prairie with no cultivation history. The overarching goal of this study is to investigate microbial social interactions within soil aggregate communities and their impacts on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling at the ecosystem level. Specifically, the study will address two questions: (1) Do stable, biologically active microaggregates foster microbial communities with a higher potential for signaling and communication, with increased metabolic interdependence and division of labor? (2) How does the division of labor within an aggregate community affect ecosystem-level carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling? Metagenomic and transcriptomic data will be used to parameterize a coupled microbial dynamics-ecosystem model for investigating the roles of microbial social interactions in community assembly and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling in soils. The researchers will also train 3 graduate students and 12 undergraduates. This project will also strengthen a research collaboration between their university and The Nature Conservancy, where a graduate student will be trained in field sampling and aggregate sieving techniques through an immersive experience in conservation work. An artist will work with the researchers to develop a virtual reality program to disseminate results of this project to high school students and public visitors to the field site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Don Tilley of the University of California, Berkeley will study new structures and reactions of chemical compounds that incorporate both a transition metal and silicon. Discoveries in this area are expected to provide new compounds and chemical transformations that accelerate emerging applications of silicon-based materials, which include silicone polymers, adhesives, lubricants, and semiconductors. A primary objective is the study of a little understood type of chemical compound that features silicon atoms bonded only to metal centers. Such compounds are expected to exhibit properties that have yet to be thoroughly explored, but promise to aid the improvement of industrial processes. In addition, this program prepares graduate and undergraduate students for careers in science by providing a research environment that fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skill development. There is an important educational-outreach component that include work with transfer students to ease their entry into the Berkeley program. Students will participate in outreach programs that include hosting high school students and engaging with local elementary schools to teach basic scientific principles through interactive lessons. There is a long standing strong record of training of research students; this training includes preparing students to work with challenging chemicals and reagents.<br/><br/>Complexes that formally possess a multiple bond between a metal and silicon, such as silylene complexes (LnM=SiRR'), have attracted considerable interest over the years, for their assumed or established role in catalytic processes such as silylene-transfer or hydrosilylation. The focus of this project will center on  development of a better understanding of chemical properties associated with multiple bonding, with three primary aims designed to (1) expand the knowledge base for metal silylene complexes formally possessing M=Si double bonds, (2) explore a new class of compounds ? molecular silicide complexes with M=Si=M cores, and (3) develop informative, periodic relationships to metal-element multiple bonds involving the heavier group 14 elements germanium, tin, and lead. A central objective will be establishing principles that govern formation and transformations of the molecular silicides, containing metal-ligated silicon atoms. For comparison, solid-state metal silicides are of immense technological importance as catalysts that make and break bonds to silicon, as in the direct process for the synthesis of organosilanes from elemental silicon. Despite the technological importance of transition-metal silicides, little is known about their reaction mechanisms and this knowledge gap makes it difficult to design processes that utilize silicides as synthetic intermediates. Molecular silicides should be amenable to mechanistic investigation and development of homogeneous transformations of silicon compounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communities rely heavily on social service organizations to not only fulfill service needs but to successfully refer community members in need to appropriate services. This requires that each service provider have an accurate understanding of the larger landscape of service providers, what services they can provide, and to whom, at any point in time. We have identified a number of fundamental challenges that these organizations face with regard to the collection and sharing of relevant information.  They include keeping information up-to-date, finding time to capture concrete and tacit knowledge, and identifying key holders of knowledge in the organization, just to name a few.  This project will examine the potential for the current advances in AI technology to be applied to help social service organizations become more efficient in support of the most vulnerable members of our communities.  It will push the boundaries of understanding human-AI partnerships and will result in algorithmic advances in heterogeneous network modeling, social science advances in understanding the factors behind the uptake of AI technology, and interface advances in understanding the most effective means for social workers to engage with AI to capture, maintain, and leverage information in their everyday work. <br/><br/>The challenges of social service providers mirror those seen in large commercial organizations which often refer to them as challenges of knowledge management and transfer (KM/KT).  We hypothesize that KM/KT innovations can be successfully applied to the social services sector, drastically improving service in our communities and that the introduction of a KM/KT framework among the distributed social service organizations within a local community will provide a unique opportunity to establish an artificial intelligence (AI) layer to leverage that knowledge and amplify the efforts of local service providers.  We will develop a proof-of-concept unified data framework for local social service providers to capture and share relevant service information and documents (excluding any personal client information).  Over this framework, we will develop an AI layer capable of summarizing and classifying documents, identifying relevant knowledge holders, extracting important information (e.g. dates, eligibility requirements), and creating a complex heterogeneous network model of the social services landscape  ? all tasks that when combined with service provider expertise, can enhance the services offered across the local social services landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each summer, 8 students will participate in a 9-week program focused on research and including additional professional development and outreach activities. As faculty at an institution specializing in undergraduate research, the REU mentors are experienced in transforming students from tentative beginners into confident scientists. The program particularly targets beginning students and community college students and prepares and motivates them for future careers in science through a direct, mentored research experience. A welcoming and collaborative environment provides a place for students who have been marginalized in the STEM community to thrive. The program's range of research areas provides an intellectual home for students who use experimental and computational methods to explore interdisciplinary topics across materials science, physics, and chemistry. Projects address systems and phenomena across vastly different scales, ranging from molecules to galaxies. Through engaging students in these projects and professional development, the program results in broadening educational access, developing professional interest in STEM, and increasing the competitiveness of the American workforce.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The broad goal of the College of Wooster REU program is to create an atmosphere conducive to high-quality science in a vibrant research community where students increase their confidence and sense of belonging.  Through a balance of experiment, computation, and theory, the REU site advances knowledge in the fields of condensed matter, granular matter, soft matter physics, optics, chemical physics, pattern formation, sol-gels, and astrophysics.  Research students in granular matter develop video analysis techniques to characterize the avalanche dynamics on a critical pile of beads to investigate universal scaling laws. Other students measure the thermodynamic properties of swellable organically modified silica, a ""swellable glass"" that absorbs many times its own mass in organic liquids like acetone and has applications in industrial and environmental remediation. Using recent images from the James Webb Space Telescope, astrophysics researchers investigate the evolution of clumpy galaxies.  All research projects are designed so that even novice undergraduates can make significant scientific contributions. They become practicing scientists through research, oral and poster presentations, and comprehensive written reports. After the end of the program, faculty continue mentoring student participants to prepare conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications together. As part of continual improvement of mentoring and student training, the program leaders also will develop a framework to explicitly expand students' scientific argumentation skills. These tools for developing and assessing student critical thinking skills in scientific argumentation will be useful to other programs seeking to bring effective, high-quality research mentoring to a broader, more diverse student population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ULVZs are thin patches of material that sit on the Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB), which is at a depth of 2891 km (1796 miles).  As their name implies, ULVZs slow passing seismic waves by as much as 50%. This makes which makes them some of the most anomalous features of the Earth?s interior.  Several ULVZs are beneath some of Earth?s largest hot spot volcanoes, such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa.  Imaging of the Earth?s interior shows that hot rising materials, or mantle plumes, connect these volcanoes from ULVZs to the surface.  But the origin, lifetime, size, and composition of these ULVZs are not known, nor is their role in the formation of the mantle plumes. This project will provide greater details as to where these features exist, their formation and composition. This work analyzes two types of seismic waves sensitive to thin ULVZ layering that interact with and bounce off these ULVZ features.  The study focuses on an area beneath the western Pacific Ocean because of extensive seismic data coverage and known ULVZs in the region. The project will create a new seismic database built from public records and networks in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. This database will then enable imaging of ULVZ structures at the CMB using modern statistical capabilities.  Computer simulations of mantle flow will help interpret the formation, motion, and role in mantle processes of the ULVZs.  This project includes an annual outreach STEM event for K-8 students for the local community.  This event will include activities to teach about the mantle plumes that form Pacific Islands through hot spot volcanism.<br/><br/>Ultra-Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs) are structures with strongly reduced seismic velocities at Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB) which have been associated with or linked to hot-spot volcanism, Large Igneous Provinces, core-mantle interaction, downwelling subduction and Large-Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs) and thus are a critical component of global mantle dynamics. ULVZs are typically studied using waveform analysis of ULVZ-sensitive seismic probes (e.g., SPdKS, ScP, ScS), but previous studies suffer from large uncertainties in ULVZ parameters due to modeling trade-offs and lack a geophysical inference of ULVZs through rigorous parameter estimation.  This project will develop a transformative waveform inversion approach and apply it to characterize ULVZ properties including their seismic velocities, density, size, and shape. Specifically, the project will (1) collect a new database of ULVZ-sensitive ScP and PcP waveforms utilizing publicly available seismic array data as well as new data from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the International Monitoring System (IMS) arrays, (2) advance capabilities for full waveform Bayesian inversion for ULVZ properties to quantitatively distinguish regions with and without ULVZ structures (i.e., Bayesian model selection), and to perform joint inversion of ScP and PcP waveforms, (3) quantify the waveform effects from 2-D/3-D ULVZ structures, (4) search for additional, previously unlooked-for arrivals in the ScP wavefield consistent with 3-D ULVZ structure using array processing approaches, and (5) relate observed ULVZ localities and properties to lowermost mantle flow and dynamics through 3D geodynamic models. This is a collaborative proposal between scientists at the University of Utah, Arizona State University, and Leeds University, and is therefore co-funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United Kingdom?s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecosystems are complex communities of species that have evolved with each other and their shared environment over long periods of time. Understanding how these systems change over time is a Grand Challenge in Biology that is made urgent and policy-relevant by rapid climate change. This is particularly true in the Arctic, which is warming at least three times faster than the global average. Arctic ecosystems are uniquely suited to their extreme environment, and they provide food and livelihoods for human communities. It is critical to know whether species and ecosystems can evolve to match the pace of change, or whether they might fall apart or muddle along in a reduced state. EvoME will bring together experts from across biological disciplines to generate new insights at every scale, from genes to landscapes. It will document natural responses of multiple species in rivers and streamside tundra environments and conduct large-scale experiments on the flow of energy and genes between ecosystems. EvoME will foster a new generation of biologists trained to think and work across disciplines, with special attention to increasing inclusion and retention of researchers from underrepresented backgrounds, by a cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional course, a research fund for students, and a Fellows program. Finally, it will bring journalists into the research process to create?and help researchers create?innovative media and stories through blogs, social media, and radio stories that bring EvoME?s integrated understanding to public audiences, including rural and Alaska Native communities.<br/><br/>The EvoME Institute integrates across biological disciplines and scales of organization to understand how adaptive evolution maintains and shapes ecosystems linked by the flow of evolving organisms and energy (the meta-ecosystem) in response to climate change. New evidence that evolution can occur rapidly necessitates a major reappraisal of the longstanding paradigm that ecosystem and meta-ecosystem resilience can be understood without evolution. EvoME advances eco-evolutionary theory and understanding by integrating from genes to meta-ecosystems to understand how each biological level interacts with the others. In doing so, this institute addresses fundamental questions in genomics, molecular genetics, evolution, physiology, behavior, population and community ecology, and ecosystem biology in the most rapidly warming place on Earth. EvoME will evaluate the current adaptive capacity of key species that integrate Arctic ecosystems along a latitudinal gradient in northern Alaska, including leveraging insights from populations living in hot springs in the Arctic. EvoME will conduct metaecosystem experiments that manipulate energy (litter and insect migration inclusion/exclusion) and gene (transplant and common garden) flow in river/riparian systems. It will combine this information with powerful whole-genome assessments and models to disentangle the processes through which food web responses interact with evolution and alter underlying trait and ecosystem responses. EvoME also will develop novel bio-monitoring equipment, computational algorithms, and new modeling techniques to develop flexible and adaptable forecasting tools. In these ways, EvoME will contribute to a broader, mechanistic, and predictive understanding of the joint ecological and evolutionary responses of Earth?s meta-ecosystems to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar cells, which absorb sunlight and generate electricity, are playing and will continue to play a strong role in reducing the demand for fossil-fuel derived energy. Solar cells constructed out of organic molecules or polymers are of interest because they are inexpensive, easy to process, lightweight and flexible. The electric power generated by today?s organic solar cells is limited because of thermodynamic constraints. There is currently intense scientific effort to overcome these constraints and to construct solar cells that yield higher power. A promising approach is to use singlet fission, a photophysical process within which the electrical current generated by light absorption is in principle doubled. Practical utilization of singlet fission requires further research. Charge generation here occurs in two steps, and while impressive success has been reached in the development of chromophores in which the first step is very efficient, in nearly all cases the second step takes too long, and electric charge, and so, energy, is lost to the process of recombination. The PI will perform quantum chemical calculations that will lead to new molecular materials in which the second step of singlet fission, charge separation, will occur ultrafast, leading to organic solar cells with higher quantum efficiencies. A significant portion of the research is in collaboration with groups that specialize in experimental research on singlet fission. The broader impacts of this work include interdisciplinary training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, outreach efforts fostering interest in chemistry and physics among members of underserved groups, and increased scientific literacy and public awareness.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the process of singlet fission in organic solar cell materials. Research on singlet fission until recently focused on designing materials that give rapid singlet to triplet-triplet conversion. Rapid triplet-triplet generation; however, is a consequence of strong interchromophore coupling that also leads to strong triplet-triplet multiexciton binding and fast triplet recombination instead of generation of free triplets. Overcoming this impasse requires clear understanding of the relationship between bonding motifs and the generation of triplet-triplet multiexcitons with weak binding energy, that have been discovered recently in different families of intramolecular singlet fission materials. The PI will perform high order multiple reference configuration interaction-calculations within the semiempirical Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian using a diagrammatic exciton basis that will yield precise structure-property correlations with predictive capability. The goal of this research is to arrive at structural features that will give fast generation of free triplets in ultrafast times.

For example, natural biofilms are used to remove nitrate from wastewater. The long-term goal of this project is to design biofilms that can efficiently degrade polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), a major group of water contaminants that have health and environmental implications. The successful completion of the project will benefit society by providing fundamental knowledge of biofilms and biodegradation of PFAS, and creating the framework for future applications in manufacturing, energy and medicine. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through public engagement, education and training the next generation of scientists.  <br/><br/>Biofilms are mixed-species consortia that create structured microenvironments with distributed tasks and functions that confer significant survival advantages compared to planktonic cells. Although natural biofilms are readily used for wastewater treatment such as denitrification, little is known about how to purposefully create synthetic biofilms. This project aims to identify the design principles and establish the knowledge base as a framework for the development and manufacturing of use-inspired biofilms as robust structures for a range of applications. It is proposed to design environmentally safe synthetic biofilm consortia that can be incorporated into a bioreactor system for the efficient biodegradation of model polyfluorinated compounds known as PFAS that accumulate in the environment and are of increasing health and environmental concern and regulatory focus. Specifically, this project will (1) learn to design and control the formation of a robust artificial biofilm consortia composed of two bacterial species for (2) the efficient degradation of PFAS compounds that will be implemented on an easy to configure and cost-effective biofilm carrier system for future bioreactor operations (3). Molecular mechanisms will be interrogated and identified with which to manipulate the composition and properties of biofilms composed of engineered bacteria that are not typically associated with each other. Targeting PFAS degradation will create new innovative biocatalytic activities for the degradation of hard to biodegrade moieties that are recalcitrant funnel points of heavily used commercial agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals that enter our waterways. Knowledge and systems generated in this project will enable the design of new living biofilm materials for potentially transformational biotechnology processes beyond bioremediation, such as for biomanufacturing, energy and biomedical applications and as functional and/or responsive coatings. Education and outreach activities will be developed to broaden STEM participation and educate the public about biotechnological approaches and the use of genetically engineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two significant aspects of this activity are addressed by this project, namely the ability to process data at scale and to construct models that can accurately predict future behavior. The first aspect is connected to sublinear algorithms, which identify small subsets of data that accurately represent the entire dataset. The second aspect is connected to optimization methods to identify underlying models that best explain existing data. This project will discover new mathematical connections between these two aspects, and this interplay will lead to both faster optimization methods and better sublinear algorithms for fundamental problems of practical relevance. Furthermore, findings of this project will enhance curricula for advanced algorithms courses and will train future generations of graduate students.<br/><br/>Many data sets today can be characterized as collection of points in high-dimensional space, and models are functions defined over this domain. Property testing provides a rigorous approach towards inferring properties of these functions with a small sample. Optimization problems address methods to choose a point that maximizes or minimizes the function value. This project will address connections between these methods. In particular, the project uses optimization techniques for developing better property testers for canonical properties such as submodularity and (discrete) convexity, both long-standing fundamental open problems. In the other direction, the project uses techniques from property testing to design new robust algorithms for optimization problems. These methods have the potential to help explain why certain non-convex optimization problems are tractable although they are NP-hard in the worst case. This project will develop mathematical connections between algorithms and geometry, and these will be incorporated into lecture notes and expository material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Ku-Lung (Ken) Hsu from the University of Virginia to investigate how individual cells control the metabolism of fats and lipids. Dr. Hsu is developing novel chemical compounds that attach to enzymes (protein catalysts) to probe the metabolism of fats and lipids inside of cells. These probes illuminate how cells are similar or distinct based on their metabolic status. Uncovering distinctive metabolic identities within a massive assortment of cells shows how seemingly identical cells differentiate into specific cell types (e.g. a nerve versus a muscle cell). The metabolic signals discovered through these studies may enable the development of new cell types or properties to push the boundaries of cell engineering. Graduate students receive unique training in chemistry and chemical biology to foster their development as outstanding leaders and role models in society. The research project is integrated with an educational outreach program designed to broadly impact Native American students communities by teaching how lipid (bio)chemistry influences healthy food choices and eating behaviors in society.<br/><br/>This research program aims to understand metabolic regulation of cellular function at the single-cell level. The significance of the studies is to establish a fundamental understanding of how identical cells differentiate into functionally distinct cell lineages. The hypothesis is that metabolism imparts asymmetry by providing essential chemical signals that specify a cell's function and fate. Small molecule reporters are integrated with flow cytometry for massively parallel analysis of dynamic metabolic regulation across millions of live cells with unprecedented molecular resolution. Establishing metabolism as a mechanism for asymmetrical specification of cell biology reveals completely new cell phenotypes and has broader impacts in cell biology and engineering. Thus, the research studies are foundational for establishing chemical probes for single-cell analysis that can be combined with modern ""omics"" methods to open new opportunities for probing cellular function with high resolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SCD is a lifelong disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Emerging therapies are estimated to be $150k-$200k per patient each year. A companion diagnostic cost in SCD anti-adhesive therapies is estimated at least $3,000 per patient. With improved accessibility to patients living in low- and middle-income countries and scalable curative therapies, the global SCD treatment market size is projected to increase to $8.75B by 2029. Additionally, companion diagnostic-guided drugs have an increased regulatory approval probability of 50% in Phase III clinical trials. The proprietary Endothelium-on-a-chip platform with human donor cells provides a physiologically relevant means to study blood-endothelium interaction. This platform can be integrated into preclinical studies to screen the effect of novel drug candidates as well as for assessment of drug toxicity. In Phase I of the STTR project, standards and quality control criteria for experimental conditions on the Endothelium-on-a-chip were established. The continuing projects with pharmaceutical companies have highlighted the need to scale the manufacturing process.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on optimizing the manufacturing process to enable the scale-up of the assay and develop the machine learning system for automated data analysis. Currently, this assay involves in-house fabrication and is limited to the central laboratory at the company?s location. Manufacturing will be optimized with proper selection of material, fabrication methods, scalable techniques, and systematic integration of different elements of the assay. This will potentially enable the commercialization and implementation of the technology at a larger scale. Current methods of analysis include counting adhesion events manually. This method will be replaced by a machine learning-based system to identify and classify adhesion events and separate those from the endothelial cells in the background. Automated data analysis will enable faster outcomes and remove user bias. Since this approach relies on enhancing the capabilities of the existing platform for scale-up and streamlined analysis, it is anticipated that it will improve its accessibility to the broader research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been the driving force behind several recent high-profile successes of artificial intelligence, enjoying success in areas as diverse as robotic control, wireless communications, and protein structure prediction. While reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for learning, data efficiency is a fundamental challenge: this framework is known to require significant computational resources and vast amount of data. This challenge limits the applicability of reinforcement learning and keeps it from being applied in problems where training data and computational power are limited, including important applications such as wildfire monitoring and the search-and-rescue of lost people using unmanned aerial vehicles. This project addresses this challenge by developing new mathematical foundations of multi-task reinforcement learning and novel learning algorithms that require less data in the aggregate when multiple tasks are jointly learned. The project integrates the research findings with rigorous educational and outreach activities, course development, and student training.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on answering two fundamental questions: (1) Under what conditions does it take less data and computation to learn multiple tasks jointly than it would to learn each task individually? and (2) Can reinforcement learning algorithms learn something meaningful with only a limited amount of data and computation? Our approach to answering these questions draws on techniques from online learning, compressed sensing, and stochastic modeling.  In particular, this project covers both offline settings, where the similarity structure between tasks is learned from a given data set, and online settings, where this learned structure is used to efficiently adapt to a new task ?on the fly?. The project also addresses the fundamental problem of catastrophic forgetting in multi-task learning, where the learned policy loses the ability to perform a previous task after training for a new task. Over the course of this project, the proposed research activities will be evaluated systematically through a series of simulations of multi-robot navigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional customization paradigms often aim at optimizing parameters of pre-defined torque profiles for specific locomotor tasks, which cannot accommodate the continuously varying activities humans perform every day. Prevalent approaches also place emphasis on minimizing slow-converging energy expenditures associated with human locomotion, which is important for able-bodied persons but might not be of high priority for individuals with pathological gaits. The goal of this project is to provide a paradigm shift from task-specific, slow convergent customization to task-invariant, rapid customization. This research will facilitate active learning and adaptation of lower-limb exoskeletons to drastically reduce the cost of gait rehabilitation for nearly a million Americans who sustain a new stroke every year. Key parameters throughout gait rehabilitation such as body-weight support ratio will be automatically customized based on stroke subject's training progress, which will otherwise be tuned by a team of therapists and engineers that usually lasts for hours. This research will also promote the use of exoskeletons for able-bodied users in manufacturing sites, warehouses, battlefields, and other relevant scenes by reducing the associated costs in control parameter customization. The integrated education plan will help cultivate the next-generation wearable robot researchers and motivating K-12 students to further pursue STEM degrees. The human subject studies and exhibits will promote the awareness of wearable technologies among the public, especially among traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) investigate invariant assistive strategies in continuously varying locomotor tasks and environments, 2) construct a complete framework for customizing exoskeleton assistance across locomotor tasks, and 3) understand how the customization framework facilitates assistance adaptations to different user?s volitional motion and activities. Utilizing a two-layer optimization structure will rapidly determine task-invariant assistive strategies in the inner-loop through tracking the desired energetics or centroidal momentum of a virtual reference model, meanwhile updating its parameters in the outer-loop based on human performance-based cost functions. The research the PI and his team will conduct will investigate task-invariant assistive strategies that alter human body energetics and centroidal momentum, construct a complete, human-in-the-loop customization framework that rapidly customizes these two quantities, and validate its efficacy via experiments on human subjects across various locomotor tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effects of wildfire on sediment transport are well studied, and indicate that the absence of vegetation and hydrophobic characteristics of burned soils create conditions that intensify overland flow during subsequent rain events and can mobilize large volumes of fine sediment and initiate debris flows. However, much of this understanding of post-fire hydrologic and geomorphic processes is derived from steep (>30 degrees) and forested landscapes. Post-fire processes in the lower-slope (<1?10 degrees) grassland and shrubland landscapes of the Texas Panhandle are unknown. This project will contribute important data for management of federally classified critical habitat that hosts an endangered fish species, the peppered chub. The project supports undergraduate research at three Hispanic Serving Institutions across Texas.<br/><br/>This study is crucial for understanding the magnitude and timing of post-fire sediment transport in shrublands. A major contribution of this work will be the collection of the first post-fire sediment transport measurements in low-sloping environments like the Texas Panhandle. Measurements of sediment grain size and regolith thickness will inform the degree to which sediment transport rates are limited by stress exerted by overland flow or sediment availability. This project will also constrain the importance of vegetation as an intermittent fire-mediated storage site in low-sloping environments.

It is likely that SMT shortages will continue to be a problem in the foreseeable future due to limited interest in teaching as a career and the lingering impacts of COVID-19. One in five students across the country attends a rural school; therefore, addressing the rural teacher shortage is important to provide educational access for these students. Although the impact of high-quality science and mathematics teaching on student learning is well documented, and retaining high-quality teachers is critical for improving student outcomes, less is known about how to support effective teacher retention in rural schools. Improvements in teachers? working conditions, including strong and supportive school leadership, collaborative colleagues, positive school cultures, parent and community connections, and ambitious instruction, can have a large positive impact on teaching effectiveness, student learning, and teacher retention. Given the dearth of research at scale on rural teacher retention, this project seeks to understand how rural district and school leaders can create positive working conditions and connections with the community, thus leading to greater retention of effective SMTs. <br/><br/>This project at the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago includes partnerships with the Illinois Workforce and Education Research Collaborative and the Illinois Association of Regional Superintendents of Schools. Project goals include the identification of factors associated with SMT retention in rural schools, with a focus on working conditions in rural districts that lead to higher rates of retention of effective SMTs. Drawing on ecological systems theory and a place-conscious education framework, the project will consider both school-based and community-based factors that influence teacher working conditions and thus recruitment and retention trends in rural schools in the state of Illinois. This mixed methods study will address the following research questions: (1) What are the organizational and community characteristics that are associated with rural SMT retention and effectiveness? (2) What school and district policies, strategies, and practices contribute to rural SMT retention and effectiveness? The project team will collect and analyze data from several sources: teacher retention and vacancy rates; school climate and teacher surveys; interviews with school and district leaders, science and math teachers, and community members; and observations of science and math teaching in five ?bright spot? rural districts. Findings from the study will generate insights into the role of school-, district-, and community-level factors in effective rural teacher retention. The project will also seek to contribute insights into how rural district investments toward cultivating effective and committed rural teachers may help support rural students? interest in pursuing careers in STEM and STEM education.

Classical computing has specific limitations in addressing certain cryptographic challenges. The emergence of quantum mechanics provides a unique opportunity to explore alternative approaches that can overcome these limitations and offer enhanced security guarantees, by exploiting the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics. No-cloning means that it is impossible to create an exact copy of quantum information. This offers a promising avenue to tackle problems that are otherwise impossible to solve solely using classical computers. The overarching goal of this project is to develop the foundations of unclonable cryptography. The project is accompanied by a comprehensive education plan to engage undergraduate students in research through new course development, colloquia series, undergraduate crash courses, and accompanied by recruitment efforts that leverage the UCSB Early Scholars program and the California Cal-Bridge program.<br/><br/>There are three main aims associated with the project. The first aim is to propose and study novel notions of encryption schemes and digital signatures equipped with robust guarantees for protecting secret keys. The approach exploits a witness encryption procedure using a quantum state. The second aim is to propose and study new cryptographic notions to protect against the unauthorized distribution of software, by leveraging properties of pseudorandom functions augmented by public verification. The third and final aim is to propose new frameworks, proof techniques, and black-box separations that will lead to a deeper understanding of the area of unclonable cryptography, and having conceptual parallels with indistinguishability obfuscation of classical cryptography. These directions are expected to place unclonable cryptography on more solid theoretical footing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the short melt season, sediments become mobilized and transported into lakes by streams, where the material is deposited on the lake bottom. This is followed by a lengthy winter characterized by lake surface freezing and the slow settling of fine grained material. Consequently, an annual couplet of sediment, referred to as a varve is formed, with coarser material underlying a fine-grained clay cap. These varved records offer valuable information about past climate and environmental changes. However, it is crucial to confirm their timeline using an independent method to ensure confidence in the established time scale. Solar Proton Events (SPEs) are one such potential independent method. SPEs are bursts of high-energy particles released from the Sun during specific solar activities. When these particles reach Earth, they can interact with atmospheric gases, creating isotopes like 10Be, which make their way onto the land surface and eventually into lake sediments. This study proposes to use 10Be anomalies from SPEs as a tool for verifying varve records. By analyzing and comparing 10Be concentrations in laminated sediments collected from various locations across the sub- to high-Arctic, this research aims to determine if 10Be increases associated with SPEs can be used as a reliable method for confirming varved record chronologies. If this method is confirmed, demonstrating that sediment 10Be increases associated with SPEs can verify varve records, it would be a transformative development, allowing precise comparisons between different varved lake sedimentary records and various other records like ice cores, tree rings, and lacustrine (lake-related) records. Ultimately, this could significantly improve our understanding of past climate changes and variability. The research plan includes STEM opportunities for high school students to learn about climate change and to better understand their local environment. This will involve an active learning workshop. The project will also involve students from the University?s Honors College (Commonwealth College) who will participate in lab work and gain research experience.<br/><br/>As a consequence of the short Arctic melt season, when sediment is mobilized and then carried by streams and deposited in lakes, followed by a long period when the surface is frozen and fine-grained material settles to the sediment surface, many Arctic lake sediment records are well-laminated, with an annual couplet of sediment (a varve); a layer of coarse material overlain by a fine-grained clay cap. These laminated layers have the potential to serve as a paleo-clock (a chronology). However, to provide confidence in this clock, it needs to be confirmed by an independent method. This study focuses on such a confirmation. The investigator proposes to identify 10Be anomalies resulting from solar proton events (SPEs) in a set of laminated sediments collected from lakes in different locations, ranging from the sub- to high Arctic, to test whether 10Be increases associated with SPEs can be used to confirm varved record chronology. If successful, this work would represent a transformative development, allowing high-resolution comparisons to be made between different varved lake sedimentary records and between ice cores, tree rings, and lake sediments.

The study of this process is vital to understanding organismal biology and population dynamics. Resource allocation changes under limited food availability. Changes in weather conditions and land use affect food availability for larval insects. Little is known about the constraints and trade-offs that determine changes in allocation of nutrients acquired in the larval stage to various components of reproduction in response to such limited food availability. The proposed work explores this question, using the well-studied Mormon fritillary butterfly. The results will be critical to understanding how pollinator population numbers change in response to both weather variability and directional change in climate means. The work integrates traditional physiology and behavior to yield new insights. It also includes studies in both the laboratory and field, providing a translation between controlled studies with what actually happens in the field. In addition, to the societal importance of understanding pollinator populations, the work will also train undergraduate and graduate students working on the project and disseminate the findings more broadly via collaboration with K-12 teachers. <br/><br/>In insects with complete metamorphosis, nutrients acquired by larvae are allocated during the pupal stage to adult morphological traits that support reproduction and survival, including eggs, storage, and traits used in mate signaling. Allocation is particularly vital in species such as butterflies with incomplete adult diets, where adult feeding cannot readily supplement nitrogenous reserves.  The work traces the effects of allocation of larval nutrient pools of different sizes to investment in offspring, as well as to the generation of mating signals. In so doing, it will reveal the mechanisms underlying mating behavior and fecundity, whose inter-twined fitness effects depend on allocation.  Key questions addressed include: Do quantitative differences in larval food acquisition by females in the lab result in trade-offs among nitrogen-dependent traits including oocyte number (potential reproduction), fat body (storage), and wing pigmentation (mate signaling)? Do these allocation trade-offs differ between lab-reared and field populations? How does investment in wing pigments translate to differences in wing color? How do differences in wing color translate to attractiveness of females to males? Both a common currency (nitrogen) and fitness metrics will be assayed in the allocation work. The results will be integrated in a graphical model. The model will explore variation in trade-offs between the lab and field, and the role of food acquisition and allocation as mechanisms underlying behavior. In addition, to advancing the mechanistic understanding of pollinator populations, the project will also serve as a platform to train undergraduate and graduate students, while also disseminating the research findings via interactions with teachers and docents at the field sites.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology program in the Division of Integrative and Organismal Systems, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to its simplicity and amenability, yeast has become a powerful model system for studying prion biology. Multiple prion elements can co-exist in a single yeast cell, making it crucial to understand how they interact and how their interactions affect yeast cell biology. This project aims to examine how the Swi1 prion interacts with another yeast prion, Mot3, and how such prion-prion interactions affect yeast global transcription and protein-homeostasis. The proposed research program will serve as a platform to train graduate students and summer undergraduate interns. An outreach program will be established to connect Chicago-area underrepresented high school students at the Illinois Math and Science Academy with the Li research laboratory at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. This includes a one-day per week lab activity during the academic year and an eight-week long summer program. The ultimate broader impact is to propel disadvantaged youth in the Chicago area towards further science education and potentially to a science-oriented career.<br/><br/>The protein determinant of the [SWI+] prion is Swi1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and the protein determinant of the [MOT3+] prion is Mot3, a transcription repressor. Both Swi1 and Mot3 are transcriptional modulators affecting yeast multicellularity. A single yeast cell can harbor both [SWI+] and [MOT3+], providing an excellent platform to study prion-prion interactions.  The specific objectives of this project include: 1) Identify prion-specific changes in transcriptome and cell-to-cell heterogeneity using the technology of high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. 2) Examine the genomic occupancies of important transcriptional modulators and epigenetic marks that are functionally linked to [SWI+] and/or [MOT3+] through the CUT&RUN-sequencing methodology. 3) Investigate prion-specific changes in proteomics and post-translational modifications using multiplex-labeling proteomics.

Worldwide, the tremendous growth of large utility-scale solar power plants in desert-like regions has put extreme pressure on local water resources for cleaning dust from solar panels.  A typical solar power plant of 100 megawatts can power 42,000 homes. Over its 25-year life, this power plant requires 38 million gallons of potable water, transported by 4750 tanker trucks, and incurs $22 million in cleaning costs (without even factoring in 25 years of inflation). Cleaning over one-quarter of a million dusty solar panels multiple times a year would still result in a loss of $51 million in energy sales due to this soiling from dust. Reducing these losses and avoiding all these costs has a great impact on lowering the cost of our electricity for homes, electric vehicles, and the growing electrification of society.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to lower the cost of solar electricity, improve the reliability and predictability of solar power plants, and, importantly, eliminate the use of water in the cleaning of dusty solar panels in these desert-like regions. To address technological and scientific challenges related to this new technology, the research?s efforts will include a combination of experiments and modeling to increase the size of prototypes and verify their performance in laboratory and field conditions. The outcomes of these efforts will result in improved efficiency, lower cost, and scalability of this new approach.

During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, several higher education institutions experienced changes in the president and chancellor positions. For Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), in 2022 alone, there were 23 leadership changes announced, and in 2023, 41 changes were announced, almost double within one year. Essentially, one in four HBCUs experienced a resignation or termination at the highest administrative level. These leadership changes have been an added challenge to the ongoing recovery efforts of many HBCUs that were also disproportionately impacted by the global pandemic. HBCUs are critical for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development and for their contributions to STEM research. HBCUs are critical players in helping the nation stay competitive globally and are a national asset, considering the large numbers of diverse students earning degrees in STEM from HBCUs.

One element of SDOH, transportation disadvantage (TD), refers to the absence of reliable transportation at the individual and community level, preventing an estimated 3.6 million people per year from accessing timely medical care, disproportionately impacting people of color, rural communities, disabled people, and low-income populations. The process of integrating and connecting social and health data to decision making, intervention design, and impact evaluation become critical as health systems seek interventions to lessen health inequity attributable to TD. To address these gaps, this SCC-PG project will advance data-informed time and place-responsive TD solutions and other SDOH interventions in the long term by leveraging industry partnerships, novel data collection and computational methods, and stakeholder engagement. By integrating community and individual level data to measure TD, this research will demonstrate innovative resource allocation models, ultimately reducing transportation barriers to healthcare access and improving health equity. <br/><br/>While TD is a recognized barrier to healthcare access, its definition, impacts, and associated interventions are investigated and implemented in a fragmented manner.  Understanding these relationships can support the design of customized interventions to reduce health disparities resulting from TD. Healthcare systems currently rely on coarse data that do not adequately capture spatial and temporal variations of SDOH needs within communities. Interoperability between data sources and how SDOH data will be incorporated into decision-making is also unclear. Through the planning grant, our work will 1) advance knowledge on socioecological theories of TD through extensive stakeholder engagement; 2) develop community sensing methods to address lack of granular TD/SDOH data to enable comprehensive analysis; and 3) demonstrate the integration of multilevel TD/SDOH data into optimization frameworks for decision-making for a mobile clinic pilot project in 6 North Carolina counties.

The 3-day workshop will bring together ~50 petrologists, seismologists, volcanologists, field geophysicists, and geodynamicists, with the goal of catalyzing cross-disciplinary efforts to explore how mantle melting processes impact transcrustal magmatic systems and surface eruptions. A pre-workshop, half-day program for early career researchers aims to enhance training and career development for the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Mantle magma supply is the starting point for building magmatic systems and is a key control on the magma recharge that initiates many volcanic eruptions. Yet, the supply rate of melt and volatiles from the mantle to the crust remains one of the most challenging parameters to constrain in magmatic systems. This workshop aims to galvanize synthesis of recent scientific advances in geophysics, gas geochemistry, geology, and geodynamic modeling that provide new methods to quantify mantle magma supply. Intensive work to understand mantle supply is critical to efforts such as the Subduction Zones in 4D initiative (SZ4D), a large-scale community effort in Earth sciences to probe the processes that underlie subduction zone hazards. Key outcomes of the workshop will include new interdisciplinary scientific collaborations to quantify and model mantle magma supply and forward-looking recommendations for instrument deployment and prioritization in the context of magma imageability. Broader impacts include advancing understanding of magma supply beyond traditional disciplinary perspectives; and pre- and syn-workshop activities focused on early career researcher engagement, training, and career development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These will be identified by keynote talks, moderated panel discussions, poster sessions, and guided discussions amongst all participants. Women?s health is broadly defined as all biological processes that disproportionately impact women across their lifespan. The conference aims to identify how engineering tools can be applied to improve fundamental knowledge of women's health. By bringing together experts and conducting focused discussions, this conference will identify creative new ways that engineering technologies can be used to research women?s health. The findings from the conference will be organized into a peer-reviewed manuscript that will increase the number of scientists and engineers that engage in women?s health engineering research.<br/><br/>Two driving questions for the ElevateHER (Engineering Innovations in Women?s Health Discovery) conference are: (1) How are engineering technologies used to currently drive innovations in women?s health discovery? (2) What opportunities lie within engineering tools to address fundamental knowledge gaps in women?s health? Using these guiding questions, the theme of women?s health, defined broadly as all conditions that disproportionately impact women across their lifespan, will be addressed.  How engineering tools in the following core categories are applied currently to women?s health engineering will be explored and identified: (1) Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering; (2) Biomechanics and Mechanobiology; (3) Devices, Sensors and Photonics; (4) Immuno-engineering.  By convening a diverse group of biomedical engineers and scientists, the conference aims to leverage biomedical technologies' transformative potential to make fundamental discoveries in women's health. Success for the conference will be achieved by identifying and highlighting engineering tools not commonly used in the context of women?s health, thereby catalyzing new collaborative and exploratory pathways within women?s health engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To breach this knowledge gap, this project aims to uncover the adaptive origins of fossil apes by surveying, excavating and analyzing a Middle Miocene understudied site. This project brings together an international, interdisciplinary team that will utilize the latest methods in collecting and analyzing paleontological, paleoecological and geological data. The project increases public engagement in science through outreach activities at schools in the U.S. and near the study site. The project also expands research participation through training and mentoring opportunities in paleoanthropology and geology. <br/><br/>To date, large ape fossils dated to the Middle and Late Miocene are rare and more are needed to adequately infer the type of adaptations that directly preceded the ones found among early Homo species. This project expands our knowledge of the Middle Miocene primate fossil record by conducting a comprehensive paleontological field study on a site that has recently yielded ape-like fossils. The project has four main aims: 1) collecting fossil primate, and other fauna  specimens via thorough surface survey, collection, and excavation; (2) establishing the   phylogenetic position of fossil primate forms found at the site; 3) establishing a precise geochronology for the sequence through lithostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, tephrostratigraphy and radiometric dating of volcanic strata; 4) reconstructing the paleoenvironment and paleoecology of Miocene apes through stable isotope analysis, paleopedology, and paleobotany; and 5) analyzing the adaptations (e.g., diet), community structure, and biogeographic affinities of the associated mammalian fauna. Results from this study inform the adaptive origins of fossil primates and provide critical context for interpreting the environmental and ecological shifts that accompanied the origins of the African apes and humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Taking inspiration from the Fibonacci pattern found in sunflowers, this research will work to establish new design principles for irregular geometric patterns, thus revolutionizing current geometric designs in lattices. Irregular designs of acoustic architected materials offer two groundbreaking achievements, currently unattainable through regular designs: enhanced control of nonlinear wave dynamics and expanded attenuation bandwidth. This research will deepen the current understanding of the physics underlying the relationships between geometric variations and collective wave dynamics in artificially engineered and architected materials and will catalyze the development of the next generation of patterned materials for diverse engineering applications involving acoustic, electromagnetic, and photonic sources or detectors. Reparative learning development activities will target schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged, noise-impacted communities to demonstrate the efficacy of affordable irregular pattern metamaterials in mitigating the recent surge in noise from aircraft jets and airports that adversely affects these communities. Beyond classroom activities, the project aims, through collaboration with community activists, at empowering and enabling these communities to create their own adaptable and economically viable alternatives to current, often toxic, acoustic absorption products. <br/><br/>This NSF project will develop models and experimental prototypes that establish the physical laws behind, and practical applications of, geometric variants in engineering irregular patterned material systems. The models are based on a continuum approximation to forecast the impact of commonly occurring geometric variations found in nature on the dynamics of acoustic waves in resonant lattices. Irregular patterns will be characterized by geometric variants of the resonators? rigidity and proximity. Utilizing this model, attempts will be made to optimize absorption, impedance, and phase properties while expanding the frequency range within irregular lattices, with these properties being functions of the mentioned geometric variants. Building on the insights gained from the models, acoustic attenuation will be executed through prototype designs. Each panel will incorporate Helmholtz resonators featuring both regular and irregular Fibonacci patterns. The primary objective is to mitigate sound in the 200-2000 Hz frequency range, known to be detrimental to human hearing and health, such as noise from highway traffic, aircraft jets, trains, airports, and construction activities. The demonstration prototypes will take the form of indoor and outdoor acoustic attenuation panels designed for integration into buildings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies focus on multimetallic metalloenzymes that carry out life?s reactions and their synthetic analogues. One component focuses on the study of enzymes with Fe4 clusters and analogues with Fe3M, M = Fe or Mo. The focus is on ?organometallic? states of these clusters, which feature an Fe-C bond. Once thought to be rare in life, such states are now proposed as intermediates in terpenoid-biosynthesis enzymes and are found as intermediates central to the function of the world?s largest superfamily of metalloenzymes, the ?radical-SAM (RS)? enzymes, with over 700,000 members identified throughout all forms of life, which carry out a spectacular diversity of essential reactions. A second component will investigate the active site cofactor of isozymes of the enzyme nitrogenase, Fe7M, M = Mo, V, or Fe.  In terms of societal Impact, the response to aims of teaching, training, and learning can be viewed as forming a pyramid. At the apex are intellectual/scientific contributions to the discipline and to the research community. Supporting these are contributions to the training of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates, not only in this group but in those of collaborators. A critical component of this outreach pyramid is an effort to broaden participation in the scientific enterprise, with focus on women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)/electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies of biomimetic synthetic [Fe3,M;S4]3+?alkyl/alkene/alkyne clusters, M = Fe, Mo, are expected to enhance understanding of intermediates of terpenoid-biosynthesis and RS enzymes, with comparison of the [Fe3,M;S4], M = Fe and Mo clusters offering insights into the role of the Mo in modulating the properties of the nitrogenase Fe7Mo catalytic cofactor. Furthermore, as shown by this program, the three nitrogenase isozymes function through a universal mechanism involving ten states, denoted En, n = 0-8. The n = even states of Mo-nitrogenase are EPR active and a majority have been characterized by EPR and ENDOR. In contrast, the n = odd states of the V- and Fe-nitrogenases are EPR-active, and given the mechanistic universality, their study will enable probing the catalytic n = odd states. New constructs of the nitrogenase isozymes will be used to probe whether reactivity differences among the three isozymes derive from influences of the different heterometals or from the differing isozyme active-site environments. In terms of broad scientific impact, better understanding of the nitrogenase enzyme is of great importance.  It is well to remember that the enzyme nitrogenase  carries out biological nitrogen fixation, the conversion of gaseous N2 to two molecules of ammonia, the biologically usable form of nitrogen and that approximately half the world?s human population depends on nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Molecular Biophysics cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These model systems can be extremely versatile, yet straightforward probes for comprehending the complicated mechanistic details that govern oxygen mediated reactivities in biology. Dr. Wijeratne and his team will utilize these powerful tools in shedding light on yet unknown knowledge that can lead to pathways for efficient syntheses of complex molecules, and the discovery of catalysts that can enhance the efficiency of catalysts of oxygen reduction benefiting alternative energy applications.

As well, a broad variety of cryogenic spectroscopic tools will be employed, offering a uniquely specialized skillset to contributing high-school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Outreach and educational aspects of this project will involve the orientation of Birmingham City high school students toward Regional Science Fair via a newly designed Science Club program. Proposed efforts will strive to bridge the gap of scientific literacy of youngsters in the City of Birmingham, which is one of the most income-segregated school districts in the country.   <br/><br/>Heme-containing dioxygenases play pivotal roles in human physiology, disease progression, and aging, consequently attracting substantial research interests within the past decade. However, exact mechanistic details concerning these are only faintly understood. Heme superoxide adducts are presumed to be active oxidants in heme dioxygenases, however, details pertaining to their definitive involvement in the actual enzymatic mechanism remain elusive. Synthetic model systems have long-served as powerful tools in addressing such mechanistic ambiguities, but synthetic heme superoxide adducts are often found to be sluggish oxidants. This anomaly calls for revaluation of explicit modeling of synthetic systems with direct relevance to their biological mode of action. Comprehension of mechanistic details of such model systems can also be of direct benefit for the design of superior synthetic methodologies targeting important complex organic molecules and homogeneous dioxygen reduction catalysts to be used in alternative energy applications. Proposed research will address this gap in knowledge by generating a library of synthetic heme superoxide model systems with divergent structural properties, and thorough investigation into how such structural modulations would influence their reactivity signatures. This work will vertically advance the fundamental understanding of reactivity-governing geometric, electronic, and non-covalent structural properties of mid-valent heme-oxygen intermediates, introducing a new era of heme-oxygen model chemistry.

This knowledge can make the experience of learning science and engineering more meaningful and impactful as learners can see greater connections between the content and how their own experiences and communities. Teachers are able to build learning experiences that bring joy, wonder, and enthusiasm into the science learning environment. However, assessment approaches for documenting and presenting what learners? know have typically not been able to sufficiently represent the new approaches to teaching and learning. This conference brings together researchers, school leaders, and teachers to develop frameworks and resources for making culturally sustaining approaches to teaching and learning science and engineering. <br/><br/>Culturally sustaining approaches to assessment build on learners? repertoires of practice, to embrace what they know and can do as well as who they are, to build on community knowledge and epistemologies, and to engage all the intellectual and linguistic resources they bring to learning environments. The conference workshop would seek to address two challenges in advancing the theory and practice of culturally sustaining approaches to assessments within in and out-of-school settings: (a) conceptualizing the notion of culturally sustaining approaches to assessments by drawing upon a robust body of research in science education, engineering education, classroom assessment, and the learning sciences, and (2) generating a range of images and examples of culturally sustaining approaches to assessments that embody the concept. The workshop will focus on impacting scholarship in culturally sustaining assessment while simultaneously focusing on practical applications. The workshop will bring together researchers, school-based leaders, teachers, and other interested groups in forming approaches that will better support students? learning. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 program.

This systematic problem has long prevailed primarily due to its complex nature. Academic retention, especially in demanding STEM fields like Computer Science, is influenced by many factors, including academic preparedness, socioeconomic backgrounds, mental health, and campus support systems. Additionally, students? diverse experiences and needs make a one-size-fits-all solution ineffective. Institutions need to identify at-risk students early to provide prompt support tailored to students? needs. In addition, as technology and educational methods continue to develop, it is essential to adjust retention strategies to keep up with these changes constantly. Addressing these challenges requires an innovative, data-driven, and student-centric approach. This project will use predictive modeling to identify students at risk of struggling academically. By identifying students? potential adversarial factors early, the project will evaluate prompt and personalized evidence-based interventions to support students in overcoming these challenges. The proposed interventions include small group math tutoring, wellness workshops, and peer and faculty mentorship. This comprehensive approach is expected to improve academic performance and well-being among participating students thereby increasing retention rates. The resulting design, implementation, and measured outcomes can guide future interventions to improve student retention, thus increasing diversity in STEM programs.<br/><br/>This proposed project has three specific aims. Firstly, it aims to assess the impact of evidence-based interventions on students who are at risk of struggling in key areas such as math, mental health, wellness, and self-efficacy. Machine learning algorithms will identify first-year students at risk of probation based on student-reported academic and demographic data. Interventions will be tailored to address identified risk factors, and a control group will be included for comparison purposes. The effectiveness of each intervention will be measured using quantitative surveys, course grades, and qualitative interviews and analyzed using statistical methods such as ANOVA and regression models. Secondly, using a mixed-method approach that combines quantitative and qualitative analyses, this project will refine and improve interventions and predictive models based on participant feedback on the academic program, vocational interests, and concerns about professional development. Finally, the project will evaluate these interventions' sustainability and broader impact, contributing to developing refined methods for future application. All software artifacts and findings will be open-source and available online. The PIs will present their progress and disseminate results on and off campus through presentations, workshops, and publications at relevant conferences. The success of this project is expected to lead to an expanded adoption of these interventions across other academic programs and institutions, thus improving retention and academic success in STEM fields at HSIs. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gene exchange is thought to make species formation difficult because it mixes up genetic backgrounds. This mixing prevents the buildup of differences between species. Nevertheless, genetic data tell us that many species do exchange genes in nature. The goal of this project is to understand how some species can withstand gene exchange. To do so, this project focuses on a pair of pine-feeding insect species that are common pests in the eastern United States. These two species are adapted to different pine species and have exchanged genes throughout their history. By focusing on immature and adult life stages and both sexes, this project will produce a more complete picture of how adaptation to different environments produces new species. By filling gaps in our understanding of how new species arise, this work will deepen our understanding of the world around us. This knowledge will help us preserve biodiversity and combat pests. Additionally, the researchers will use their project to develop educational materials for teaching genetics and evolution to first-year Biology students. This project will also provide opportunities for dozens of students to participate in authentic scientific research. Such experiences can help us retain talented students in STEM disciplines.  <br/><br/>Evolutionary theory predicts that speciation with gene flow is difficult, yet empirical data indicate such divergence scenarios are common in nature. To reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings, the proposed work takes advantage of an experimentally tractable pair of pine sawfly species (Neodiprion lecontei and N. pinetum) that are adapted to different pines and have exceptional genomic resources, extensive complementary data, and a history of divergence with gene flow. First, larval diet manipulations of the focal species and their reciprocal male and female hybrids will be used to quantify reproductive isolation on all combinations of host plants and to evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity in promoting speciation with gene flow. Second, larval transcriptomes of the two species and their reciprocal first-generation hybrids reared on both parental hosts will be used to uncover how divergent transcriptional responses to larval diet contribute to host adaptation and gene misexpression in hybrids. Third, quantitative trait locus mapping in second-generation hybrid males reared on both parental hosts will be used to describe the genetic architecture of host-dependent and host-independent hybrid viability, larval performance, and adult male morphology. Because this work provides intuitive examples of the complexity of phenotypic variation and mechanisms through which natural selection produces new species, data from the proposed work will be used to develop a case study and scientist spotlights for use in introductory Biology courses and to fuel student-driven research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Based on previous literature and The Chicago School of Professional Psychology (TCSPP) institutional research data, it is posited that undergraduates who are online, non-traditional, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students enter their program with low levels of self-efficacy, lacking a sense of belonging in an academic setting. Historically, these students have lower college persistence and completion levels than their on-campus, traditional-aged peers. We seek to study whether a connection to near-peer graduate students with similar demographic traits and lived experiences will break their isolation and increase their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. While the demand for and pursuit of online education, along with subsequent challenges to student persistence and completion, has grown significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dearth of research specifically focused on online students and virtual mentoring. The North Star Project will provide students with directed one-on-one support from their near peers who share intersectional identities with them and have completed similar academic programs. Specifically, the project will engage students enrolled in the Master of Psychology degree as mentors to provide social support to increase Bachelor of Psychology student persistence and completion. Expected outcomes include increased student sense of belonging and self-efficacy in their degree program, resulting in increased rates of persistence, completion, and entry to graduate study.<br/><br/>Through analysis of pre/post-self-efficacy and sense of belonging measurements, mentor and mentee feedback, academic performance, and persistence data, the project will advance knowledge of how mentoring of non-traditional-aged, underrepresented online students affects their persistence, completion, and pursuit of graduate study in psychology. This research will provide new insights into methods of building a sense of belonging and self-efficacy in this growing population of underrepresented, non-traditional-aged students and the differences in the effectiveness of this intervention on campus-based versus fully online students. The research questions to be explored are: does near-peer mentoring enhance an online student?s sense of belonging and self-efficacy in a degree program? Does near-peer mentoring increase online student fall-to-fall persistence? And does a near-peer mentoring program increase degree completion and pursuit of graduate study? Previous work in this area has focused on traditional-aged students in physical sciences on residential campuses. This project has the potential to diversify psychological research, providing a shared, lived experience perspective from underrepresented and non-traditional groups to advance the field. Their increased persistence, completion, and entry into graduate study will increase diverse perspectives in psychological scientific research and other STEM fields. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HIS Program will also generate new knowledge on achieving these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One major source of ?hidden? diversity may be the many mites, nematodes, fungi, and protist symbionts that live inside insects. Such organisms are known to have associations with insects but detecting their presence and quantifying their diversity pose major challenges. This is a potentially massive oversight toward an understanding of global species diversity: if insect-associated symbionts are also often specialized on just one or a few species of insect, this would imply the existence of millions of undescribed and uncounted species, requiring a revision of global species richness estimates. This research will lead to the development of new methods to reveal the eukaryotic symbionts living inside insects. It will also apply those methods to the most ambitious surveys of insect-symbiont diversity to date, spanning two natural insect communities in two different habitats. The research will be integrated into public events in Iowa and Ohio where participants will learn about biodiversity and participate in sampling insects to be used in the research. A major theme will be how much diversity may be hiding even in our own backyards. This project will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students on two campuses, one which is a primarily undergraduate-serving institution. Students will participate in the proposed research but will also receive valuable mentoring in teaching and scientific outreach.<br/>The researchers will develop PCR blocking primers that inhibit amplification of 18S rRNA from the five largest orders of insects (representing >75% of all described insect species) but that permit amplification of 18S rRNA from any other eukaryote in a sample. They will also iteratively design blocking primers for large and/or common symbiont groups detected in natural samples so that smaller/rare symbionts may also be detected. These methods will allow detection of any eukaryotic symbiont associated with insects in the five largest orders (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera). Two first-of-their-kind symbiont diversity surveys will apply the developed methods to >1000 insects collected from each of two natural communities, interrogating all insect hosts for eukaryotic symbionts. Preliminary data show that blockers are effective at greatly reducing host insect DNA amplification and successfully detect mites, nematodes, fungi, and even single-celled apicomplexan protists associated with individual insects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The protocol running on each computer in such a distributed system is called a distributed algorithm. Designing fast and communication-efficient distributed algorithms to solve fundamental distributed problems is an important challenge with a vast range of applications. For many distributed network problems, the performance of the distributed algorithms depends on the concrete amount of initial knowledge of the underlying network given to the individual computers. For instance, it is a realistic assumption that each computer knows an approximation of the network size and, in some cases, the IP addresses of the computers to which it is directly connected. The overarching goal of this project is to study the extent to which the initial knowledge can be leveraged for designing message-efficient algorithms. This research aims to improve our understanding of the performance of distributed algorithms and illuminate the intrinsic trade-offs between running time, communication, and initial knowledge. While the primary focus of the project is theoretical, the presented algorithmic approaches will serve as a foundation for developing practical algorithms with real-world impact.<br/><br/>The project is centered around two main research objectives. The first research objective is to explore the trade-offs between partial-network knowledge and algorithmic performance regarding the construction and verification of fundamental distributed graph structures, assuming that nodes start out with some partial knowledge of their nearby network topology. While there are several known results on the impact of this initial knowledge on the running time of distributed algorithms, the question of how knowledge can be leveraged for designing message-efficient algorithms is still widely unresolved. The distributed graph problems that the project aims to address include approximate breadth-first search tree, single source shortest path tree, vertex coloring, maximal independent set, and maximal matching. The second research objective is to study the minimum amount of knowledge needed for a distributed algorithm to achieve optimal performance. In this context, a novel framework is introduced, where an oracle inspects the node's neighborhood topology up to some radius, and then assigns ""advice"" (a bit string) to each node as that node's initial knowledge. The study of the minimum required length of the advice assigned to a node under this new framework will allow the investigator to quantify the minimum amount of initial knowledge needed, and also to discover the inherent trade-offs between performance and initial knowledge for fundamental graph problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Robotic sensors could also move to seek out sources of fires or gas leaks. A core component of traditional robots is a battery that provides power and energy. Batteries however limit the time and range at which a robot can operate in remote environments. Batteries are also difficult to miniaturize for small microrobots, and battery manufacturing and disposal also have significant environmental impacts due to the use of toxic and scarce critical materials. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research seeks to develop a new class of maintenance-free robotic sensors powered by energy harvested from sources like light using solar cells or from radio transmitters. The key enabling idea is to operate these robots in discrete steps which enables motion with small amounts of harvested energy, but achieving this requires redesigning robot mechanisms, circuits, and control algorithms. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research will establish fundamental techniques for designing battery-free robots ranging from mechanical components and circuits to control software. By redesigning conventional robot sub-systems for compatibility with energy harvesting this research will contribute to the following: 1) strategies to discretize robot motion co-optimized with electronic and structural energy storage and investigate how these methods scale versus robot size; 2) methods to power robots with novel energy harvesting approaches and optimizing power management algorithms for robot motion. 3) perception capabilities for battery-free robots such as onboard vision or odor classification and explore wirelessly connected multi-robot architectures; 4) explore AI based tools and workflows for robot and embedded system design, code generation, power optimization, and debugging; 5) Develop control systems compatible with intermittent motion. This research will also be closely coupled to educational experiences for undergraduates and K-12 students through a programmable robot prototyping platform for algorithm development and education. Undergraduate researchers will help develop the robot platform and outreach activities will be conducted in partnership with nonprofit educational organizations such as A Vision for Electronic Literacy and Access.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The instrumentation upgrade will be installed in a multi-user facility which is focused on data collection and training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers and is incorporated into the classroom activities of some of the nation?s most diverse Earth Science classrooms. This TIMS instrument is used to measure the natural isotopic variations in earth and ocean samples. This analytical tool is incorporated into UCSC classroom instruction but also serves as the primary tool in geologic and climate research projects funded by the National Science Foundation. For example, a major use has been to produce absolute formation ages for rocks and minerals as apart of Earth and Ocean science investigations. This project supports the upgrade the instrumental ion detection system (how isotopic variations are detected) and the computer system that controls the instrument. These upgrades will both improve the quality of data and extend the lifetime of this instrument by replacing the original computer hardware and software. <br/><br/>The upgrade of the IsotopX Phoenix Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) currently installed at UCSC is supported by this award. This instrument was originally installed in a multi-user facility as a part of a 2015 NSF MRI award (1532276) and has since served to produce U, Th, Pb and Sr isotopic data while training UCSC students, postdocs, and faculty researchers. The primary use of the instrument has been to produce U-Pb and U-Th radioisotopic ages for studies that range in time and applications from early solar system studies to Pleistocene climate. In addition to these geochronologic efforts, the instrument is used to produce Sr and Pb isotopic data for UCSC researchers from the Departments of Ocean Sciences, Anthropology and Earth and Planetary Sciences. The project will support the upgrade of the UCSC TIMS with the IsotopX ATONA amplifier technology and the accompanying 10kV high voltage (HV) and computer hardware/software systems. Collectively these modifications will: 1) permit ATONA-Daly collection of large U-series isotopic ratios, improving the precision of geochronologic dates 2) improve transmission of low abundance isotopes from the new HV system; 3) remove the need to exchange amplifier cards between different experiments and 4) ensure a stable computer configuration for this facility for years to come.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shortage of STEM teachers is a national concern. With a growing need for a specialized STEM-focused workforce, high-quality STEM teachers can prepare students for STEM careers, expand access to STEM education, and create a more inclusive and equitable workforce. To help address the shortfall of STEM teachers, the project will encourage qualified mathematics and science undergraduate students and graduates to pursue teaching careers at high schools and middle schools in high-need school districts. The project will support 30 prospective teachers through scholarships, early teaching experiences, mentoring, and teacher preparation. Once they have obtained a teaching credential and start teaching as novice teachers, the project continues to provide professional development opportunities in their first two years of teaching. During this time, STEM and Education professors and experienced teachers will mentor these new teachers and help them refine teaching skills and stay in the teaching profession. <br/><br/>The project at California State University San Marcos includes partnerships with three community colleges (MiraCosta, Palomar, and San Diego Mesa) and two high-need school districts (Escondido Union High School District and San Marcos Unified School District). Project goals are to (1) recruit and retain 30 high-quality STEM majors and professionals to teaching careers over five years; (2) recruit at least 50% underrepresented racial minorities and women in STEM; (3) expand and sustain recruitment and retention mechanisms from freshman to teacher induction; and (4) expand and sustain the STEM education community in the region. The theoretical framework is based on Wenger?s (1998) theory of social participation and identity in a community of practice.  A key feature of the project is to support participants as they develop their identities to include characteristics of both scientists and STEM teachers. The project?s intellectual merit includes a refined model for enhancing cross-disciplinary and cross-college faculty?s ability to recruit and produce high-quality STEM teachers and a deeper understanding of how students find balance between their STEM and teaching identities. The broader impacts of this project will aid the teacher shortage and increase role models for California?s diverse K-12 students. The models for faculty teamwork and collaboration with community colleges and school districts to support STEM teacher recruitment and retention can provide insights for other institutions as results are disseminated. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Concrete is the most widely used construction material and its production releases 8% of human-caused carbon dioxide. Limiting this environmental burden requires improved methods for predicting concrete performance and extending the useful life of new and existing concrete infrastructure. The microstructure of concrete is porous and evolves over time due to seasonal or long-term climate changes. Existing test methodologies and models based on stable environments may not detect this interaction, leading to concrete infrastructure that deteriorates in harsh, cyclical environments. Using a novel accelerated test method, concrete will be exposed to conditions that simulate extreme environments and then the interaction between these environments will be studied. The experimental results will supply data for the development of models to predict concrete performance in cyclical and changing environments. The research will attempt to supply engineers and material scientists with a fundamental understanding of the relationships between the evolving microstructure of concrete and its respective service life in harsh environments. This research will integrate education and curriculum development to increase involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced materials science, data science, and holistic model development.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to quantify changes in microstructural and transport properties imparted by cyclical, dynamic, and coupled environments and to understand the mechanism of interaction resulting from those changes. It has been established that aggressive environments alter concrete microstructure resulting in degraded performance when exposed to another environment, as occurs due to seasonal or climate change. The objectives of this research are to (a) simulate the deterioration caused by cyclical, dynamic, and coupled environments, (b) measure the resulting changes in microstructural and transport properties over the duration of the simulation, and (c) correlate microstructural changes to performance. The following fundamental questions will be addressed: (1) what microstructural characteristics of concrete are altered when exposed to cyclical or dynamic environments? (2) does an interaction occur between the physicochemical changes imparted by one environment and the durability of concrete in another environment? (3) how is the performance of concrete diminished by exposure to cyclical, dynamic, or coupled environments? The long-term aim of this research initiation is to correlate microstructural and transport properties to performance and service life through model development.

Engineering and enhancing this light-matter interaction are critical for advancing new technologies and even the new field of quantum information science and engineering (QISE). One strategy is to couple exciton, an optically excited electron and hole pair, to a nanoscale cavity and form exciton-polariton (EP), which is a half-material and half-light hybrid that inherits the advantages of both worlds. The photon nature allows us to manipulate the EP via optical engineering, and the exciton nature enables strong interaction. The light-matter interaction can be further enhanced in atomically thin semiconductors and engineered by stacking two of these atomic sheets together and precisely controlling their twist angle, forming a semiconducting moiré superlattice. In this proposal, we will design a systematic way to couple the nano-cavities with the semiconducting moiré superlattice to enhance the light-matter interaction to an unprecedented level, in which the device function can be drastically altered even by a single photon. This level of strong light-matter interaction can be utilized to implement photonic quantum simulations, a way to simulate new materials whose properties arise from complicated interactions between electrons. Strategically aligned with the National Quantum Initiative and Semiconductor Technology Initiative, this proposal will develop new course materials to train students for careers in high-demand, cutting-edge semiconductor, optical science, and QISE fields. Hands-on summer workshops on optics and nanofabrication for K-12 students will be organized. The results from this proposal will be disseminated to both the scientific community and the general public to raise national awareness of the importance of QISE and semiconductor technology innovations.<br/><br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop a quantum nonlinear optical device platform to understand and engineer light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials for analog quantum simulations. The project will accomplish a hybrid device that couples the robust excitons in a semiconducting moiré superlattice to nanophotonic resonators, forming a quasiparticle known as moiré exciton-polariton (EP), a half-material and half-light hybrid. The exciton in the semiconducting moiré superlattices formed by atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can be tailored with even stronger interaction thanks to the electronic and excitonic flatbands. Therefore, the moiré superlattice hosts fascinating correlated insulating electronic states, and the exciton resonances are modified due to the moiré potential confinement. Strong coupling of the moiré excitons with the ultra-small mode-volume nanophotonic resonators and resonator arrays will lead to a unique moiré-EP platform for studying correlated excitonic physics and realizing nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions down to the single-photon level, paving the way to transformative quantum nano-optoelectronics such as analog quantum simulations. The proposed research will also transform the current state of power-efficient optical information processing and quantum optoelectronics. This proposal will develop education components well integrated with the proposed research to train students for the future workforce in semiconductor, optical science, and QISE fields. This proposal will develop learning opportunities on optics and nanofabrication for K-12 students. The results from this proposal will be disseminated to a wide scientific audience and shared with the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effects of wildfire on sediment transport are well studied, and indicate that the absence of vegetation and hydrophobic characteristics of burned soils create conditions that intensify overland flow during subsequent rain events and can mobilize large volumes of fine sediment and initiate debris flows. However, much of this understanding of post-fire hydrologic and geomorphic processes is derived from steep (>30 degrees) and forested landscapes. Post-fire processes in the lower-slope (<1?10 degrees) grassland and shrubland landscapes of the Texas Panhandle are unknown.

This project will also constrain the importance of vegetation as an intermittent fire-mediated storage site in low-sloping environments.

Current battery technologies being used in passenger cars do not have the combination of power, life, and operating window needed to fully electrify construction and heavy-duty vehicles. Just like gasoline engines are not used in these workhorse applications, a new kind of battery technology is required to decarbonize these diesel-powered vehicles. The construction and heavy-duty vehicle industries are responsible for >15% of worldwide carbon emissions. Importantly, diesel emissions contain high levels of toxic air contaminants such as sulfur and nitrous oxides that are acute health hazards. Elimination of these emissions will not only improve workforce health, but also improve job safety and lower noise pollution. Further, this technology development will reduce the United States? dependency on fossil fuels and shift energy utilization to renewable sources supporting energy independence and national security.

The main problem with lithium batteries today is they either provide high energy density with very low cycle life or high power with very low energy density. The operating conditions of diesel-powered construction and heavy-duty vehicles require a combination of high power, high energy, and long cycle life that LVO aims to deliver. The research objective for this project is to deliver a scaled LVO-based Li-ion cell based on the technical innovations demonstrated during the Phase I project. The proposed research will scale the LVO anode fabrication starting with larger batch powder preparation then roll-to-roll electrode coating and eventually full >3Ah Li-ion cell assembly. These Li-ion cells will then undergo performance and safety testing to validate meeting the combined power, life, and energy targets needed to decarbonize diesel-powered heavy-duty and construction vehicles.

Nature, unlike geometry class in high school, is not composed of smooth lines, planes, and spheres, but rather bumpy, wrinkled, jagged curves like DNA wrapped up in the cell, surfaces like a mountainous landscape, and volumes like the porous nature of soil in the water table. Fractional derivatives have been used to describe these geometries of nature, but no one has built such geometries from the ground up, element by element. Using textured thin magnetic films, the team will build such geometries as the basis for a new class of materials intermediate between order and disorder. These materials will control transport of information in the form of waves of magnetism, called spin waves, moving through our textured thin film slower (sub-diffusive) or faster (super-diffusive) than possible in simple geometries used up till now. Construction of this new artificial material will be the first experimental realization of a quantum fractional derivative, because spin waves follow the same equations as the wave physics of quantum mechanics, in this case the fractional Schrödinger equation, up till now a purely theoretical idea. A key facet of this work is cross-training of graduate students between theory and experiment, producing a more robust workforce that can work in multiple modalities to solve new problems not tractable otherwise. Fields in which the work force can excel with this knowledge include battery technology, based on porous, fractional materials; the spread of contaminants in soil and the water table; and vascular structures for transport in biological matter, including self-healing materials based on biological ideas.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Fractional derivatives describe the bumpy, wrinkled, and jagged geometries of nature, where an integer derivative leads to divergent results rendering traditional definition of a derivative inapplicable, due to a rapid increase in the tangent and curvature with decreasing ?ruler size?. Such natural geometries in the quantum context have been theoretically described with the fractional Schr?dinger equation but never experimentally studied. The team  will explore the fractional Schr?dinger equation-governed fundamental physics in multi-scale materials that consist of magnetic thin film?based, spatially modulated magnonic crystals. They will design and measure tunable sub-diffusive and super-diffusive transport in this artificial lattice as clear evidence of fractional Schr?dinger equation dynamics. The design builds on a new order-disorder lattice modulation axis, with an ordered lattice at one extreme and a disordered lattice giving rise to Anderson localization at the other. The project will provide a general basis for generating fractional partial differential equations, and lead to a deeper understanding of the present highly empirical approach to porous and other fractional media ranging from battery applications to biomimetic Murray materials to spread of contaminants in soil and the water table. The program will be carried out through tight, integral collaborations between Mingzhong Wu's experimental group at Colorado State University and Lincoln Carr's theoretical group at Colorado School of Mines. Working together as an integrated team encompassing experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics, they propose a multi-faceted approach to meet broader impact goals, centrally themed on blending experiment and theory to train our graduate and undergraduate student to become well-rounded scientists.<br/> <br/>This DMR grant supports research on fundamental understanding of quantum materials and especially exploring principles that cross-cuts many other condensed matter systems with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum materials typically exist in a crystalline environment due to the periodic arrangement of atoms. Hence, the material under question often also has a crystallographic symmetry that includes rotations, reflections, and translations of the space, meaning that the crystal structure remains the same under such operations. In the presence of these symmetries, quantum materials can host new types of physical phenomena. For example, if a quantum material has a rotational symmetry, then it is possible for certain kinds of crystal defects to accumulate quantized electric charges that are fractions of the charge of the electron. The project will incorporate methods from mathematical physics and quantum field theory to further our ability to characterize and classify the robust, quantized properties exhibited by quantum systems with crystalline symmetry. The project will also develop methods to experimentally probe these phenomena in a variety of settings, including two-dimensional quantum materials, photonic systems, and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers.<br/><br/>The project has a strong educational component, as it fully supports a graduate student. The PI will further develop and publicly release lecture notes for his special topics graduate courses on topological quantum matter and on machine learning. In addition, the PI will remain active in various forms of outreach, at the high school level through outreach programs at his institution and through an active social media presence. Ongoing industry collaborations will further broaden the societal impacts of the project through its applications to quantum computing.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research in developing the theory of topological phases of matter with crystalline symmetry. This theory will apply in the regime of strong interactions, and thus go beyond single-particle band theory, using the tools of topological quantum field theory. The project has several different components and builds directly on significant progress from the last project period. In the first component, the PI?s group will extend their theories of two-dimensional strongly interacting crystalline topological phases, which applied to the case orientation-preserving wallpaper groups, to include all 17 wallpaper groups. The second component is to perform numerical calculations for models of fractional Chern insulators and quantum spin liquids, specifically using projected quantum wave functions, to understand the emergence of new crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants and their physical properties. These include invariants obtained through partial symmetry operations and through fractional charges accumulated at lattice defects. The third component is to develop methods to experimentally probe the PI?s recently discovered crystalline topological invariants in two-dimensional quantum materials, photonic systems, and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. Finally, the theoretical advances will be extended to develop a theory of critical phenomena enhanced with crystalline symmetry.<br/><br/>The project has a strong educational component, as it fully supports a graduate student.

Superfluidity is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon in which below a certain temperature, many particles spontaneously join together to act as a wave.  There are just a few physical systems that are known to act this way. The oldest is superfluid liquid helium, which flows with zero viscosity. Superconducting metals are another example, in which electrons act as a wave, and flow with zero resistance, and ultracold atoms in ultrahigh vacuum, stabilized by laser beams and magnetic field are another.  In the past decade, another class of superfluid has received widespread attention, namely ?heavy photons? known as ?polaritons,?  in which photons can flow like a liquid.  This project supports basic research studies of these polariton superfluids, made possible by using semiconductor structures, fabricated as part of this project, that are the best in the world in terms of smoothness and lack of impurities. This project can have broad impact in increasing our understanding of universal properties of superfluids, and in making possible new types of optical communications devices.  The PI of the project will also continue to collaborate with the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh to educate the public on general quantum mechanics and optics topics.<br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>This project supports the continuing work of PI Snoke on fundamental properties of exciton-polaritons in GaAs-AlGaAs microcavities.  The structures are designed by the Snoke group and then fabricated using molecular-beam epitaxy by two labs, the group of Loren Pfeiffer at Princeton and the group of Zbig Wasilewski at the University of Waterloo.  One goal of the project is to advance the quality of these microcavity structures, in particular to make large area structures with a high degree of flatness and very little leakage of light out of the structures, which will allow the possibility of optical circuits on a chip with propagation lengths of hundreds of microns. The Snoke group will use advanced optical methods including picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy, imaging, and interferometry to study polariton superfluids in these structures. In the past year, two breakthrough results have been obtained, and an immediate goal will be to perform followup experiments to fully understand these effects. One of these is the demonstration of a true persistent current of a polariton superfluid in a ring. While indirect evidence for persistent current has been seen in other systems, the microcavity polariton system allows direct, in situ measurement of the phase of the superfluid while it is circulating. The other new result is a highly accurate measurement of the superfluid fraction while the system is in thermal equilibrium.  A universal power law has been observed which was not theoretically predicted nor observed in other experimental systems. Ongoing collaboration with many-body theorists will seek to create an analytical model for this power law. In the longer term, this project will seek to make networks of coupled polariton superfluids, which can be used both for ultrafast (~10 ps) optical switching methods as well as novel methods of analog optical computing to solve mathematical problems that are hard for traditional computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, much of this understanding of post-fire hydrologic and geomorphic processes is derived from steep (>30 degrees) and forested landscapes.

Currently, systematic predictive models for developing new organic materials with targeted physical properties are largely missing, due to the fact that molecules can be packed in enormous number of ways in the three dimensional space. This research aims to develop a new computational scheme that allows more efficient discovery of organic materials based on modern crystallography. To achieve this objective, the PI will first digitize the complex crystallographic data into low-dimensional representations that retain the key information about the molecular packing and crystal symmetry. Second, a computational pipeline will be developed to model the organic materials though different levels of theory. Finally, the power of the new infrastructure will be validated by conducting computational screening of organic materials with superior mechanical and ferroelectric properties that can find potential applications in modern technologies.<br/><br/>This CAREER award also provides support for education and outreach activities that are centered on promoting open-source software development. Specific objectives include (i) training undergraduate and graduate students in computational physics; (ii) holding the summer/winter camps in scientific computing and Python programming for K-12 students; and (iii) organizing workshops for learning about open-source codes in crystallography and materials modeling.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award aims to develop a computational pipeline for digital crystallography that can speed up the discovery of small molecule organic materials for various applications. Nowadays, scientists are seeking to improve the functionalities of organic materials by using chemical and structural manipulations with a design space that can be astronomically large. To develop new organic solids, crystal engineers resort to predictive guidelines. However, systematically discovering new organic crystals from computer simulations remains challenging due to the complex molecular packing as compared to the inorganic counterpart. <br/><br/>In this project, the goal is to develop a new approach to design organic materials by performing a data-intensive investigation of complex crystal packing and its impacts on the physical properties. Specifically, the PI will introduce a digitized description for organic crystal data based on modern mathematical theory and implement them into the open-source code PyXtal. A computational pipeline will be developed to allow high-throughput materials modeling at different levels from molecular mechanics, machine learning to quantum mechanics. Based on this infrastructure, computational screenings of organic materials with superior mechanical strength and ferroelectric properties will be conducted. <br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER project will be centered on promoting open-source software development. Specific objectives include (i) training undergraduate and graduate students in computational physics; (ii) holding the summer/winter camps in scientific computing and Python programming for K-12 students; and (iii) organizing workshops for learning about open-source codes in crystallography and materials modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conducting successful research cruises on these ships requires that scientists (particularly those in supervisory roles on the survey trips ? or ?chief scientists?) understand the logistics of how to request time on ships, how to coordinate personnel and equipment, how to plan for operations and survey tasks at sea, and how to work with vessel crew and staff ? as well as how to deal with unexpected issues which may arise. To maintain a robust scientific workforce that can effectively request, plan, and lead this type of work, early career scientists need to gain training and experience, with consideration for some of the unique challenges faced at both poles such as planning routes through sea ice. There is a particular need for this training and capacity-building at the present time, given increasing arctic research interests and a lag in research cruises (and thus junior scientist training) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To equip and motivate a new generation of seagoing polar oceanographers to use these assets, the project team will host a training cruise on USCGC Healy for approximately twenty early career participants with support from four science mentors and one or more community observers. Participants will participate in virtual pre-cruise meetings, a one-day pre-cruise workshop, and a variety of training modules on the cruise to develop proficiency, build confidence, and become part of an early career polar oceanographer cohort. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The Arctic and Antarctic are hotspots for environmental change and cutting-edge research on oceanographic processes spanning an array of disciplines. Presently the U.S. science community uses a limited suite of vessels for polar oceanographic research, including USCG icebreakers as well as some foreign and private contract research vessels. The barriers to entry for using these platforms are relatively high for junior scientists. Investigators must be familiar with protocols and procedures for requesting these specialized vessels, must have knowledge of how to effectively plan and lead cruises (which sometimes involve multiple and multi-national project teams), and must effectively interface with polar community needs and sensitive ecosystems. As a result, new investigators may be hesitant to propose and lead such cruises, which in turn may limit the amount of novel research being proposed for the U.S. fleet. To equip and motivate a new generation of seagoing polar oceanographers to use these assets, the project team will host a training cruise on USCGC Healy for approximately twenty early career participants with support from four science mentors and one or more community observers. The proposed early career ?Chief Scientist? training program will be conducted on an opportunistic transit of Healy through the Northwest Passage, to train participants about the complexities of planning international research cruises and working with multiple specialists including officers, community observers, crew, and technicians as well as interdisciplinary colleagues. Participants will collect measurements and data along the route to use for educational purposes and/or provide pilot data for new proposals. The program will emphasize training in seagoing logistics, cohort building, a positive and supportive at-sea culture, communication with other leaders and specialists, problem-solving skills, and operational awareness and planning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Persistent nutrient pollution has caused eutrophication and harmful algal blooms globally, estimated to cost more than 4 billion dollars annually in the United States alone. Nutrient pollution threatens ecosystems and food production. Soil erosion will continue to grow with the global urban population. The United States has spent more than a trillion dollars to improve water quality since 1972, equivalent to annual spending of $100 per American, making clean water arguably one of the most expensive environmental investments, more than the cost of clean air. Understanding water quality dynamics is essential yet has remained a major challenge, partly due to its complex nature and data scarcity. This project aims to improve understanding of water quality dynamics by developing forecasting tools and advancing knowledge on how and why water quality changes under different conditions and places. The outcomes will help policymakers, water managers, and the broader public to make informed decisions that ensure the sustainability of water resources.<br/><br/>Despite tremendous progress and efforts in the past decades, water quality measurements have remained arduous and expensive, leading to inconsistent data coverage. Understanding of water quality dynamics therefore is often limited to individual sites. The project aims to determine the patterns of and processes that regulate concentration-discharge relationships of water quality variables across the United States. The project will focus on common water quality variables, including nitrate, total phosphorus, and turbidity (a proxy for total suspended sediment). The project will test whether spatial patterns of concentration-discharge relationships are driven predominantly by land use (relative to other drivers) that regulates hydrological flow paths and source water biogeochemistry. The hypotheses will be tested using Process-Guided Deep Learning integrating traditional Long Short-Term Memory models with reactive transport models. The integration will address the limitations of data scarcity and the ""black box"" nature of deep learning models, and advance predictive accuracy. The project will also 1) make the reconstructed data publicly available; 2) share the trained models for prediction in unmonitored time, space and future scenarios; 3) create videos to educate stakeholders on how to use the models; and 4) increase participation in the field of artificial intelligence/machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On average 400,000 preterm infants are born in the US each year and 49% experience difficulty feeding after discharge. Preterm infants who cannot successfully feed are at increased risk of hospital readmission resulting in significant financial and emotional burdens for their families. In the US the average length of stay for an infant born less than 32 weeks gestation is 13.2 days. The current practice is for babies to remain longer in the NICU at an average cost of $7,000 per day and a national cost of more than $26 billion a year. An estimated 2-day reduction in length of stay with this biomedical device will lower the financial cost of overall neonatal healthcare expenditure by $8.9 billion annually and will reduce the need for future medical interventions because infants are discharged with a stronger early-stage health baseline. Once this product is commonly used in US hospitals, it can be distributed globally to meet demand and benefit infants worldwide.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can save hospitals thousands of dollars while delivering better care and positive patient outcomes. For infants admitted to the NICU, successful oral feeding is a prerequisite for discharge home, but preterm infants often struggle with oral feeding skills largely due to problems coordinating swallowing with breathing. Achieving safe and efficient oral feeding in preterm infants is challenging because of these neurodevelopmental immaturities. Feeding progress is therefore limited by difficulties in maintaining cardiorespiratory stability. This biomedical platform and clinical algorithm interface use big data based on breathing patterns to quantify the synchronization of breathing and swallowing. A precise method of measuring infant breathing patterns during feeding gives clinicians a diagnostic tool to better inform decisions related to feeding advancement.  This device provides objective metrics of feeding success and discharge readiness and may result in decreased readmissions for failure to thrive, substantially reducing healthcare utilizations and post-discharge expenditures. Creating technology that helps infants feed better so they can go home sooner promotes improved parent-infant interactions and optimizes infant development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, cells are able to assess what goes on in their environment and respond accordingly. Inspired by this function, the objective of this CAREER project is to develop unique strategies that enable the introduction of responsive pore-forming structures into polymeric vesicles. Specifically, the work aims to use tube-like macromolecules, known as core-shell bottlebrushes, to emulate the gating function of transmembrane proteins and enable a new class of materials that respond to mechanical activation, optical stimulation, changes in acidity, etc. These cell-like structures will help devise multiresponsive systems that may ultimately be capable of mimicking senses such as touch, sight, and smell. Building upon the results of this research endeavor, one can readily envision to use similar systems for applications such as targeted drug delivery, sensing, as well as active filtration devices for high-value applications. Concomitantly with these scholarly activities, community events will be used to promote STEM education to the general public and, particularly, underrepresented minorities. These activities will include initiatives that transcend the arts and sciences, encourage budding grade-school scientists to become makers, and provide graduate students with the tools to be scientific/technological global thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Technical summary<br/><br/>The underlying goal of this research is to comprehend the crucial phenomena directing the co-assembly of blocky linear and bottlebrush (BB) amphiphilic copolymers towards the fabrication of bioinspired multiresponsive polymersomes. To this end, an integrative and directed strategy that relies on three connected aims was devised: (i) structural evaluation of amphiphilic triblock copolymers (e.g. stiffness, interdigitation, side-chain length), (ii) understanding of the co-assembly of amphiphilic linear and BB block copolymers, and (iii) bestowing of multi-stimuli-responsiveness to polymersomes by incorporating pore-forming BB triblocks in membranes using stimuli such as pH, light, and mechanical force. The numerous parameters that can be controlled in BBs, often orthogonally, such as persistence length, grafting length and density, make them especially alluring for this project. This work aims to bring about hitherto underexplored aspects of the self-assembly of complex polymeric architectures and their co-assembly with conventional linear block copolymers. The broader results of this work may be implemented in the fabrication of intricate, compartmentalized polymersomes that emulate cellular processes, but also in systems such active filtration membranes and/or targeted delivery systems that rely on on-demand cargo release. The PI will also implement several activities to encourage diversity and promote STEM universally and enhance participation of underrepresented minorities. These activities will include maker conferences and hackathons, as well as blending arts and sciences by exploiting the inherent visual appeal of stimuli-responsive materials. Promotions of global views of sciences and inclusion of active learning in curricula are amongst the other integrated objectives of this CAREER project.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current pathological grading/classification system requires extensive information processing by a human brain to interpret highly complex data resources. Histopathology, as the cornerstone of disease diagnosis, has advanced significantly with technological innovations allowing for the capture of images at greater speed and resolution. However, most current histopathological image analysis methods often overlook the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Understanding the intricate interactions among various cell types, which form the cellular components and, in turn, tissue architectures, is crucial for insights into biology and disease status. Analyzing pathological images is crucial, but effectively integrating associated biomedical text data, such as pathological reports, preliminary diagnosis reports, and clinical notes, poses additional challenges. This variety of text data is defined as medical captions, akin to extended image captions, which provide necessary context but also introduce further complexity in diagnostics. Enhanced computational methods that simultaneously leverage pathological slides and their captions could revolutionize the accuracy and efficiency of predicting clinical outcomes.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop novel pathological image-text analysis tools for clinical outcome prediction. The project will focus on 1) developing algorithms for pathological image analysis, which include auto-prompting fine-tuning framework for subtype cell segmentation, cell-level graph learning, patch-level graph learning, and intelligent integration of cell-level graph and patch-level graph for clinical outcome prediction; 2) fine-tuning large language models using biomedical text data to obtain improved text embeddings, which include the development of algorithms for biomedical text data analysis, incorporating fine-tuning of deep pre-trained models for precise biomedical text data representation; 3) Integrating pathological image data with biomedical text data for clinical outcome prediction, which include novel algorithms for the intelligent integration of multi-modal data and cross-modal learning models to generate biomedical text data representation from the histopathological images of the same patient. The successful realization of these aims promises to provide healthcare professionals with powerful tools to enhance the decision-making process, personalize treatment plans, and improve overall patient outcomes. Additionally, the proposed study stands to offer broader insights into the integration of multi-modal medical data, setting a new standard for how medical informatics can be leveraged in the era of big data and precision medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of this project also provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula, as well as inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students and underrepresented students.

Well-publicized over the last few decades is the lack of healthcare solutions for diseases in preemie babies, who are born to mothers with significant socioeconomic inequalities. Case in point, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and often fatal gastrointestinal, or gut, emergency in premature infants that disproportionately affects African American babies. The disease has not only confounded doctors and nurses for 200 years, but also these neonatal emergencies are also frightening to almost all preemie care providers due to its high mortality rate.  Its healthcare in the US requires $3 billion annually due to repeated x-ray testing, surgery, longer hospital stays, and long-term complications of its survivors. An early and accurate diagnostic test for NEC would be a disruptive paradigm shift in preemie intensive care: it would enable medical intervention to be more effective, reduce risk of disease progression, decrease medical care expenses by hundreds of millions annually, and lower mortality.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop requisite reagents for a diagnostic test that will enable detection of infant proteins that play a role in gut health.  Absolute quantitation is a prerequisite for data interpretation and validation between experiments, laboratories, and testing platforms. Research objectives are directed toward critical technical hurdles: (1) determination of optimal reference standard to quantitate host biomolecules in clinical settings and (2) understanding the usage limitations of these reference standards in the background of high variation in the human population. Native and recombinant candidates will be compared and analyzed with various methods.  Anticipated results are reference standards that are age-specific for diagnostic use in the most fragile and smallest patients and that are acceptable to regulatory stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As chicken is a widely consumed source of live-animal protein globally, there is a growing consumer preference for ethically raised animals. The project addresses this demand by fostering improved welfare practices in poultry farming. There are collaborative movements with major producers and institutional consumers to establish evidence-based welfare standards impacting entire supply chain. With a declining agricultural workforce in the United States, it is essential to have automated mechanisms to extend a farmer?s capabilities. This project will develop a smart monitoring system for the birds meeting these needs, resulting in improved bird welfare and amplification of the farmer?s capacity.<br/> <br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project uses audio monitoring and machine listening to measure animal behavior. Since poultry operations differ significantly from farm to farm and over the life of the chicken as it grows from chick to a mature bird, the machine learning algorithms must adapt. The monitoring systems must be appliance-like in that they do not require expertise or any more than minimal involvement on the part of the farmer. This research will result in the advancement and productization of acoustic machine learning algorithms which search out unusual behaviors in the animals in their environment and provide early indications of distress, sickness, discomfort, and feed and water issues to the grower based on intelligent listening and inference. Acoustic approaches do not disturb the animals, are more robust than video for long-term deployment in dusty environments, and operate around the clock and in the dark. By providing early actionable insights to the grower, this technology can correct problems early, thereby improving not only the animal?s welfare, but their productivity as well. By deploying inexpensive microphones at multiple locations in a grow-out house, activities and problems can be localized, bringing precision livestock technology to flock-based animal management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enhancers are sequences in genomes that control when and where genes are expressed and have profound roles during development of multicellular organisms. While they do not code for proteins, the information that enhancers contain is encoded as binding sites for transcription factors (TFs), which are key proteins in gene regulation. It is thought that a key contributor to enhancer function is grammar, or the characteristics of TF binding sites, such as type, number, binding affinities, and arrangement. However, there are still many questions about the principles of enhancer grammar and how those underlie mechanisms for gene regulation. A deeper understanding of enhancers will help us predict phenotypes from genetic information and can be applied in other areas, such as medicine and agriculture. This project will study enhancer grammar in naïve-state pluripotent stem cells, which represent the earliest stages of mammalian development. In addition to advancing knowledge about how gene regulation is encoded into the genome, this work will engage 25-50 undergraduate students per year in mentored, investigative, and original research in preparation for science careers.<br/><br/>To investigate grammatical constraints that underlie naïve-state specific enhancer function, this project will focus on the enhancers for the naïve-state gene Klf4, which contain binding sites for the TFs OCT4, SOX2, ESRRB and STAT3. Preliminary work has indicated that low-affinity TF binding sites are critical for the naïve-state specific function of one Klf4 enhancer. To illuminate the role of this binding affinity constraint in transcription activation mechanisms, this project will utilize molecular approaches to measure the effects of optimizing TF binding sites in this enhancer. Prior studies also have shown that TFs bind to the Klf4 enhancers in a hierarchical order, suggesting that the arrangement of TF binding sites is key to facilitate enhanceosome assembly, particularly interactions among TFs at the Klf4 enhancers. To address these questions, this research will utilize a combination of reporter assays, gene editing, and molecular techniques. Lastly, this project will apply knowledge from these and prior studies of the Klf4 enhancers to other naïve-state specific enhancers. A combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques will be employed to identify and analyze putative naïve-state specific enhancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic computational problem is to infer attributes of the nodes, such as subgroups among them, by only observing the connections between the nodes.  The same problem arises in numerous contexts such as protein-protein interaction networks or gene regulatory networks in biology, disease spread models in epidemiology and fraud detection in financial networks.  More generally, these computational problems are examples of ""Bayesian estimation"" which consists of determining hidden values from observations, that are often noisy and local.  Greater the number of observations, it gets computationally easier to infer the hidden values.  In other words, there is a tradeoff between data/observations collected vs computational resources needed.  This project aims to pin-down the minimum number of observations needed to make the computational problem of inference feasible, for a large class of Bayesian inference problems.  Concretely, a major theme in the project will be to precisely determine the minimum number of observations at which a  powerful algorithmic technique called ""sum-of-squares SDPs"" can efficiently infer the hidden quantities.  Bayesian estimation problems arise naturally in a vast variety of real-life applications, and the project's results will likely shed light on the computational limits for this entire class.<br/><br/>Bayesian estimation is the problem of inferring the values of hidden variables from observed data.  Formally, the problem is specified by a joint distribution over a set of hidden variables  and observations.  The algorithmic problem is to (even approximately) infer the hidden values  given the observations, using the Bayes rule.   The central focus of this project are a class of Bayesian estimation problems analogous to classical constraint satisfaction problems.  Specifically, these are Bayesian estimation problems where the observations are local, in that each of them depend on a small number of hidden values, and are noisy.  For brevity, we refer to these problems as ``Bayesian CSPs"".    They generalize a variety of models like planted CSPs, semi-random models, and stochastic block models.  There is an emerging precise and comprehensive theory of computational complexity of random instances of Bayesian CSPs.  Inspired by ideas from statistical physics, this theory predicts that Bayesian CSPs undergo a computational phase transition wherein they abruptly go from being computationally easy to intractable, as one increases the number of observations  This project will pursue the following research directions.<br/>1. (SoS lower bounds) Sum-of-squares SDPs are one of the most powerful and general algorithmic techniques known.  The project will establish lower bounds for sum-of-squares SDPs as evidence towards computational hardness of random Bayesian CSPs upto the predicted computational phase transition.<br/>2. (Reductions)  Classical complexity theory compares computational difficulty of different problems by reducing problems to each other.    This project aims to develop polynomial-time reductions between different Bayesian CSPs or the same Bayesian CSP in different parameter regimes.  <br/>3. (Beyond random instances) The project will transfer algorithmic insights developed in the context of random Bayesian CSPs, to worst-case settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Web browsers are applications that view web pages; popular ones include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Samsung Internet, and Mozilla Firefox. They use a variety of algorithms to run web applications quickly. One of the most important that applies to a web browser component called its rendering engine, is invalidation. Invalidation means reusing previously-computed results when they could not have changed in the meanwhile. While simple in concept, invalidation is difficult in practice because tracking what can and can not change is extremely difficult. Bugs incorrectly reuse old results or incorrectly recompute unchanged results, and that causes web applications to look wrong, stutter, or freeze. In this project, the investigator presents new programming techniques that automatically track what can and can not change, removing the hardest part of invalidation. If successful, web browsers could adopt these techniques and run web applications faster with fewer bugs. That would ultimately serve the national prosperity by improving software developers' productivity and making more software accessible over the web. The new techniques and tools will be widely disseminated. Research will be integrated into education and training for students, developers and users of web browsers. <br/><br/>Technically, browser invalidation algorithms are a set of cache invalidation algorithms for data with tree-structured dependencies. These algorithms are essential to reducing browser rendering latency. Today, these algorithms are written manually and susceptible to both under- and over-invalidation bugs. The projects explores a new monadic abstraction for tracking tree-structured dependencies between data values and automatically propagating invalidation messages (""dirty bits"") through this dependency graph. A programming interface based on Resource Allocation Is Initialization (RAII) techniques and abstract invalidation allows integrating this abstraction into existing rendering engines. To test whether invalidation bugs are in fact eliminated, the investigator plans to build a black-box invalidation testing tool for web browsers, which will automatically search for invalidation bugs, which should confirm a dramatic reduction in bugs using the invalidation abstraction. To reduce runtime overhead, a compile-time policy framework will allow incrementally annotating protected data so that the dependency-tracking abstraction compiles down to code competitive with today's manual invalidation algorithms. Finally, a tracing system that combines performance counters such as RDTSC with the dependency graph allows attributing computation time to individual HTML elements and Cascading style sheets (CSS) properties and highlighting that performance data in the browser developer tools. In combination, these thrusts aim to make web browsers faster and less buggy while improving web application developers' ability to adapt their applications to web browser invalidation for greater performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced computing resources have increasingly become a critical production factor for the advancement of science and national competitiveness. However, the utilization of such advanced computing resources tends to give advantages to well-resourced institutions and widen the equity gap between these institutions and minority or other under-resourced institutions. This project aims to provide data-enabled pathways to advance equity in the utilization of advanced computing resources. To achieve the goal, the research team implements three interconnected tasks: (a) understanding and defining equity from the stakeholders' perspectives, (b) studying and designing pathways to equity in utilization, and (c) developing and implementing a knowledge portal featuring an interactive data platform to support these pathways to more equitable utilization. These pathways unlock the talents and insights of the researchers in underserved institutions and fields of science for advancing scientific discovery and elevating national competitiveness. <br/><br/>This research studies and provides data-enabled pathways to equity in publicly-supported cyberinfrastructure utilization for scientific discovery. Cyberinfrastructure integrates hardware, software, people, and systems to provide geographically dispersed but operationally integrated advanced computing services to researchers. Equity is a core public value but a concern for utilizing cyberinfrastructure that favors high-capacity research institutions and principal investigators. The NSF?s cyberinfrastructure programs serve as an empirical focal point for understanding equity due to their scale, distributional effects, and impacts on scientific discovery. This project team assembles a database of NSF cyberinfrastructure utilization for 25,798 projects, encompassing 10,277 principal investigators, 1,044 organizations, and 215 science fields from 2003 to 2022.

If these programs have faults, then resulting scientific results can be invalid. For example, a program fault may cause scientists to think something is true when it is not. This can lead to major theoretical or policy shifts. Scientists often learn to write software on the job, but they are rarely taught to write tests. Therefore, scientists do not follow common testing practices in professional software development. This project aims to combat faults in scientific programs by empowering scientists to  efficiently create effective suites of test cases.  The main thrust of the project is to conduct a set of studies to determine the underlying issues for testing in the realm of scientific programming. The new knowledge will be used to create tools that assist scientific programmers to generate suitable test suites for their software. The project integrates the research and education activities by creating  new courses/curriculum directed at non-Computer Science graduate students as well as programming courses for scientific programmers that incorporate the software testing tools into the courses and continue to evaluate research hypotheses. <br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to help scientists write and use tests by automating away many of the challenges they currently face. The project will design and implement tailored test generation tools for scientific programmers. These tools will build on the latest innovations in program synthesis, program analysis, and testing research to support scientists in their construction of test suites.

The applications of circuit complexity span fields as diverse as cryptography, algorithms, discrete mathematics, and software verification. The ultimate goal of this area is to prove that certain functions of interest cannot be computed efficiently. As partial progress towards this goal, a number of results have been proven for restricted models of computation, which has resulted in numerous applications to cryptography and computer science in general. This project aims to prove strong new results on the limits of efficient computation, improving and generalizing the results of the last few decades. Through the integrated research and educational activities, students will learn about a key tool for circuit complexity, matrix rigidity, in a new graduate course. The general interest of students in theoretical computer science will be raised by a new course ""Gems in Theoretical Computer Science"". Outreach beyond the institution will be achieved via a Coursera course sequence. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project seeks to revive progress in three important directions in circuit complexity. First, the project will study explicit constructions of rigid matrices. Such constructions will ideally lead us to a better understanding of the power and limitations of logarithmic-depth circuits, one of the major problems in circuit lower bounds since 1977. Second, this project introduces a new approach to proving lower bounds against constant-depth circuits with counting gates, which is another major problem in circuit complexity. Finally, this project will use the techniques from circuit complexity to construct a weak version of the most fundamental cryptographic primitive, a one-way function (which, despite much effort, is not even known to exist).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will innovate scientific and technological advancements that realize the promise of the Internet of Things, generating not just useful products demanded by the marketplace but products that can save lives and fundamentally improve life cycle infrastructure management. The affordability of our technology directly benefits disadvantaged communities, especially in rural areas where resources are severely limited, and serious infrastructure and substandard building problems tend to linger for years.  In 2015, it was reported on a major national channel that more than 160 roofs collapsed or faced imminent collapse in Massachusetts alone due to snow load throughout 2014-2015.  This SBIR project will inform precisely where unsafe rooftop snow and water loads exist to ensure resources are allocated in advance and as required.<br/><br/>The proposed project efficiently pinpoints risks in flat roof structures at an affordable cost.  All 5.9 million commercial buildings in the USA are vulnerable to the destructive forces of nature and negligence.

Dilapidation caused by a lack of maintenance, which makes up 30.7% of known-cause building failures, often develops slowly and is not apparent immediately. Complete or partial building collapses leave occupants at risk of mortal injury and the valuable property contained in the structure lost or damaged.  Avoiding damage to large-scale infrastructure will save society significant resources and reduce lost productivity. Even minor collapses impact business continuity, affecting revenues and often the larger community, in the case of grocery stores and similar institutions.  The sensor technology improves greatly upon current structural health monitoring methods, limited to single-dimension measurements, higher system costs, and complex installations.

Integrative understanding of biodiversity patterns and change is rarely realized at scale. This project will help coalesce this knowledge; set a research agenda with clear priorities that inform future investments in technology to monitor biodiversity, management decisions, and conservation actions; and help expand and support the scientific community tasked with advancing this work. The workshops will be particularly timely in building capacity to address the widespread need to discover and understand the diversity of life.<br/><br/>The project will convene a series of workshops that will assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and big next steps for observations and data integration for biodiversity research, monitoring, and conservation for organisms and ecosystems.

In addition, and most importantly, the hardware is now too old for operating system updates which not only present a security issue but effectively stunts ongoing research activities. Funds from this grant will be used to purchase three new servers to replace the aging four-server system. The new system includes a main server that will house all user account homes, all software packages, and will handle mass storage for our growing global seismic data set; it will also include a backup server and a small firewall server. The main server will host a software suite recently written by our group that automatically collects (and soon will automatically process) data from nearly two dozen data agencies. This ?big data? project involves storage capacity of over 150 Tb. Servers are tailored to the variety of seismological research project needs, allowing our NSF-funded research activities such as code development, access to GCF's in-house mass storage of global seismic data, and software applications for data processing, as well as web services and backups. Researchers can access the centralized updated GCF system from anywhere, via a  remote connection on their computers.

Mines in Butte, Montana are rich in copper, silver, lead, zinc and manganese.  The Philipsburg mining district is located 60 km northwest of Butte is smaller but shares many geologic features. Preliminary analyses of sphalerite samples from Butte and Philipsburg show that they are both highly enriched in the critical metals gallium, indium, germanium, and tungsten, as well as copper and silver. Recent research has shown that sphalerite that is richest in these metal impurities fluoresces bright red under a hand-held UV lamp.  This phenomenon could provide a low-cost and simple way to sort sphalerite ores with different concentrations of trace metals.  The first goal of this study is to analyze samples from Butte and Philipsburg to map out the distribution of metal impurities in sphalerite at the scale of each mining district (several square miles by up to 1 mile deep).   The second objective is to make sphalerite grains in the laboratory that contain the same trace metals that are found in the natural specimens.  The researchers will then compare the fluorescence behavior of the man-made and natural specimens.  This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in the field of economic geology at Montana Technological University (MTU).  MTU is a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) in an EPSCoR state.  Results from this project may reveal new ways that sphalerite and other ore minerals can be used to study mineral deposits.  This research may also have applications to the use of luminescent sphalerite in materials science and engineering.   <br/> <br/>Butte, Montana is the type example of a zoned, Cordilleran-style, porphyry-lode deposit, as well as being one of the nation?s top historic producers of Cu, Zn, Ag, and Mn.  This study will take advantage of the Anaconda Research Lab (ARL) Collection, a set of over 50,000 hand samples collected from Butte and other mines in Montana that is archived at Montana Tech campus.  Using the ARL Collection, as well as new samples from the active Continental porphyry Cu-Mo mine, the researchers will assemble a suite of > 200 polished ore specimens containing sphalerite and other sulfide minerals from known locations across the entire Butte district, to depths of up to 5000 ft. below the surface.  The sphalerite samples will be analyzed by optical microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLS), Raman spectroscopy, laser ablation ICP-MS, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and hyperspectral cathodoluminescence (HP-CL) to reveal spatial and temporal patterns in trace element distribution, from the micron scale to the km scale.  Machine learning tools will be used to identify correlations between elements in the sphalerite database that will help illuminate the underlying mechanisms by which trace elements enter the ZnS structure.  For example, the researchers hypothesize that the deep red fluorescence mentioned above is linked to coupled substitution of Cu(+1), Ga(+3), and W(+6) for Zn(+2) in the sphalerite lattice.  They will synthesize sphalerite of known trace element compositions using hydrothermal methods and compare the HP-CL, Raman, and PLS signatures of the synthetic and natural specimens.  Finally, they will establish collaboration with a synchrotron laboratory capable of using XANES to verify the oxidation state of tungsten and other trace elements in their metal-doped ZnS and natural sphalerite samples.  This project will support cutting-edge research and graduate-student training in economic geology at Montana Technological University, formerly the Montana School of Mines, a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) in an EPSCoR state.  Results from this project may reveal new ways that sphalerite and other ore minerals can be used to study mineral deposits, and may have applications to the use of luminescent ZnS in materials science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They bring innovative ideas, products, and services to the marketplace. There is a large literature in economics that studies what factors or situations facilitate or prevent entrepreneurship. Since new businesses often require non-negligible starting capital, a key concern is that lack of resources or inability to borrow may prevent some potentially ground-breaking enterprises from emerging. In many countries or industries, venture capital is either missing or tends to overlook projects by women and minorities. From an equity perspective, these may be particularly acute issues for individuals rich in talent but poor in funds. This research investigates whether bequests or gifts from parents to their adult children mitigate formal credit constraints and facilitate business creation. It also studies whether family-financed firms last longer and are more profitable than those created through other means. Answers to these questions can be used to understand to what extent altruism across generations can act as a substitute for poorly functioning credit markets and the importance of the problem of ?missing entrepreneurs.?<br/><br/>This research is made possible by the availability of rich administrative data on intergenerational transfers, socio-demographic information about donors and recipients, and rich measures of business performance, including the date the new business started. The data offer the opportunity not only to test how important parental transfers are for explaining new business creation, but also to test whether family-funded companies are more or less efficient than those created through more traditional channels. In particular, the research investigates whether parental transfers reflect better (soft) information than that available to formal credit markets as opposed to being a pure consumption good; it also investigates whether such transfers, by imposing a more family-led structure on the newly created business, may end up having a negative impact on its performance. The findings from the empirical analysis are used as inputs into a theoretical model that makes explicit the linkages between altruism across generations, credit market imperfections, and occupational choices. The research uses the model as a laboratory for studying the effect of various economic policies, such as changes in estate taxation, expansion and/or restructuring of governmental loan guarantee programs, and government coverage of old-age risks. The latter are an example of the important trade-offs faced by altruistic parents ? often torn between saving for leaving bequests to their children and saving for covering their own long-term health care costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current anti-drone techniques are often prone to failure, not cost effective, or could affect legitimate nearby aircraft. This proposal develops a Multi-UAV Drone Catch Net (MUCH-Net) system that uses a team of low-cost autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles to collaboratively tether a catch net to capture the target drone. This new system puts a high demand on the safe operations of the aerial vehicle team using a learning-based cooperative formation architecture design with environment-aware adaptive safety constraints. The broader impacts of the project include (a) a concept design contest for high-school pre-engineering program students, (b) a robot capture game competition (c) a robotic program for K-12 teachers, (d) promotion of exploratory learning assignments in undergraduate teaching, (e) a new graduate course on safety-critical intelligent multiagent systems, (f) and collaborations with industry partners to facilitate research development, verification, assessment, and technology transfer.<br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to make fundamental contributions to theories of learning-based cooperative control with new environment-aware adaptive safety analysis. Major technical challenges include: (a) due to the complex operating environment, the safety considerations are environment-aware and adaptive; and (b) for multiagent systems, the multiple safety requirements considered can be conflicting with each other or with the initial system state. Existing safety-critical control algorithms for multiagent systems only address constant or time-varying safety sets, which cannot dynamically adapt to the environment, and cannot address safety conflicts. The research investigates learning-based cooperative control architectures to address environment-aware adaptive safety requirements for multiagent systems. An integrated barrier function structure that integrates a cooperative dynamic deep neural network to learn the dynamics of a multi-dimension environment parameter and unknown target velocity is proposed. Safety conflicts are addressed by integrating initial state and virtual barriers into the integrated barrier functions, with indicator functions incorporated to modify the less critical (?soft?) safety sets, in order to guarantee the more critical (?hard?) safety requirements. The proposed architectures are widely applicable to many applications with multiagent systems operating in complex environments.

One reason for the dustiness of the atmosphere is that atmospheric dust concentration has increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, possibly due to the expansion of cleared, tilled, agricultural land.  The prominence of dust as an atmospheric aerosol and its dramatic increase over time motivate research on its climatic effects, among them cooling by reflecting sunlight back to space, warming by trapping outgoing infrared radiation, and indirect effects due to the influence of dust on clouds.  But such research is complicated by the fact that mineral dust enters the atmosphere when strong winds blow over dry soil, thus extreme wind events occurring sporadically and over small areas can make an outsized contribution to the global burden.  The prominence of small-scale extreme events challenges efforts to understand the role of dust in the climate system, especially efforts that rely on long simulations of global climate models which lack the resolution and dynamical sophistication needed to capture small-scale windstorms.<br/><br/>Research under this award considers the role of two types of wind events in global dust emissions: downslope windstorms in mountainous regions and haboobs, strong straight-line wind events caused by the downbursts of collapsing thunderstorms.  Both types of wind events are associated with strong dust emissions and both are driven by small-scale dynamics that are not captured by current global climate models.  The project takes advantage of 40-day simulations of the Model for Predication Across Scales (MPAS), which has the fine-scale resolution (3.75km grid spacing) and more sophisticated dynamics needed for downslope windstorms and haboobs.  The surface winds from the MPAS simulations are taken as inputs to an offline dust emission model to determine the amount of dust emitted by these events.  A second line of research adjusts a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version (CESM), to replicate the dust generated in the offline dust emission experiments.  The CESM simulations are ""nudged"" to conform to observed atmospheric circulation so that the dust aerosol concentration and its climate effects can be compared against real-world measurements.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the potential climatic effects of airborne dust, the large uncertainty as to those effects, and the extent to which human activity could cause large changes in dust concentration.  The dustiness of the atmosphere has other effects, for instance it reduces air quality but it also provides a source of iron and other nutrients for marine ecosystems.  The project also includes a collaboration with the San Diego County Office of Education to develop teaching activities for California high school science teachers.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the current COVID-19 vaccines have saved countless lives and have allowed our society to get back to normal, they have their weaknesses.  The boosters are sometimes not effective, and when they are, they have short-lived efficacy and they can have mild to severe side effects. These weaknesses not only put individuals at risk of getting sick with COVID or the side effects, but those weaknesses also compromise confidence in the vaccine, which affects compliance. The proposed project promises to produce a next-generation vaccine that has better efficacy and significantly reduced side effects, as well as increased duration of effectiveness. This could pave the way for an effective annual administration schedule of the vaccine booster that addresses new strains, much like the seasonal influenza vaccine. <br/><br/>The proposed project intends to produce a next-generation vaccine that can renew confidence in vaccinating to prevent COVID-19. The project's objectives are to show that the vaccine candidate can not only create an immune response that can stop the spread of the virus but also kill the virus. Additionally, it is hoped that the project will show that the vaccine is safer than the current vaccines and that it promotes an immune response that lasts significantly longer than current vaccines. This will be accomplished by testing the vaccine in a Hamster model that simulates the human respiratory system well. Not only will efficacy be tested, but the longevity of the immune response will also be tested. As an additional objective of the study, the route of administration will be examined. The vaccine's effectiveness will be compared by administering it either through injection, nasal administration, or a microneedle patch.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oftentimes, these problems are extremely challenging to solve, requiring significant computational resources and running time. This project aims to use machine learning (ML) to solve these complex problems more efficiently. After all, the problems that, for example, a shipping company must solve to route its trucks will change daily, but not drastically: although demand and traffic will vary, the road network will remain the same. This means that there is likely underlying structure that can be uncovered with the help of ML to optimize algorithm runtime on future problems. This project aims to explore this new frontier of algorithm design where ML can be used to improve the performance of existing discrete optimization algorithms, help practitioners select among different algorithms, and--one day--design entirely new algorithms. In addition to its main technical objectives, this project extends its impact through community engagement and education. This includes expanding the ""Learning Theory Alliance,"" a mentorship program designed to support and develop the ML theory community. The project also includes plans to train graduate students, broaden participation in ML theory research, and integrate the research into new courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>This project investigates how ML can be integrated into algorithm design from a variety of different perspectives, including (1) Algorithm selection:  How can we use ML to choose which algorithm to employ to solve a computational problem? (2) Algorithm configuration: Many practical algorithms, such as integer programming solvers, come with hundreds of tunable parameters that are notoriously difficult to tune by hand. How can we automate algorithm configuration using ML? (3) Algorithm discovery: The long-term goal of this research direction is to identify new algorithms using ML that have never previously been analyzed. Employing ML for discrete optimization is challenging because combinatorial algorithms are highly sensitive, and minor adjustments can result in significant changes in runtime or solution quality. These challenges pose a unique opportunity for the research in this project to provide theoretically-backed guidance for aligning ML approaches to the algorithmic tasks at hand, enabling us to solve extremely complex combinatorial problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finite element methods have undergone decades of study by mathematicians, scientists and engineers in many fields and there is a rich mathematical theory concerning them. They are widely used in scientific computing and modelling to generate accurate simulations of a wide variety of physical processes, most notably the deformation of materials and fluid mechanics. By contrast, deep neural networks are relatively new and have only been widely used in the last decade. In this short time, they have demonstrated remarkable empirical performance on a wide variety of machine learning tasks, most notably in computer vision and natural language processing. Despite this great empirical success, there is still a very limited mathematical understanding of why and how deep neural networks work so well. We hope to leverage the success of deep learning to improve numerical methods for partial differential equations and to leverage the theoretical understanding of the finite element method to better understand deep learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will also provide a good training experience for junior researchers. This project will support 1 graduate student each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Piecewise polynomials represent one of the most important functional classes in approximation theory.  In classical approximation theory and numerical methods for partial differential equations, these functional classes are often represented by linear functional spaces associated with a priori given grids, for example, by splines and finite element spaces. In deep learning, function classes are typically represented by a composition of a sequence of linear functions and coordinate-wise non-linearities. One important non-linearity is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function and its powers (ReLUk).  The resulting functional class, ReLUk-DNN, does not form a linear vector space but is rather parameterized non-linearly by a high-dimensional set of parameters.  This function class can be used to solve partial differential equations and we call the resulting numerical algorithms the finite neuron method (FNM). Proposed research topics include: error estimates for the finite neuron method, universal construction of conforming finite elements for arbitrarily high order partial differential equations, an investigation into how and why the finite neuron method gives a much better asymptotic error estimate than the corresponding finite element method, and the development and analysis of efficient algorithms for using the finite neuron method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most livestock in the western United States are scattered in large pastures and allowed to roam individually and hence do not derive benefits from grazing by large herds of animals. This project aims to develop and test low-cost ear tags that use audio and electrical stimulation to reinforce the natural herd instinct of individual animals when they stray from the herd. High stock density/low duration grazing has the potential of reducing livestock greenhouse emissions and turning rangelands into a net carbon sink. Higher vegetation diversity, more water absorption, reduced erosion, and more wildlife habitat are just some of the other expected ecological benefits of this technology. This technology would also facilitate more efficient and cost-effective ranch management. The risk of livestock theft will be reduced, and the need for fences will decrease since the migratory instincts of livestock work best on larger land areas. Land, livestock, wildlife, ranchers, and the global community would benefit from the development of technology that reinforces the natural herd instinct of grazing animals.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will develop and test a novel approach to stimulating the herd instinct of livestock rather than geographically confining them. Key to implementing this approach is the additional innovation of a unique and low-cost strategy to use ear tags with low-power RF transceivers to calculate herd proximity from an accumulation of individual distance estimates. This technology will use a highly integrated system using an ear tag attached to each animal in the herd. Each tag will use a low-power RF transceiver to periodically send brief signals to the other tags in the herd. The tags will use signal strength measurements to calculate their own approximate distance to every other tag. Each tag will then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity to the rest of the herd. If an animal begins to stray from the herd, the tag will give an audio alert, potentially followed by electrical stimulation to encourage the animal to rejoin its peers. The capability of holding a herd at a density from 10,000 to 1,000,000 pounds per acre will be a key metric of success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Greatly improved outcomes for patients are already possible, keeping patients from returning to the hospital, but only if the patient treatment can be rapidly optimized for the medications prescribed for heart failure. This rapid optimization requires multiple trips back to the doctor for blood tests to guide the treatment plan, adjusting patient medication levels accordingly. Cardiologists have therefore been asking for new technologies to aid their ability to care for heart-failure patients, with an increasing call for remote monitoring technology.<br/> <br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create the first-ever wearable, heart-failure monitor for a peptide molecule released by the heart when the heart is struggling, therefore providing a direct and continuous measurement of how well heart-failure treatment is progressing. Specifically, aptamers, which are oligonucleotides, will be used to capture heart-failure peptide molecules on a tiny electrical wire sensor embedded painlessly a few millimeters beneath the skin surface. As these aptamers capture the peptides, they provide a continuous measurement of the peptide concentrations in the form of an electrical signal. The project will create a working prototype that is like the proven success of wearable continuous glucose monitors, leveraging decades of investment in glucose monitors and significant doctor and patient trust in glucose monitors. Under the Phase II project, the wearable heart-failure monitor prototype will be validated for more than one week of operation in an animal model, a key proof point that will enable further commercial investment in developing the wearable heart-failure monitor for human use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The igneous rocks include granites (New Hampshire is known as the Granite State) and volcanic rocks that form spectacular cliff faces such as the iconic 'Old Man of the Mountain' in Franconia Notch State Park.  The geologic trigger for this phase of magmatism, however, remains largely unknown.  The PI will train undergraduate students at Tufts University to sample the rocks throughout the region in order to obtain chemical and age information that can be used to link the magmatism to a particular geologic process that gave rise to the New Hampshire we see today.  The results will be disseminated in a series of peer-reviewed journal articles, and at professional scientific conferences. As a capstone to the project, the PI and students will develop a dedicated summer-long exhibition at the Museum of the White Mountains in Plymouth, New Hampshire in order to communicate the results to the general public.  The exhibit will include examples of rocks and minerals (both large-scale slabs and microscope slides) that are typical of the region, videos of tectonic plate motions during the opening of the Atlantic, primers on geologic dating techniques, and trail guides for hikers interested in learning more about geology in the White Mountains.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI and undergraduate students at Tufts University will focus on establishing a detailed geochronologic, petrologic, and geochemical dataset for the main phase of magmatism in the White Mountain Magma Series (WMMS), the White Mountain Batholith.  The White Mountain Batholith (WMB) is composed of a series of porphyritic syenites, hornblende granites, biotite granites, and comendite (Na-rich rhyolite) tuffs. Recently published ages from Kinney et al. (2022) reveal that the WMB is not a monolithic pluton, but is instead composed of two distinct magmatic centers: the western batholith and the eastern batholith.  Magmatism first initiated in the western portions of the batholith (198 -190 Ma) and then appears to jump to the eastern portions approximately 10 Myr later (184 - 180 Ma).  The researcher's work will establish the timing of emplacement between various units and plutons, the depths of emplacement, and the petrogenetic relationships between each unit.  Undergraduate student training is a central focus of this work and the PI will train a total of six undergraduate students at Tufts University on scientific research projects over the three year period.  Students will obtain high precision U-Pb zircon ages for key sample localities across the batholith to constrain the timing of emplacement, as well as obtain whole rock major and trace element compositions and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic compositions for each lithological unit in the western, eastern, and central batholiths.  Their results will be an essential first step in distinguishing between various geodynamic scenarios for the origin of the WMMS.  A summer-long dedicated exhibition at the Museum of the White Mountains (Plymouth, NH), and associated public lecture series, will provide a capstone to the project and allow the PI and students to communicate their results to the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This could enable: (1) a significant reduction in false discoveries caused by a lack of reproducible data; (2) a major cost reduction ? ensuring these advancements are accessible to the entire industry; (3) high-frequency sampling, making time-series explorations routine; and (4) the creation of a large-scale database that contains both DNA and RNA data, which could lead to unprecedented discovery and validation of precision medicine biomarkers. Successful completion of this project could have a high likelihood of advancing the health and welfare of the American public, increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States healthcare and life sciences sector, and enhancing partnerships between academia and industry.<br/><br/>The proposed project describes the development of an RNA feature to an existing microbiome measurement and analysis platform that consists of an automated sample collection system and an analytics engine for sequence data. Currently, the question of which genes are being expressed by gut microbes (which can be studied using RNA transcripts) is an extraordinarily promising research field for advancing the understanding of host-microbial interactions. This is because bacteria that make up a small amount of the gut microbiome can still influence the community dramatically through their gene expression. This can be overlooked by DNA sequence data, which only measures bacterial abundance. Despite this, RNA remains under-utilized, as RNA quickly degrades outside of the cell, and most laboratories lack the capability to measure RNA at any significant scale reliably. The main activities of this project will be (1) refining a process for RNA capture and storage, (2) integrating these into the automated hardware system, and (3) developing the methods and infrastructure for analysis of the resulting RNA datasets. This project will allow studies of gene expression in the gut microbiome to become commonplace, allowing researchers to discover more powerful clinically relevant biomarkers for precision medicine applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the next two decades, hundreds of billions of dollars will be invested in the repair and enhancement of wastewater, stormwater, and combined sewer systems to address challenges arising from urbanization and climate change in the United States. This infrastructure is ?leaky? and, therefore, interacts with the surrounding soils and the water cycle. However, the associated hydrologic processes, i.e., subsurface flows of drinking water, stormwater, and groundwater, are often overlooked or insufficiently characterized in urban watershed studies. Do leaky sanitary and storm sewers recharge or discharge water from the watershed? How will a shift from gray to green stormwater infrastructure impact stormwater retention in watersheds with leaky sewers underneath? Addressing the lack of fundamental scientific knowledge on how urban water infrastructure affects surface-subsurface hydrologic processes is imperative to making effective and resilient water infrastructure investments. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effect of urban soil profiles and water distribution and collection infrastructure on urban water balances, improve urban hydrologic models to better quantify the costs and benefits of infrastructure rehabilitation, and ultimately contribute to the goal of developing resilient and reliable urban water systems. The project will provide an efficient modeling tool to the urban drainage and hydrology community, enhance industry-research collaboration in drainage and water resources in the Midwest, and develop an ?Urban Hydrology and Stormwater Management? curriculum that is available to undergraduate and graduate students across the University of Minnesota campuses.<br/><br/>The sustainability and resilience of urban water systems is limited by poor understanding of subsurface hydrologic processes that control flood generation and how they are impacted by urban soil profiles and water distribution and collection infrastructure. These subsurface flows of drinking water, stormwater, wastewater, and groundwater are less characterized in most hydrologic studies and urban hydrologic models. Therefore, there is an urgent need to quantify subsurface hydrologic processes and their interaction with surface infiltration-runoff partitioning in urban watersheds. This project will quantify the effects of urban soil profiles and water distribution and collection infrastructure on event-scale runoff generation and longterm water balances. This will be achieved by integrating soil profile surveys with hydrologic model simulations. First, this work will characterize the soil profiles near water distribution and collection system pipes through soil core sampling and hydraulic profiling. Then, this work will develop a surface-subsurface hydrologic model parameterization that can represent infiltration and exfiltration fluxes between water infrastructure and the unsaturated/saturated zones. Lastly, this work will evaluate the relative effects of soil profiles and sewer pipe conditions and layouts on flood response and long-term water balances through hypothetical simulations at lot and catchment scales. This study focuses on urban watersheds in Milwaukee, WI, while the approach and results are applicable across other urban watersheds in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this age of big data, the significance of uncertainty within the gathered demand data becomes more evident due to factors such as data acquisition device error, measurement inaccuracies, sampling fault, data integration error, etc. This is especially true due to the wide deployment of sensor monitoring infrastructures and increasing prevalence of technologies. This project aims to study a set of facility location optimization problems in face of uncertain demand data, and the goal is to explore new ideas and techniques to develop efficient algorithms to solve these optimization problems on uncertain data. The research will incorporate a variety of methodologies from diverse areas such as discrete math, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, probability theory, operations research, computational geometry, data structures, etc. This project will engage undergraduate and masters students in the development and implementation of algorithms to increase the throughput of them who pursue careers in theoretical computer science research, including continuing on to Ph.D. programs. The research results produced from this project will be integrated into several courses on data structures and algorithms, which will benefit both undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>In this project, three topics will be investigated: The first topic is faulty-tolerant facility locations to provide a safeguard against failures of facilities; the second topic is chromatic facility locations to situate multiple types of facilities; the third topic is proximity connected facility locations to address intelligent facility location problems.

This technology will enable continued breastfeeding and improved infant nutrition. Commercially, the solution will provide the first at-home solution for breast milk preservation, addressing an unmet need for mothers and caregivers. Facilitating continued breastfeeding supports public health by reducing risks of disease and medical costs associated with low breastfeeding rates. Nearly half of new mothers leave full-time careers after childbirth versus less than a quarter of new fathers. While the overall decision for women to leave their careers is multi-faceted, the unequal burden of providing breast milk to feed a child can play a role. Successful development of this technology can open up new research directions in food science, nutrition, and maternal, perinatal, and postnatal health.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of breast milk-preserving formulations composed of safe, food-derived compounds identified through a novel high-throughput screening approach. These formulations inhibit fat breakdown, restore nutritional content, and preserve the structural integrity of frozen breast milk. Human breast milk is the gold standard for infant nutrition, but its complex structure deteriorates during freezer storage, resulting in fat loss, rancidity, and infant rejection of the milk. Infant rejection of breast milk leads many lactating parents to switch to commercial infant formulas even though they are imperfect substitutes for human milk. With a formulation that has been shown to inhibit fat breakdown and preserve other key nutritional indicators for over six months of freezer storage, this technology may be the first affordable, at-home solution to extend breast milk's shelf-life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed system adapts and learns charging preferences in real-time, providing energy management recommendations in the context of coordinated EV charging while considering factors such as electricity demand, pricing, and grid stability. <br/><br/>The methodical modular Markov chain fast and scalable sampler of the proposed incentive-compatible recommender system is designed by integrating: an expansion of Ultimate Pólya-Gamma data augmentation for multi-index choice models to create conjugacy where it does not exist, amortized and non-factorized variational inference for efficiency, Choquet aggregation for complex nonparametric tradeoffs across service features (relaxing linear compensatory behavior), Bayes endogeneity controls, Bayesian optimization for tuning hyperparameters and for integration with a system equilibrium algorithm, and flexible semiparametric representation of heterogeneity in preferences and motives between and within strategic agents. The research team implements the project through an actual residential program for coordinated scheduling of electric-vehicle charging, such as avoiding in-force price endogeneity and constraints via self-selection price discrimination through discrete targeted bundles. In simpler terms, a helpful guide is created for individuals driving electric vehicles, suggesting ideal charging times and needs based on their preferences and driving patterns. Smart technology is employed to gather information, enabling the provision of personalized suggestions to users. The impact of the project extends beyond individual assistance, contributing to the overall sustainability of energy systems and providing valuable tools for energy-related organizations, utilities, and policymakers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The promise of 5G is to enable unprecedented connectivity - smart cars, smart homes, etc. The technology also promises equity of information in the form of broadband coverage across the United States. Thus far, the dream of 5G has been limited due to poor signal range and prohibitive cooling costs. This solution is a thermally-optimized power amplifier that dramatically increases signal range and stays cool - reducing costs. As a result of boosted signal range, broadband coverage will be incentivized in more rural areas, preventing the deepening of the digital divide. Lower costs enable next-generation connectivity between smart devices - such as that between cars which can dramatically lower motor vehicle accidents. Finally, the development and production of this technology, all within the United States, will contribute to the ongoing effort to revitalize the nation?s semiconductor industry.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the scaling and commercialization of an innovative power amplifier technology. State-of-the-art power amplifiers (PAs) are made of gallium nitride. In many cases, the performance of these PAs is thermally limited - they can't handle the heat they generate during operation. The result for wireless communication systems, such as 5G telecom and radar systems, is limited signal range and high cooling costs. By inserting a thin aluminum nitride layer in its semiconductor stack, the power amplifiers developed in this Phase II project will have significantly improved thermal management, resulting in increased efficiency and power handling capabilities. The resulting power amplifiers will reduce cooling cost and increase signal range, enabling next generation telecommunications and advanced radar systems. In this project, production will transition from the university lab to a scaled, commercial process. This transition will involve multiple rounds of power amplifier fabrication and assessment, as well as the formation and maintenance of key partnerships. The result of this project will be a demonstration of the minimum viable product at commercial scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Renewable energy generation has significantly increased over the past decade; however, in order for renewable electricity to be fully utilized along with demand and without curtailment, accompanying energy storage is a necessity. Storage capacity is currently lacking and must catch up with renewable generation to ensure a stable and clean grid. Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion storage solutions remain expensive, hazardous, and subject to global supply chain constraints. The technology involved in this project halves the cost of production compared to lithium-ion, is non-flammable, and utilizes abundant, domestically sourced materials. Advancing the technology in this project will open up new energy storage market opportunities, lower the barrier to adoption for energy storage, eliminate the risk of battery fires, and maximize the usage of renewable energy.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops and demonstrates a new battery in the commercially-relevant amp-hour scale, bringing it from the lab to market. Demonstrating its properties at this scale, namely its energy density, cost, manufacturability, electrochemical properties, and non-flammability, will provide crucial technology and manufacturing validation for the stationary energy storage space. Widespread adoption of this technology will bring about peak power reduction, energy cost reductions, reduced frequency of service interruptions and lower overall greenhouse gas emissions. The Phase I research efforts have successfully demonstrated the feasibility and stability of the chemistry, and the Phase II project will develop an Amp hour (Ah)-level commercially relevant cell product for third party testing and customer validation, as well as for the performance of tests to meet regulatory standards, such as UL 9540A for battery systems.

Any changes in the local economic environment will have ripple effects throughout the network, generating distributional and aggregate consequences. This CAREER award funds research that adopts this network-based view to deepen our understanding of economic growth, capital flow, and industrial policy in an interdependent world. The first project analyzes the network of global capital flows and studies the implication of capital account openness on growth and international convergence. The second project collects new, comprehensive data on input-output tables across countries and analyzes the evolution of production networks as economies grow. The third project studies the incentives and implications of industrial policy when regions engage in economic competition. The fourth project builds a model of global innovation spillovers and analyzes countries' strategic incentives to conduct innovation policy in an interdependent world.<br/><br/>This research develops and applies network models to answer general equilibrium, policy-relevant questions surrounding industrial policy, resource allocation, innovation, and global capital flows. The first project develops a new growth model of the global economy featuring frictional and imperfectly substitutable flows of goods and capital between countries. The model is suitable for studying the dynamic response of countries around the world to changes in trade and investment frictions. The second project develops a production network model with a continuum of sectors. The advantage of working with a continuum is that real-world input-output tables, which come with different levels of aggregations, can be seen as discretization of the continuum, thereby making these tables from different countries or time periods directly comparable. The project applies the model to newly collected, comprehensive panel data on input-output tables and analyzes the evolution of production networks across stages of economic development. The third project studies the strategic incentives for local governments to implement industrial policy in a setting where regions are connected through input-output and trade linkages and thus local industrial policy has general equilibrium impact on other regions. Sufficient statistics that capture the local and cross-region spillover effects of industrial policies show that decentralized interventions can backfire if a local government's policy objectives differ from the central planner's. The project applies the model to study decentralized industrial policy and state interventions in China. The fourth project develops a multi-country, multi-sector endogenous growth model with global knowledge spillovers across countries and sectors. The project analyzes the dynamic and global implication of an economy?s innovation policy targeting both the domestic allocation of R&D resources and the barriers to knowledge diffusion across borders. The model provides a quantitative framework to analyze questions in global innovation policy, technological competition, and protectionism relating to intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Secondly, skyrmion reversible computer fabrication will be carried out to demonstrate and analyze skyrmion stability, voltage-driven skyrmion propagation, skyrmion interactions mediated by the skyrmion-Hall effect, and reversible skyrmion logic gates. Thirdly, skyrmion reservoir computing co-design will be carried out to maximize the reservoir expressivity and energy efficiency, to determine optimal parameters, and to develop a roadmap for the future of skyrmion reservoir computing. And fourthly, skyrmion reservoir computer fabrication will be carried out to measure multi-skyrmion interactions, to control repeatability through pinning sites, and to demonstrate and characterize skyrmion reservoir computers. This project will advance the science of thin film magnetism, improve understanding of the dynamics of magnetic nanostructures, develop new device designs and fabrication methods for skyrmion-based devices, and develop and implement circuits and systems to leverage those dynamics. This project will thus advance knowledge in materials, devices, and computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), a class of novel alloys that mix atoms of different species at nearly equal ratios. The scientific drive for studying CCAs is to understand and utilize the vast chemical and structural design space associated with multiple elements in search of new materials properties. Current understanding about the stability, structures, and properties of alloys is limited to the corners and edges of the multi-element space, such as binary or dilute alloys. The information for CCAs close to the center of the composition space is virtually non-existent for systems with four or more elements. The project intends to fill this knowledge gap in alloy theory for these complex alloy systems by (i) establishing an accurate predictive understanding of the atomic structures in CCAs through a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and statistical mechanics methods, and (ii) integrating quantum mechanical calculations, empirical models and close-loop machine learning methods to predict the structural and defect features in CCAs for accelerated design of CCAs for structural or functional applications.  The multidisciplinary nature of the project brings perspectives from multiple academic fields into the forefront of materials research. The focus of the technologically relevant CCAs will strengthen the U.S. leadership in fundamental alloy research. <br/><br/>The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development. The project brings together national and local partners to create a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise to strengthen Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education and raise the awareness of materials science. In collaboration with Amazon, a cloud-based learning app will be developed to transplant the PI?s research and introduce materials and data science to the general public. The PI will collaborate with SMASH Illinois to offer academic and social programs to underrepresented students to broaden participation in materials education.

Severe lattice distortion is an important phenomenon that is correlated to a variety of physical and chemical properties in CCAs. However, the nature of severe lattice distortions in CCAs is poorly understood, especially with the coupling of SRO. The PI will study SRO and related lattice distortions in CCAs with a unique synergy of mechanism investigation, predictive modeling, and methodology development. The research will elucidate SRO on the structures of lattice distortions in CCAs, which will be utilized to quantify the impact of the distorted lattices on the phonon characteristics of CCAs. Results and methodology from bulk CCAs will be applied to establish a predictive mapping linking defect characteristics with local environments in CCAs, providing the foundation for computational design of CCAs for superior mechanical properties. The project will be driven by the parallel research on a hierarchical data-driven computational framework that enables efficient predictions of structure-property relationships for CCAs. <br/><br/>The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development.

Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), threaten the natural resources of the United States. Separation is the current state-of-practice for PFAS management, but this produces hazardous waste where disposal is costly and introduces long-term liabilities. Plasma is a promising technology, but it struggles to scale. This project investigates in the field an innovative geometric design that enhances plasma ignition and propagation while minimizing energy consumption. Field deployment will positively impact the environment due to water reclamation, waste elimination, and carbon and energy footprint reduction. This project encourages multidisciplinary collaborations and explores novel business models, such as buy-one-donate-one and pay-it-forward. These models couple the success of customers with additional societal benefits. Purafide is also collaborating with LaGuardia Community College?s environmental science program for workforce development. Overall, this project will strengthen the security, stability, and sustainability of water.<br/><br/>The project will pilot a plasma-based treatment technology at a remediation site and a state-maintained landfill, which was identified as high-priority sites by the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team. These are challenging matrices but also where the plasma reactor has successfully eliminated CECs in the past. The innovative geometric approach maximizes the plasma-water interface and enables scaling to commercially relevant flow rates. The success criteria for the pilots will be achieving PFAS levels below the Michigan Maximum allowable PFAS Levels with an effective flow rate of about five gal/min for 1+ (>90%) log reduction. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) will serve as indicator compounds due to their prevalence and the strict standards proposed under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Purafide will design, manufacture, deploy, and parametrically assess the technology in the field. Purafide will also develop in-house analytical capabilities, such as Draft EPA Method 1633, and a technoeconomic model to reduce and predict costs, respectively. Assuming the technical objective is accomplished, the technology readiness level will significantly increase, suggesting the minimum viable product will be ready for the full scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a considerable and growing demand for a biomanufacturing workforce in the United States. Biomanufacturing serves as a source of high-paying jobs and can support strong supply chains. This project's research-based approach will use active learning practices to involve students in a sequence of engaging experiences across three semesters. Students will take a leading role in identifying a biomanufacturing problem, gathering information from existing sources, conducting research activities, analyzing experimental data, and proposing reasonable solutions. By shifting the emphasis from passive learning to active engagement, this approach aims to encourage STEM participation, collaboration, critical thinking, and the practical application of theoretical knowledge to address real-world research challenges. Students will be equipped with the skills necessary to become problem solvers and enduring learners in a variety of fields.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to foster a knowledgeable, engaged, and empowered workforce committed to applying biomanufacturing technologies to solve challenges in food and agricultural fields. The development of environmentally sustainable and cost-effective methods for upgrading biomass will be introduced as a research theme. Students will gain a comprehensive knowledge of biotechnologies through a twelve-week spring seminar series. They will then spend eight weeks during the summer learning how to design experiments, operate equipment, analyze data, report results, and employ theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems. Finally, a six-week symposium will be organized in the fall to showcase research discoveries and gather feedback. The project will host a career workshop designed to assist students in preparing for graduate school or the workforce. By engaging in this program, the students will enhance their ability to enter the STEM workforce and make valuable contributions to society. In addition to promoting a sustainable economy, the project intends  to expand STEM students' involvement in biomanufacturing, thereby cultivating their capacity for critical thinking and collaboration.

The Cyberinfrastructure Leadership Academy (CILA) brings together senior and emerging CI leaders, to provide valuable mentoring and peer-mentoring opportunities, with the goal of preparing emerging CI leaders to take on national and institutional CI leadership roles. This workshop?s objective is to build on the success of previous CILA workshops, focusing specifically on CI leadership for team science, especially grand challenge projects such as NSF?s 10 Big Ideas. This workshop?s goals are (1) to prepare mid-career emerging CI leaders to take on national CI leadership, particularly team science and grand challenge CI leadership, and (2) to mentor CI leaders from traditionally underrepresented populations and institutions. Support for a diverse group of mid-career leaders will bolster career development and networking opportunities aimed at reducing attrition and broadening the pipeline of future CI senior leadership.<br/><br/><br/>The CILA workshop addresses key needs for a critical stage in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) research CI workforce pipeline, the development of senior CI leaders. This workshop is particularly timely given that longstanding national CI leaders are retiring without a clear pool of successors or pathway of succession for under-represented talent. The burgeoning computing and data-intensive research community depends heavily on senior CI leaders, not only to oversee research CI design, development, implementation, and facilitation, but also to shape the research CI ecosystem and agenda, both locally at their own institutions and especially nationally. Crucial to surviving this expertise drain is capturing as much of that expertise as possible before it is irretrievably lost. A valuable mechanism for this is to establish mentoring relationships between senior CI leaders and emerging mid-career CI leaders, because these relationships not only will enable the transfer of knowledge, experience, and wisdom, but also will solidify the ability of the emerging CI leaders to continue to draw on the expertise of the senior CI leaders even after they retire. By co-locating this workshop with a Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC) meeting, participating emerging CI leaders will have an expanded opportunity for peer-mentoring, because CASC serves as the de facto professional society for institutional CI leaders. CASC has committed to accept all CILA workshop participants who are non-CASC members as guests for the associated CASC meeting, at no registration charge. This workshop grant covers the travel expenses of a cohort, for both this workshop and the associated CASC meeting. CASC provides opportunities both to sustain these activities and to broaden their impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The realization that powerful broadcasts and sensitive scientific instruments could not easily coexist led to the creation of protected frequencies for radio astronomy and to the establishment of the National Radio Quiet Zone. These protections have been expanded over time. Nevertheless, the expansion of wireless communications to ever higher frequencies, and the advent of globe-spanning low earth orbit networks of satellites, have resulted in RFI at many more frequencies and in remote locations. The astronomy community needs solutions that enable these communications capabilities while protecting the viability of terrestrial radio telescopes. Building on prior NSF-funded design and planning work, this project will construct an Operational Data Sharing (ODS) system that supports automated, real-time spectrum sharing between radio astronomy observatories and satellite constellations. The project will deploy ODS and experiment with spectrum sharing between the Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the Starlink constellation operated by Space Exploration Technologies, Inc. (SpaceX). Students from diverse backgrounds will take part in this work as summer interns, and public awareness of spectrum issues will be enhanced by integrating real-time updates derived from the ODS system into the existing public-facing telescope status display. <br/> <br/>The planned ODS system transmits information about the radio astronomy observatory?s status and plans to the satellite operator, including the antenna pointing direction or phased array beam direction, receiver center frequency and bandwidth as a function of time. ODS is structured as a database queried by the satellite operator, so only the information needed by that operator is transmitted. The observatory and the operator mutually agree on sharing approaches.  For example, that satellites pointing phased-array beams into a specified zone near the observatory will only transmit in a subset of the operator?s licensed frequencies when the observatory is actively sensing in that band. The project explores methods that enable the operator to use more spectrum than is available under current static protection approaches when the observatory is sensing at other frequencies. The initial deployment and experiments focus on the 10.7-12.7 GHz band.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The threats to the physical security of computer chips and countermeasures have been widely researched. However, adversaries with physical access to the system can still bypass conventional defenses and threaten the systems? security. Examples include tampering with the printed circuit board of a computer chip or removing its package to read out secret keys stored on it. Such attacks, originating at various stages of the microelectronics supply chain, cannot be addressed solely by conventional software security protections due to the lack of awareness about the events occurring at the hardware level.<br/><br/>This project investigates technologies that can secure electronic computing hardware against sophisticated physical attacks originating at various stages of the microelectronics supply chain. Central to this project is a better understanding of the computing machine's physical layer, i.e., its power delivery network (PDN) and its role in achieving secure and trusted hardware. There are three research thrusts to investigate: (1) Fusing the existing statistical metrics used for the analysis of PDN-based signatures, enabling non-invasive, holistic, golden-free, and root cause-aware tamper detection; (2) Using information-theoretic notions to investigate the strength of PDN-based side-channel attacks (i.e., impedance analysis) and developing countermeasures; (3) Creating the PDN-based sensors and fingerprints to monitor the physical integrity system. Successful outcomes of this project will significantly improve the security of computing hardware. Moreover, this project includes various outreach activities, such as organizing special sessions and tutorials, open-sourcing benchmarks, and exposing high school students to basic circuit concepts and simple electrical diagnosis tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This synergy has been significantly transformed by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), a move that, while dramatically enhancing system capabilities, also introduces a layer of complexity, presenting new challenges in ensuring their safety, reliability, and accuracy. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap in the analysis and comprehension of these advanced systems, and many state-of-the-art techniques fall short of verifying their correctness, especially compared to their effectiveness in traditional systems. This project addresses the challenges of testing Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with integrated AI components, using an approach to find counterexamples by means of simulation. It addresses critical scientific needs for analyzing the current adoptions of AI algorithms within smart systems. This research has the potential to develop an open-source falsification tool, accompanied by a dataset package, encouraging more innovations in the field of model-based verification. Upon successful completion of this project, many of the tools can potentially be adapted to various other applications that include AI-driven systems. In this project, PIs also aim to bridge existing gaps by fostering collective initiatives with academic and industrial partners. The project expands the learning experience by creating new project-based courses on software verification for smart systems and AI. It further enriches learning through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students to solve real-world software verification problems and encourages the involvement of more female students in research activities.<br/><br/>Building upon recent research and preliminary results, the project highlights significant gaps in benchmarking and in-depth analysis of AI-enabled CPS. It also addresses the need to improve the detection capabilities of state-of-the-art techniques specifically for these systems. In its first phase, the project investigates current adoptions of AI-enabled CPS and their verification practices through benchmarking and categorization of CPS models, as well as a large-scale empirical assessment of existing falsification methods. The empirical study aims to identify the limitations and challenges of applying existing falsification methods to AI-driven CPS models. The study also explores potential correlations between various model components and the effectiveness of falsification techniques. The insights from this phase will provide CPS practitioners with a deeper understanding of the inherent limitations in existing software verification practices. In its second phase, the project develops and evaluates an innovative approach that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization. This approach is designed to identify high-risk areas in the input domain leading to system property violations and apply effective decision-making within these regions. The optimization process serves to identify the input areas most prone to violate the system properties. The identified high-risk regions are integrated into the decision-making policy of the reinforcement learning algorithm, which attempts to locate the most critical falsifying traces that violate the specified property. The goal of this approach is to reduce the number of executions required for isolating high-risk input regions, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting the most critical violations. This endeavor will improve the safety and reliability of AI-driven systems across various real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building operations account for a large portion of infrastructure energy footprint.  Adaptive building components, such as origami-inspired adaptive facades, are a potential pathway to reduce this cost, by enabling building exteriors to be reconfigured based on light or thermal conditions.  Yet, a major challenge holding these concepts back is their inability to be systematically designed.  Moreover, there is a critical need to provide early and interactive design feedback to better facilitate more useful, nuanced, and ecologically responsive ideas.  This research will create tools that promote creativity, knowledge sharing, and collective workflows that lead to effective technology in all regards, from aesthetics to function.  The work will simultaneously create a new educational track for architecture and engineering students to learn about and test their ideas for adaptive building concepts.  This educational effort is fully integrated into the research by providing a testbed and the critical dataset to inform the computational tools.  Thus, this work will create new design processes for origami-inspired structures and seed the upcoming generations of designers with the skills and penchant to explore adaptive structure concepts.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to establish a new strategy to integrate architectural design processes and human-derived designs with physics-guided machine learning and computational design optimization, and to evaluate this strategy on the application of origami-inspired responsive architecture. The integrated computational-experimental research effort includes three thrusts: 1) establish a coupled human-computer design strategy for component-level origami-inspired adaptive structures to simultaneously meet multiple external environmental interaction goals and intrinsic structural requirements; 2) create a computational framework to evaluate the performance of origami-inspired adaptive structures, and augment their design based on human input and computer guidance; and 3) establish a framework for the introduction of new structural concepts in an architectural design process and application of this framework to identify emergent origami-inspired concepts for adaptive structures.  The project will establish an overarching framework that accelerates and widens innovation through a novel combination of computational tools, which not only connect to the user, but can also augment human creativity.

The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material, is a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The production of cement results in 4-8% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  There is a need to reduce the CO2 emissions both during construction and throughout the life of the concrete.  The Concrete Advancement Network (CAN), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Phase I Center (IUCRC) established by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Oregon State University, focuses on reducing the global warming potential (GWP) of concrete while improving the long-term durability of concrete thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits. CAN focuses on implementing nanotechnology advancements, recyclability, digital manufacturing, multi-scale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced testing techniques will be used to fast-track the implementation of cutting-edge concepts into this key industrial sector, which frequently relies on older technology. Breakthroughs in the concrete field can be achieved using model-based prediction and verification combined with experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  The CAN center aims to develop innovative concrete mixtures with reduced GWP while establishing methods to quantify the GWP and performance for member companies while training a diverse and skilled science and engineering workforce for the industry at large.  Thus, CAN activities are strategically important to the U.S. economy because they will provide long-term solutions for the nation?s deteriorating infrastructure and meet the demand for transportation and buildings.<br/><br/>The CAN University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee site has unique expertise and capabilities related to the use of nanotechnology in concrete, which are translated to the development and effective use of nano-engineered composites, ultra-high-performance concrete, photocatalytic concrete, smart sensor-embedded construction, innovations in by-product utilization, application of supplementary cementitious materials, carbon reduction and sequestration, digital manufacturing, and the extension of service life. In addition, the ISO 17025-certified structural testing facility provides a unique capability to scale-up and verify the concepts developed in the lab. Using advanced analysis and manipulating chemical interactions from nano to mesoscale, CAN researchers aim to develop modern technologies and methods that will result in concrete that is more efficient, more rapidly deployable, and much less dependent upon natural resources. Center research efforts will enable breakthroughs in concrete science by using model-based prediction and verification in lieu of traditional experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  Finally, training programs are planned to help prepare the next generation of engineers while also providing information updates for practitioners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanoparticles are commonly used to modify cell biology, but their influence on cell mechanics and movement in a physiological flow environment is poorly understood. This CAREER award aims to understand how nanoparticles adhered to leukocyte surfaces influence cell deformability and migration from blood microcirculation to inflamed tissues. A combination of biophysical models and microfluidic experiments will be used to generate both fundamental knowledge and design rules for engineering cellular drug carriers. The integrated education plan will disseminate research findings by providing enriching learning experiences at various levels: e.g., a nationwide outreach program for K-12 students, new interdisciplinary teaching examples for undergraduates and graduates, and science communications for the public.<br/><br/>There exists a critical knowledge gap between multiscale mechanical and adhesive properties and particle transport in microscale flows, hindering the development of architected materials. This award aims to test the hypothesis that drug nanoparticles influence leukocyte mechanical and adhesive properties across multiple length scales, thus modulating the delivery of drug payload to the site of inflammation and therapeutic efficacy through three major transport steps: crossflow movement in small blood vessels; rolling and adhesion on the vascular surface under physiological shear; transendothelial migration through small pores. In contrast to in vivo techniques commonly used in biomedical research, this award explicitly models the physical interaction between nanoparticles and cell membranes to examine multiscale deformations; a microfluidic cell culture recapitulates the kinetics of vascular adhesion and transport in vitro. This in silico-in vitro approach will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of leukocyte transport and efficiently explore a multi-dimensional parameter space for nanoparticles (e.g., shape, size, rigidity, concentration, and adhesion strength). Phase diagrams and multiscale structure-property relationships generated over a broad parameter range will serve as a robust and high throughput platform technology to design drug carriers tailored for various species, diseases, and drug administration methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This success is largely attributed to the paradigm of training ML systems by minimizing a single loss function using efficient optimization algorithms. Yet, the landscape is shifting, with many emerging ML applications being better described as games played between multiple intelligent agents or algorithms. These games can be explicit, as seen in markets, traffic routing,  game-solving systems (such as AlphaZero), and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems, or implicit, as in the case of generative adversarial networks, adversarial examples, robust optimization, and so on.  While game theory offers a lens to understand these agent interactions, its classical form struggles to address challenges in contemporary ML applications. This is because traditional game theory often focuses on simpler, low-dimensional games, while ML frequently grapples with complex, high-dimensional ones. This project aims to provide a new theory for these complex, high-dimensional games, and as a result, offer new methods to analyze, train, and design multi-agent ML systems. This project includes an education plan that incorporates course development of both graduate and undergraduate courses, as well as training for graduate students and research opportunities for undergraduates.<br/>   <br/>The first part of the project focuses on concave games, which encompass many that traditional game theory has studied, including all finite games. A game is concave if each agent chooses their strategy from a convex set, and their utility is a concave function in their own strategy. The investigator aims to develop optimal uncoupled algorithms for computing and learning equilibria in high-dimensional games. These games are common in ML applications, and the high-dimensionality often arises from numerous agents or complex available actions. Uncoupled algorithms require minimal knowledge about the game and little player coordination, making them especially suited for high-dimensional games and the preferred type of algorithms in practice. The second part of the project shifts focus to non-concave games, where agents may have non-concave utilities. The investigator plans to thoroughly reassess foundational solution concepts, given that conventional equilibrium existence often hinges on the concavity of utility functions. The main goal of this part is to identify appropriate solution concepts for non-concave games and understand their computational complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome this challenge, this project will design, fabricate, and test modular 3D printing nozzles engineered to structure multi-material composites rapidly before deposition. Achieving faster multi-material printing with higher resolution will open new avenues to product development and manufacturing in several sectors, including health care, electronic device fabrication, and food processing.

As such, a synergistic aim of this award is to empower engineering students to serve as science ambassadors and conduct outreach in the broader community. <br/><br/>The proposed research will elucidate the maximal gains that can be achieved by advective assembly nozzles. Advective assemblers combine add, cut, and rotation junctions in particular sequences to enhance chaotic advection and align, multiply, and shrink co-flowing streamlines.

However, it is unclear how architectures distort when the tortuous geometries are operated at high flow rates. This award will use experimental and computational tools to systematically study architecture fidelity as a function of three classes of independent variables: device geometry, ink rheology, and volumetric throughput. The results will elucidate the fundamental mechanics at work, the architectures that can be realized, the inks that can be processed, and the potential throughputs that can be achieved using advective assembly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While defect-free single crystals are the gold standard for most applications, bundles of imperfect, interacting crystals can be superior in some cases. This grant supports research on how organic semiconductor crystals can be fabricated as networks of twisted braids that counterintuitively outperform single crystals in the transport of electrons and detection and emission of different types of light. These twisted crystals are formed from the melt, making it possible to leverage high throughput fabrication methods. These novel materials support plastic electronics industries based on flexible light emitting diodes and displays, transistors, and wearable electronics for sensing and health monitoring thus augmenting the U.S. economy. At the intersection of solid-state physics, materials science, and process engineering, this multidisciplinary research serves as a rich training platform for undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to workforce development as called for by the CHIPS and Science Act. The colorful patterns created by twisted crystals form the basis of interactive STEAM workshops at the K-12 level. Through this activity, students learn about the concepts of crystals and light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>Designing materials for chiroptoelectronics has relied on the synthesis of chiral molecules enantioselectively or the labor- and atom-intensive resolution of racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Twisted crystals that form spontaneously from the melt can manifest mesoscale chiroptical properties. The challenges facing the advancement of twisted crystals for chiroptoelectronics are the lack of spatial control over the twist sense and direction, and the incompatibility of current batch processing with high throughput manufacturing. This research articulates mechanisms governing twisted crystal formation and how the organization of crystal fibers affects electron and photon transport. This understanding guides the development of scalable processing methods to fabricate twisted crystal films with prescribed orientations and twist sense. Hybrid screw extrusion and roll-to-roll coating of molten material into patterned films are investigated as a scalable manufacturing method for these chiroptoelectronic materials. This continuous processing method involves inline mixing of molecular compounds and twisting additives prior to extrusion; precise control over film thickness, crystallization temperature, and shear profile; and tunable patterning using corrugated rollers. Newly developed rapid differential polarization imaging for inline characterization during film coating permits the screening and optimization of hundreds of electro-optical thin films made of collimated twisted crystal films. Examples of the applications of twisted crystals are circularly polarized light detectors and waveguides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Any failure of security and trust requirements of such circuits can lead to sensitive information leakage, privacy violations, critical infrastructure damage, and potentially endanger of human life. Examining the security of such complex circuits is therefore critical, but at the same time challenging, in that it requires innovative solutions to tackle complexity, a large number of security vulnerabilities, and various methods of attack. <br/><br/>This project develops an innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted security verification framework called SAIF to address the following objectives: (i) provide high verification coverage, (ii) lower security verification time by orders of magnitude by taking humans out of the process, (iii) provide scalability of circuit complexity, and (iv) offer adaptability to new attack surfaces. SAIF provides the design and verification engineers with properties and tools to check for security vulnerabilities before fabrication.

Their empirical success in these diverse fields has sparked interest in further applying such models in new directions, such as numerical analysis and scientific computing. This project is aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the role of neural network models used for numerical analysis and scientific computing, particularly when compared with more classic tools. This is essential in enabling neural network models to be widely deployed in sensitive fields across engineering domains. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project, modern tools from data science and deep learning will be incorporated into graduate curricula, and outreach activities are planned to attract undergraduates as well as underrepresented groups in STEM into this research area.<br/><br/>The focus of this work is on the use of neural network models in numerical algorithms used in models based on the calculus of variations, targeting two case studies. The first is related to functionals that exhibit the Lavrentiev gap phenomena, where an energy gap between the lowest energy achievable by shallow neural networks and more general functions is considered. The second is the Allen-Cahn equation, where the solution strategy of physics-inspired neural networks is analyzed. In the second problem, the adaptivity of neural networks to low-dimensional moving interfaces plays a key role when comparing to e.g. fixed mesh finite element methods. The theoretical results are intended to better understand two fundamental challenges. The first is whether the adaptivity of neural networks can be harnessed for the numerical approximation of spatially very inhomogeneous variational problems. The second seeks to understand the precise situations in which neural network solvers are not expected to outperform traditional solvers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike traditional network management, IBN allows administrators to express their goals in high-level natural language, focusing on 'what' they want the network to achieve rather than 'how' it should be configured. This approach simplifies network management in various environments such as cloud computing data centers, enterprises, and mobile networks. IBN also holds potential for enhancing network security by reducing human errors and responding swiftly to emerging threats. However, there has been little attention given to the unique security challenges posed by IBN for network vendors, administrators, tenants, and users. This project seeks to bridge that gap by addressing IBN's security and trust aspects. The project's novelties are designing a secure and trustworthy IBN architecture, identifying vulnerabilities in current designs, defending against operational attacks, and enhancing resilience against emerging threats. The project's broader significance and importance are in influencing real-world designs, standardization efforts, and industry practices to create a safer and more resilient digital infrastructure for society.<br/><br/>The project aims to embed security considerations into the foundational principles of IBN, design a secure reference architecture, and explore IBN's interactions with other network components. The research team addresses these goals in three central and interdependent research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on securely fulfilling network intents, including designing formal models, identifying security-related race conditions, and addressing side-channel attack vectors. The second thrust ensures the secure fulfillment of network intents through scalable network provenance collection for generating access control policies and maintaining overall decision-making integrity. The third thrust involves integrating secure IBN into the broader network infrastructure, addressing cross-plane vulnerabilities, enforcing correct cross-plane functionality, and enhancing reasoning capabilities through root cause analysis. The research team plans to share project results by enhancing existing open-source IBN implementations and creating new tools for use by other researchers. Additionally, the outcomes are incorporated into networking and security courses for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MGSMs are observed in nature as stiff ligaments attaching seamlessly to bone, or hard shells or beaks on aquatic creatures. Recent advances in machine learning stand to customize the design of MGSMs for engineering purposes, ranging from soft robotics to impact absorption and biomedical devices. However, certifying that ?what we planned is what we built? relies on our ability to peer into these materials and test their properties as they are stretched. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to establish a method which will both cause and quantify three-dimensional deformations inside designed soft materials. Informed testing will reduce the time it takes to determine how mechanical properties vary over a material, speeding up characterization efficiency and feedback loops for generally making personalized soft materials. This research will not only promote the progress of fundamental science but will also advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. By integrating informed testing into the engineering classroom, this research will additionally improve educational outcomes for?and broaden participation of?underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>A single test procedure for reliably identifying spatial heterogeneity for materials undergoing large deformations has not yet been developed. Previously, magnetic resonance cartography had been used as a characterization method for soft materials without internal contrast, but the method  is currently restricted to moderate deformations of homogeneous materials.   This research aims to permit identification of spatial variations of material properties by using continuum mechanics theory and forward finite element simulations to inform experimental boundary conditions for tests. Furthermore, confidence in the identifiability these parameters will be assessed for the first time via an experimental goodness metric. The specific aims of the research are to (1) actuate and measure fully three-dimensional strain fields of MGSMs with peak strain magnitude values newly above 1, (2) assess the usefulness of deformation states using orthogonal strain invariants and the virtual fields method, and (3) determine how kinematic data richness and noise quantifiably alter the identifiability of the complete set of constitutive parameters of interest. The principles of informed testing will additionally be applied to driving assessment strategies in mechanics classrooms using course equity data and will underpin a personalized PrairieLearn-based mechanics mastery platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical analogues of eigenfunctions are standing waves, and the eigenvalues may be thought of as their corresponding frequencies. The interdependence between high-frequency eigenfunctions and the geometry of the manifold on which they live is central to a broad range of fields from quantum physics to number theory. Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-state solutions to the Schrödinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of, say, two squares. This project aims to develop new tools to advance understanding in spectral asymptotics, whose interconnectedness to seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and science make its study particularly valuable. <br/><br/>As part of the research project, the PI intends to develop and use tools from microlocal analysis and the theory of Fourier integral operators to refine a variety of formulas describing the behavior of high-frequency eigenfunctions, and in particular describing what effect the underlying geometry has on these formulas.

Over its five-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 51 unique full-time students, who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in engineering or computer science. First-year students and transfer students will receive four years of scholarship support. The project will leverage available programs in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and incorporate activities, which include cohort building and nurturing throughout the undergraduate education, a three-pronged mentoring program with faculty, peers, and industry partners, a professional practicum through a guaranteed paid internship program, senior preparation course, and a design project. The direct impact of the project will be on the participating scholars and future engineers. In addition, the project has the potential to impact departmental programs and policies. UIC is in a unique position in that implementation and development of a sustainable project will model how these practices may be adopted at other institutions that are research intensive, have a significant portion of transfer students, or are minority serving institutions. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. To achieve this goal, the team will focus on several project objectives. The first is to increase the one-year retention rate. The second objective is to increase the six-year graduation rate. The third is to increase the percentage of graduates with a major-related job offer/graduate study admission within six months of graduation. Multiple research methods will be used to advance the understanding of how high-achieving engineering students from low-income backgrounds develop their engineering identity during their time at UIC, and what are the prevalent aspects of a transfer student?s time at UIC that impact engineering identity development. In addition to providing higher financial support to Pell-eligible students, the institutionalized components of the project will have ripple effects that can impact the success of all UIC engineering students. The project consists of a diverse group of faculty members with synergistic expertise in the various engineering and computer science disciplines, education, and interdisciplinary social sciences. The team plans to evaluate the project using multiple methods including quantitative methods in the form of surveys and qualitative methods in the form of interviews.

Data from these environments holds immense scientific (biodiversity and geological processes), societal (archaeological and cultural remains), environmental (natural resources and mineral deposits), and health-security-economical (asset management and monitoring) significance. However, human operation in crawlspaces is costly, slow, and risky. Existing snake and insect robots can crawl in pipes and operate within centimeter-scale spaces; however, they are too slow or not completely autonomous. There is a pressing need for fast, agile, and efficient autonomous systems specifically designed for crawlspaces. Legged locomotion and multi-rotor flight show promise in addressing this challenge, having already revolutionized numerous remote sensing tasks by surpassing the capabilities of any other robot category. However, their operation remains limited to spacious tunnels. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research that seeks to harness the exceptional agility, efficiency, and speed of legged and rotary-wing robots and adapt it specifically for use in crawlspaces. The project designs a multi-modal robot with extensive locomotion plasticity capable of efficiently traversing extremely tight crawlspaces with agility through bipedal walking and flying. Furthermore, this project aims to promote gender equity in Northeastern University?s robotics program, a significant area of growth identified by school leadership.<br/><br/>Achieving efficient, agile, and fast legged-aerial locomotion in crawlspaces represents a new advancement in robot locomotion. Three knowledge gaps still exist in bridging legged locomotion and multi-rotor flight in crawlspaces: (1) Actuation challenges hinder the scalability of motion control performance, necessary for fast and precise foot placement, when transitioning from legged robots designed for open spaces to smaller robots operating in crawlspaces; (2) Instability issues arising from multi-rotors? air jets near surfaces pose flight immobilization risks; (3) Crawlspaces need several modes of locomotion and there is no systematic robot design framework to accommodate the requirements dictated by these modes. This project will engage in fundamental research to address these gaps, designing a bioinspired locomotion robot capable of walking, hovering, jumping, and running over inclined surfaces to push the operational envelope of mobile robots, making autonomous operations inside extremely tight crawlspaces possible. The project?s efforts revolve around robot and control design. This project?s key areas of innovation include (1) Introducing actuation design paradigms for small robots based on computational structure design for achieving comparable motion control performance seen in large robots; (2) Research and validation of new locomotion feats and underlying models and nonlinear controllers based on the integration of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring to overcome air jet risks in aerial robotics; (3) Co-designing robots and controls through generative design methods to accommodate conflicting requirements imposed by many locomotion modes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The outcomes of the research will lead to technology transfer to industry. The research will be integrated into education and training through new curriculum and outreach to Utah's Youth Education program as well as capture the flag (CTF) competitions.<br/><br/>Technically, this project introduces three key innovations to enable scalable fuzzing for large software. First, it employs object-oriented decomposition to address the extreme complexity of large software, breaking it down into self-contained code units based on the data objects it manipulates. This approach allows for testing individual code units, overcoming the challenges associated with fuzzing entire software systems and enabling deeper code coverage. Second, the project integrates fuzzing-centric optimizations into compilers and operating systems to enhance testing speed. These optimizations minimize fuzzing-irrelevant operations and dynamically adapt to the progress of fuzzing, unlocking hidden speed potential. Third, the project develops history-informed crash analysis to expedite the fuzzing-to-patching cycle by filtering and triaging crashes encountered during testing. Leveraging historical data produced by fuzzing, this analysis comprehensively understands and processes crashes, offering the fidelity and efficiency necessary for addressing large software systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron?s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron?s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Møller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.  The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus.  The work will be done over the period December 2020 ? November 2024. This includes the tracking system, background detectors, auxiliary asymmetry measurement detectors, and certain aspects of beam monitoring/control and beam polarimetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, a comprehensive and scalable evaluation of microarchitecture security beyond manual inspection is imperative. This project investigates systematic and automated leakage reasoning techniques on given microarchitecture designs to identify new vulnerable microarchitectural states and discover novel exploitation mechanisms. The project then explores principled mitigation and prevention techniques to thwart microarchitectural information leakage.  <br/><br/>This project includes the following complementary research efforts: (1) Building models using microarchitecture-level abstraction and constructing model checking-based frameworks that reason timing explicitly for microarchitectural leakage analysis; (2) Developing ways to instantiate microarchitectural vulnerable abstract patterns to ISA-level executions, validate and quantify new leakage attack vectors in both commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and novel microarchitectural mechanisms for future systems; (3) Exploring leakage-free and composable secure microarchitecture schemes with low overhead by employing mitigation techniques according to performance characteristics of the underlying hardware. The proof-of-concept attack/defense artifacts and analysis tools developed from this project could benefit computer architects and system designers in assessing and limiting microarchitectural information leakage. This project also offers extensive opportunities for undergraduate students and under-represented groups to engage in the field of computer architecture and security through a synergy of education and research training efforts.

However, this requires the construction of large-scale energy infrastructure that can be energy- and cost-intensive during manufacturing and decommissioning. In particular, there are critical sustainability challenges in the manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades. These challenges originate from the permanent nature of the fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer composites that underlie the structure of wind turbine blades. This CiviL Infrastructure research for climate change Mitigation and Adaptation (CLIMA) award supports fundamental research that accelerates the discovery of a new family of polymers, Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs), and their composites that are mechanically strong yet reversible to enable recycling, repairing, and reprocessing. Knowledge to be obtained from this project facilitates cost-effective manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades, thereby improving the competitiveness and sustainability of wind energy in the global clean energy landscape and augmenting U.S. industry and economy. Additionally, this project supports outreach activities to engage researchers in national laboratories and the wind energy industry, educate K-12 students in composites, organic materials, computer-aided design and clean energy, recruit undergraduate researchers especially underrepresented groups, and enrich curricula through guest lectures.<br/><br/>Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs) are polymers crosslinked by covalent bonds that become reversible upon heating or other external stimuli. They combine the structural stability of thermosets and the malleability of thermoplastics. This project aims to establish a systematic research framework to discover new CANs and their composites to meet the multi-faceted requirements of material properties posed by the manufacturing, operation, and recycling of wind turbine blades. The research features an interdisciplinary collaboration among mechanics, materials, and manufacturing, and includes three components: molecular design, organic material synthesis, and mechanics of the new polymers. For molecular design, a cyber-platform combining machine learning and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is created to generate candidate monomers of CANs. The synthesis component establishes a feasible molecular design space and allows CAN polymers to be synthesized from candidate monomers for manufacturing and testing. The mechanics component focuses on testing and modeling the mechanical behavior of the CAN polymers. The three components are integrated by preparing coupon-scale CAN composite samples and benchmarking their mechanical properties against the thermoset composites currently used in wind turbine blades. Manufacturing and recycling processes such as vacuum bag molding, thermoforming, lamination and chemical dissolution of CAN composites and the effects of processing conditions are also investigated. <br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) and the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) programs of the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The formation of large-area separation membranes is especially significant for a range of gas separations, such as for CO2 removal from air or flue gas. Small-scale (1 cm2) MOF-based membranes have shown utility for a range of high-value separation applications. However, a lack of fundamental knowledge exists to create easily scalable, advanced manufacturing of large areas of MOF membranes that still preserve the lab-scale performance. This award supports a combination of x-ray probes, modeling, and experimental techniques to fully understand how MOF thin films form. This fundamental knowledge is used to develop a continuous, roll-to-roll coating technique that can create large-area MOF thin films with outstanding separation performance. Students are engaged to contribute to the development of new MOF crystallization theories and modeling tools that can be used in research as well as industrial environments.

Rapid timescale, in-situ x-ray scattering measurements coupled with microkinetic modeling are used to understand thin film MOF nucleation and growth mechanisms under evaporative/pervaporation conditions. The microkinetic model simulates billions of oligomerization reactions to predict nucleation rate, growth rate, and size distribution. The microkinetic model helps in selecting a range of operating conditions for high throughput (HT) PAC experiments for the optimization of MOF thin film structure and maximizing performance. By connecting it to a gas chromatograph, the HT setup is also used to obtain gas separation factors for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures. The ensuing process-structure-property relationships guide the scaling of the PAC method to grow 50 cm2  MOF films, followed by a model-based design of a roll-to-roll coating system for large-scale manufacturing of MOF films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pseudomonas putida is a versatile Gram-negative organism that is native to soil, and is being developed as a chassis for numerous industrial and environmental applications. Yet, no comprehensive study of epigenetic regulation, nor any investigation of epigenetic effects on synthetic gene circuit function, has yet been reported in P. putida. This CAREER program will examine how genome methylation affects gene expression changes that are essential for the transition of P. putida from laboratory to soil conditions. These epigenetic changes may similarly affect the function of integrated synthetic gene circuits. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of genome methylation on gene expression and synthetic gene circuit function in P. putida within its native soil environment. To achieve the overall objective, two specific objectives will be pursued: 1) Determine the effect of genome methylation on endogenous gene expression of P. putida in soil. 2) Control synthetic gene circuit expression in P. putida by modulation of DNA methylation. The proposed research will be complemented by educational activities that create new open-access higher education resources for teaching the core principles of synthetic biology.

The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material, is a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The production of cement results in 4-8% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  There is a need to reduce the CO2 emissions both during construction and throughout the life of the concrete.  The Concrete Advancement Network (CAN), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Phase I Center (IUCRC) established by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Oregon State University, focuses on reducing the global warming potential (GWP) of concrete while improving the long-term durability of concrete thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits. CAN focuses on implementing nanotechnology advancements, recyclability, digital manufacturing, multi-scale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced testing techniques will be used to fast-track the implementation of cutting-edge concepts into this key industrial sector, which frequently relies on older technology. Breakthroughs in the concrete field can be achieved using model-based prediction and verification combined with experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  The CAN center aims to develop innovative concrete mixtures with reduced GWP while establishing methods to quantify the GWP and performance for member companies while training a diverse and skilled science and engineering workforce for the industry at large.  Thus, CAN activities are strategically important to the U.S. economy because they will provide long-term solutions for the nation?s deteriorating infrastructure and meet the demand for transportation and buildings.<br/><br/>The CAN Oregon State site is focused on the development of approaches to improve concrete performance predictions specifically as it relates to durability, by-product utilization, and a reduced carbon footprint.

It is anticipated that work will focus on the development of mixture proportioning tools that result in mixtures with low GWP as well as approaches that better consider the service life emissions of concrete.  Advanced experimental techniques like neutron radiography are planned to assess the influence of fluid transport and carbonation on concrete development and performance.

As the intensities of these events continue to increase worldwide due to climate change, the need for their early monitoring and tracking has also increased. A UAS, consisting of a team of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and one or more ground stations, can provide real-time monitoring and tracking of unfolding disaster events, as well as help with relief operations to avoid large scale losses of lives and property. This project brings together US and Indian experts working on autonomous UAS operations in the presence of environmental uncertainties and hazards. In particular, it seeks to understand how teams of autonomous UAVs could be used to maximize the data gathered and predict the intensity and spread of forest fires and floods. Through its outreach activities, this project team will also encourage students to participate in research on autonomous vehicles and inform the general public about the value of such research in addressing societal challenges. <br/><br/>Key research goals are to design and use nonlinearly stable and robust motion estimation and control schemes that enable a multi-UAV team to collaboratively follow desired trajectories for loitering, monitoring and tracking in the presence of disturbances like wind and air currents. Each UAV in the UAS is modeled as an actuated rigid body, making the UAS a multi-agent rigid body system (MARBS). Geometric controller and observer designs will be developed that are computationally light and can be implemented with commercially available sensors onboard rotorcraft UAVs. Sensor data from inertial sensors and point cloud sensors like depth cameras, will be combined using a continuous and finite-time stable extended state observer (ESO). This ESO will provide estimates of UAV motion states, relative pose of other UAVs within the range of point cloud sensors, and disturbance estimates. These estimates will be used by feedback tracking controllers that are designed to track desired trajectories in a stable manner while rejecting the disturbances, thereby providing active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). Both asymptotically stable and finite-time stable control laws will be designed, and the entire navigation and control system for a multi-UAV team will be tested in indoor and outdoor environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are sophisticated ways of organizing data so that a user can efficiently retrieve certain information about the data. Some applications have data gradually evolving over time, hence, data structures also need to be quickly reorganizable to reflect the data updates for such applications. A notable class of data structures are streaming algorithms, which process input data in the sequential order while using very small memory. A streaming algorithm maintains a data structure and keeps updating it as the input is being processed, without having to remember all the input data. This situation occurs wherever large amounts of data just move through, without being stored, and certain types of summary information have to be generated, as, e.g., in internet switches. This project aims to deepen the understanding of what efficient data structures and small space streaming algorithms can and cannot do. The project also creates opportunities for students to learn about small-space algorithms in a new graduate course and undergraduate seminars.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is the tradeoffs between memory consumption, running time and accuracy for data structures and streaming algorithms. This project studies both upper and lower bound questions in several directions, including the static dictionary problem, polynomial lower bounds for dynamic data structures, stronger lower bounds for dynamic data structures under space restrictions, as well as graph problems in multi-pass streaming, and algorithms for insertion-only streams.

These devices rely on carefully arranging particles under flowing conditions, a process often requiring the controlled movement of particles across the flow. Typically, this movement is achieved by using external fields like electricity, magnetism, acoustics, or optics, but this method has limitations and depends on specific particle properties. An alternative approach known as elasto-inertial focusing, instead balances natural forces within the flow to concentrate particles along the centerline of the device. While this approach promises a noninvasive way to achieve the desired particle movement, it has challenges. When dealing with certain types of fluids (polymeric or non-Newtonian), there is a limit to how fast particles can be processed due to the onset of elastic instabilities. To address these challenges, the research will develop novel experimental methods and numerical simulations that go beyond the limitations of microfluidic devices. Experiments and simulations together should provide a more thorough understanding of the distribution of velocity and particle patterns in both the fluid and particle phases. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge, this research has a broader impact on education. The team is committed to providing unique opportunities for interdisciplinary STEM education and training. The goal is to equip a diverse group of students and researchers to emerge as the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers. The planned outreach activities include creating hands-on activities for K-12 programs, with a focus on underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This project aims to uncover new and essential understandings of the physics involved in fluid flows carrying non-Brownian particles within complex solvents. The proposed effort combines highly resolved numerical simulations with the experiments, which include time-resolved and highly resolved planar particle image velocimetry (PIV), particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), focused specifically on suspensions of spherical particles in complex fluids. Using a comprehensive approach that integrates both numerical and experimental studies, the project explores specific conditions defined by considerations of particle concentrations and fluid rheological properties. The primary goal is to provide a better physical understanding of both the flow characteristics and instabilities in the presence of particles and complex fluids. A better understanding of these flows has implications for various industries, including inkjet printing, biomedical devices, and even enhanced oil recovery. This study has the potential to benefit society by providing valuable insights and tools for effectively managing particle-laden flows in practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MOFs are useful for a wide range of applications, from charge and ion transport, separations, gas- and solution-based sensing, catalysis, environmental remediation, and more. The formation of large-area separation membranes is especially significant for a range of gas separations, such as for CO2 removal from air or flue gas. Small-scale (1 cm2) MOF-based membranes have shown utility for a range of high-value separation applications. However, a lack of fundamental knowledge exists to develop easily scalable, advanced manufacturing process for large areas of MOF membranes that still preserve lab-scale performance. This award supports research using a combination of x-ray probes, modeling, and experimental techniques to fully understand how MOF thin films form. This fundamental knowledge is used to develop a continuous, roll-to-roll coating technique that can create large-area MOF thin films with outstanding separation performance. Students are engaged to contribute to the development of new MOF crystallization theories and modeling tools that can be used in research as well as industrial environments. The project endeavors to train students, particularly from underrepresented minority backgrounds, to become successful chemical engineers and material scientists. <br/><br/>Large area, scalable thin-film MOF formation required for low-resistance, low-cost separations is difficult to achieve due to limited know-how on controlling solution chemistry for precision synthesis of MOF thin films using a scalable solution coating process. This project uses an integrated approach involving in-situ experimentation, modeling, and separation measurements to perform fundamental manufacturing research on MOF thin film formation using scalable coating techniques, such as flow coating, or the recently developed percolation-assisted coating (PAC) method. Rapid timescale, in-situ x-ray scattering measurements coupled with microkinetic modeling are used to understand thin film MOF nucleation and growth mechanisms under evaporative/pervaporation conditions. The microkinetic model simulates billions of oligomerization reactions to predict nucleation rate, growth rate, and size distribution. The microkinetic model helps in selecting a range of operating conditions for high throughput (HT) PAC experiments for the optimization of MOF thin film structure and maximizing performance. By connecting it to a gas chromatograph, the HT setup is also used to obtain gas separation factors for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures. The ensuing process-structure-property relationships guide the scaling of the PAC method to grow 50 cm2  MOF films, followed by a model-based design of a roll-to-roll coating system for large-scale manufacturing of MOF films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When all the environmental information carried by the communication signal can be gleaned by base stations or user equipment, the communication network can infer the information and thus monitor the environment. The 5G networks further enhance the capability of sensing that cannot be achieved by 4G cellular networks, due to the features of large bandwidth, wide-area coverage, ultra-dense deployment, massive antennas, and network slicing.

Multiple undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to perform this research, preparing them for careers that increasingly demand integration of computational and experimental approaches to tackle scientific problems. A collaboration with the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History (UMMNH) will communicate stem cell research and its societal benefits to diverse audiences. To reach younger audiences, the researchers will partner with the UMMNH to develop a curriculum for teaching middle school students in underrepresented communities from metro-Detroit, as well as a small year-long exhibit and additional outreach activities at the museum.

This project uses human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as an in vitro model to address the mechanisms by which BMP controls cell fate decisions in early human development. Preliminary work revealed that differentiation of hPSCs to amnion-like cells does not depend on the level or duration of signaling separately, but only on the time integral, i.e. the total amount of signaling over time. This is contrary to the common assumption that signaling level is the main determinant of cell response and implies different molecular mechanisms for signal processing. A preliminary screen yielded genes whose levels are linearly related to the time integral of signaling, providing a simple potential mechanism, but how these genes are regulated by BMP and how they in turn control other genes is unclear. We also do not know if BMP integration is conserved across different contexts. Therefore, this project aims to 1) reveal the mechanisms underlying temporal integration of BMP signaling during amnion-like differentiation, 2) understand how signal response depends on the initial state of the cell, 3) determine if these mechanisms are conserved across different cell fate decisions and species. Together, this work will yield a more profound understanding of BMP signaling in pluripotent stem cells and contribute to revealing general principles by which dynamic signaling controls cell fate, enabling more reproducible stem cell differentiation in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The drag is known to increase when the relative velocity (correspondingly, the Reynolds number of the flow) increases, while many of the common drag reduction techniques are known to lose effectiveness with the increase in Reynolds number. This project will investigate the reasons for this loss of effectiveness and propose new strategies that may potentially overcome this limitation. In particular, a drag reduction mechanism in fluids flowing across a pipe that imparts a certain motion to the walls of the pipe will be considered. A hypothesis that specific parameters (such as frequency and wavelength) of such wall motions significantly influence the drag reduction will be investigated, via high-fidelity computational simulations across the range of Reynolds numbers. The project will also seek to improve the quality of education of fundamental mathematical and physical disciplines for the engineering students, via enhancing the course curriculum, engaging undergraduate students in research, and conducting outreach activities to underrepresented students across the metropolitan Phoenix area.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the hypothesis that the loss of performance of some common drag reduction mechanisms with increase in Reynolds number is associated with the increasing influence of large scales which may not be efficiently controlled by conventional drag reduction mechanisms. In particular, the traditional inner-scaled actuation and a less investigated outer-scaled actuation mechanisms will be compared and analyzed on an example of a turbulent pipe flow with streamwise traveling waves of transverse wall velocity as a drag reduction mechanism. Depending on the frequency and the wavelength of a traveling wave, different scales of motions in a turbulent flow will be actuated, and their role in drag reduction depending on the Reynolds number will be quantified. Additionally, a novel approach that targets small and large scales of flow simultaneously, termed a multi-scaled actuation, will be investigated. This new approach promises to overcome the limitations of previously explored methods, especially at high Reynolds number flows. Enhancing the capabilities to reduce skin friction drag at increased Reynolds numbers, approaching the target for realistic applications, will have a strong impact on the world economy, global energy usage, and emission reductions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impacts included major damage to the surrounding region and a number of hurricane-related deaths. The city of Wilmington, NC entirely was cut off by historic flooding from the Cape Fear River. The dense population and development along its coastline continues to leave South Carolina communities highly vulnerable to coastal flooding from these seasonal hurricane events. The major causes of hurricane-related flooding events are the coastal storm surge caused by extreme winds and/or the occurrence of concentrated and extreme precipitation within vulnerable, flood prone areas. During flooding events, perishable data, such as high-water marks, are potential evidence of the highest water levels during a flood and they provide valuable data for understanding extreme flood events. In this study, valuable information will be obtained from such perishable data through field visits. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this research project is to visit the locations of coastal flooding to investigate (a) the reliability of the weather forecast in terms of different spatio-temporal scales for extreme rainfalls, and (b) the joint probability of extreme rainfall and storm surge to gain insight into an increase in flood risk under hurricane scenarios. This research projects aims to amass data with which stakeholders can improve their current design standards for future flooding preparedness. The PI also expects (c) to utilize observed and collected perishable data in developing a statistical modeling framework both to generate spatial risk maps and to identify critical vulnerabilities of important coastal infrastructure regarding compound events. Such information is critical for maintaining coastal infrastructure networks and for providing alerts during extreme events. This research project will advance knowledge about the influence of extreme rainfall and storm surge on coastal flooding as well as the potential impact of such events on environmental sustainability. By documenting perishable data, the research project provides an excellent opportunity to study the compounding effect of two extreme weather events at multiple locations and to estimate the return period for such events with respect to historical periods. The research results will be used to develop strategies for improving awareness about compound extreme events amongst stakeholders to minimize flooding impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, wearable devices such as physical activity trackers, continuous glucose monitors and ambulatory blood pressure monitors are worn concurrently to provide measurements of distinct subjects? characteristics. There is enormous potential in integrating that concurrent information from the distinct vantages to better understand between-view associations and improve prediction of health outcomes. Existing tools for data integration are sensitive to outliers, and are not designed for mixed data types (e.g. continuous skewed glucose measurements, zero-inflated activity counts, binary indicators of sleep/wake). The PI will develop a more robust framework for multi-view data integration that is better able to account for outliers, better match the mixed types of data actually collected, and be more accurate in separating common from view-specific signals. The new methods will be implemented in open-source software accompanied by reproducible workflow examples, providing immediate and easy access for other researchers. The educational component centers on the development of structured research experiences (SRE) for students. SRE enhances students written communication, software development and reproducible research skills, all of which are lacking in traditional curriculum. This will improve students? preparation for conducting research, and widen their STEM employment opportunities. The involvement of students from traditionally underrepresented groups will positively impact their retention rate and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Popular dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, are tailored for single-view data, and thus fail to discover coordinated multi-view signals on a global level. On the other hand, existing multi-view dimension reduction methods suffer from reliance on the Gaussianity assumption, an inability to capture joint functional signals, and a lack of theoretical guarantees. The PI will address these drawbacks by (i) developing a joint dimension reduction framework for skewed continuous, binary and zero-inflated view types; (ii) a joint dimension reduction framework for mixed functional multi-view data and (iii) a new paradigm for simultaneous extraction of signals across views based on hierarchical low-rank constraints.  This work will lead to critically needed new statistical methods for data integration with direct relevance for researchers working with wearable monitors, microbiome and multi-omics data through interdisciplinary collaborations of the PI. The proposed structured research experiences will center on the design and reproducibility of simulations studies, and align with computational components of the proposed research, including direct students? involvement in multiple simulation studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project contains three thrusts, listed from the most well-defined to the most exploratory.  The first thrust involves analyzing genomic data in order to investigate tumor evolution trees that lead to the development of cancer.  The second involves analyzing faulty data generated by computer networks while utilizing information about the network such as its topology and delay pattern.  The third is exploring other areas for which the techniques developed for the first two thrusts apply, making progress towards the goal of developing general techniques for analyzing faulty data in the absence of a known ground truth using domain information.<br/><br/>In the model that this project assumes, the input contains errors that have been probabilistically generated according to a known distribution in unknown locations.  The goal that the investigator would like to explore is the creation of sampling techniques that do not blindly take random samples from the prohibitively large space for the ground truth; rather, it is to use the knowledge about restrictions that limit the possible space that could have led to the noisy input and analyze this much smaller space.  In particular, the first focus of this project is to explore how such information can be used to generate efficient sampling techniques in order to infer properties of tumor progression trees, and, later on, more general phylogenetic trees.  Later parts of this project involve applying this knowledge to routing graphs and other data with underlying well-structured graphs.  Since such techniques rely on graph-theoretic assumptions underlying the inputs, the goal for all three thrusts is to develop widely applicable probabilistic techniques that will help one analyze noisy graph information in general, pushing existing theoretical knowledge forward, as well as bringing a better understanding to applied areas with strong theoretical underpinnings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These programs will profoundly impact human health, climate targets, energy supplies, food security, agriculture, supply chain resilience, and national security. Incomplete understanding of the reasons for poor synthetic program robustness and lack of reliability, and an inability to predict the emergent behavior of biosystem interactions, are great engineering challenges. Such incomplete understanding is due to complex biological interactions at multiple structural and temporal scales, as well as nonlinearities, stochasticity, non-modularity, and measurement difficulties when organisms are alive. Consequently, synthetic programs often have unintended behaviors and limited functionality. To increase program functionality, this project will investigate adding new control programs that are external to the biology, a ""cyber-biological system."" Output biological protein and molecule production will be regulated via external sensing, computation, and actuation. This project will also encourage early enthusiasm in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by adding blood clotting concepts to a popular game with high female play. Gains in bioengineering stimulation and engagement over baseline will be assessed.<br/><br/>The state-of-the-art in cyber-biological control is to overcome biological complexity when testing new program function by restricting program use to single celled model organisms, single triggers to a biological cascade, or a single environment condition, often with a single disturbance. The research goal of this project is to further this state-of-the-art via a unique yet broadly-applicable testbed of blood coagulation control, which will enable functional programs for mammalian systems that have multiple interacting cells, proteins, and small molecules, and that encompass multiple functions and timescales while subject to multiple disturbances. Thus, this project will: (1) establish the control of safety-critical biological systems with characteristic nonlinearities; (2) extend powerful and pervasive linear feedback control design methods for use with nonlinear biochemical dynamics; and (3) compensate for innate biological stochasticity. These aims will respectively address knowledge gaps in control, analysis, and diagnostics. Nonlinear control advances will apply to nonnegative systems beyond biology such as manufacturing plants, thermodynamics, air traffic flow, multi-agent communication, network congestion, filtering, sampled data, and economics. Testbed experiments will drive integration.

To protect individual privacy, many organizations, both from the public and private sectors, have adopted differential privacy as a rigorous privacy measure. However, recent deployments of differential privacy have revealed key research gaps. First, much of the existing theoretical work in differential privacy focuses on worst-case analyses, which often lead to overly pessimistic results and fail to inform algorithm design in practice. Despite recent advancements, differentially private algorithms for machine learning and data sharing are still not widely adopted technologies. Lastly, the lack of comprehensive tools for privacy risk assessment makes it difficult for practitioners to evaluate the effectiveness of differential privacy and to determine appropriate privacy risk parameters.   This project aims to address these challenges in differential privacy by expanding the repertoire of privacy-preserving algorithms and developing auditing mechanisms to assess the privacy protection these algorithms provide.<br/><br/>The research focuses on two fundamental and closely related problems: private learning and private synthetic data. In private learning, the goal is to learn accurate machine learning models using sensitive data with differential privacy guarantees. In private synthetic data, the goal is to differentially privately generate a synthetic dataset that preserves important statistical trends of the sensitive dataset. The project advances the frontiers of these two problems with three research thrusts. The first thrust develops a theoretical framework that goes beyond pessimistic worst-case analyses to better capture practical scenarios and guide algorithm design. The second thrust designs practical algorithms that are informed by theoretical principles and empirical structures of the problems in practice. The third focuses on privacy attacks and auditing mechanisms that evaluate the privacy risks of learning and synthetic data algorithms.

However, this requires the construction of large-scale energy infrastructure that can be energy- and cost-intensive during manufacturing and decommissioning. In particular, there are critical sustainability challenges in the manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades. These challenges originate from the permanent nature of the fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer composites that underlie the structure of wind turbine blades. This CiviL Infrastructure research for climate change Mitigation and Adaptation (CLIMA) award supports fundamental research that accelerates the discovery of a new family of polymers, Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs), and their composites that are mechanically strong yet reversible to enable recycling, repairing, and reprocessing. Knowledge to be obtained from this project facilitates cost-effective manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades, thereby improving the competitiveness and sustainability of wind energy in the global clean energy landscape and augmenting U.S. industry and economy. Additionally, this project supports outreach activities to engage researchers in national laboratories and the wind energy industry, educate K-12 students in composites, organic materials, computer-aided design and clean energy, recruit undergraduate researchers especially underrepresented groups, and enrich curricula through guest lectures.<br/><br/>Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs) are polymers crosslinked by covalent bonds that become reversible upon heating or other external stimuli. They combine the structural stability of thermosets and the malleability of thermoplastics. This project aims to establish a systematic research framework to discover new CANs and their composites to meet the multi-faceted requirements of material properties posed by the manufacturing, operation, and recycling of wind turbine blades. The research features an interdisciplinary collaboration among mechanics, materials, and manufacturing, and includes three components: molecular design, organic material synthesis, and mechanics of the new polymers. For molecular design, a cyber-platform combining machine learning and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is created to generate candidate monomers of CANs. The synthesis component establishes a feasible molecular design space and allows CAN polymers to be synthesized from candidate monomers for manufacturing and testing. The mechanics component focuses on testing and modeling the mechanical behavior of the CAN polymers. The three components are integrated by preparing coupon-scale CAN composite samples and benchmarking their mechanical properties against the thermoset composites currently used in wind turbine blades. Manufacturing and recycling processes such as vacuum bag molding, thermoforming, lamination and chemical dissolution of CAN composites and the effects of processing conditions are also investigated. <br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) and the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) programs of the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrification has been a hallmark of modern society. However, due to the high demand of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and consumer products, the ever-increasing amount of waste is a critical concern. The development of green and cost-effective recycling of lithium-ion battery cathodes is of utmost importance, also to mitigate accessibility issues for critical minerals. This project investigates a new approach of utilizing microorganisms for the recovery of key battery cathode minerals (such as nickel, cobalt, manganese, and lithium). Known as biohydrometallurgy, the project?s battery recycling approach promises to address concerns associated with traditional recycling methods that rely on either energy-intensive high temperature methods or toxic/corrosive processing chemicals. Instead, the principal investigators rely on living organisms to accomplish the recovery of metals from spent batteries. This project builds on transformative recent successes in using microorganisms for such purpose but takes a fundamental step forward through the exploration of powering the functionality of the living organisms using materials already available in waste batteries in a green, self-sufficient fashion. The concept promises to transform how battery materials are reused. The research could contribute significantly to the goal of powering the society with energy from clean renewable sources. Educational efforts to broaden the impacts of the project include hosting high school students during the summer and reaching out to sports fans during Boston College?s game days. Moreover, complementary outreach activities are developed to educate the public about the implications of materials research for a sustainable future.<br/><br/>The project will address how spent lithium-ion batteries (LIB) can be recycled using a biohydrometallurgy approach. This project responds to an emerging critical challenge due to the rapid accumulation of spent batteries as a result of recent LIB proliferation, and it could transform how spent batteries are recycled for the recovery of critical minerals. Prof. Wang, a material chemist, and Prof. Momeni, a microbiologist, examine Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans (Atf), a class of bacteria that uses inorganic compounds as a source of energy and survive in extremely acidic environments, as a potential medium for self-sustained LIB recycling. The key innovation is to utilize iron that is abundant in the scrap metal of the spent battery casing as the main food source to sustain the growth and reproduction of the bacteria, whose natural metabolism produces acidic solutions to leach key minerals, including Ni, Mn, and Co, from spent batteries. This project promises a recycling scheme that requires minimum transportation of toxic and/or corrosive chemicals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These waves can then be tuned, coupled to each other, propagated preferentially, or even completely canceled, thanks to the unique properties of the medium. As such, this study will advance our understanding of wave propagation in novel materials and develop the nanotechnology necessary for harnessing these waves. Among the numerous envisioned applications are electro-acoustic signal processing components intended for use in communications, national security, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology.

Modern applications, however, require more than compression. In domains such as computational biology, terabytes of highly compressible data are generated at an increasing rate. To fully take advantage of this data, it needs to be not only stored in a small space but also accessible and searchable. Recent years have witnessed the birth of data structures called ""compressed indexes"" that can accomplish this task. The research so far, however, has mostly focused on static indexes, leaving out important aspects such as support for updates and efficient construction. This project's overarching goal is to develop powerful, dynamic compressed indexes capable of handling a versatile set of queries and various representations, that can moreover be efficiently constructed. This will make it significantly cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient to store and share highly compressible datasets such as DNA collections, thereby fully unlocking the potential of advances in DNA sequencing. The advances of this project will also be integrated into research experience for underrepresented students, as well as outreach to non-computer science students.<br/><br/>The main research goals of this project can be broadly classified into the following three directions. First, the project will lead to new efficient algorithms for constructing compressed indexes. The new approach lies in first preprocessing the input using lightly sub-optimal compression and then constructing the final index in compressed time, i.e., time proportional to the precompressed text. Second, the project aims to utilize and improve modern suffix sampling techniques to design new and powerful indexes that are both compressed and able to support powerful queries, including multi-string representations. Finally, the project will study the underdeveloped landscape of lower bounds for compressed indexes. Currently, only the most basic queries, such as random access, are well-understood, and much less is known about lower bounds on more versatile representations or lower bounds for compressed computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The loss of hand function can dramatically change a person?s daily life, forcing them to rely on caregivers to provide assistance. This project aims to develop sensor-embedded garments designed to monitor muscle activity in individuals with tetraplegia resulting from spinal cord injuries. This sensorized garment detects muscle activity in the upper body, even for many people with spinal cord injuries who have lost hand mobility. By decoding and translating these muscle activities, the garment empowers individuals to take control of an assistive robot to perform a variety of household and self-care tasks, such as preparing and eating meals independently and conducting household chores. This research is poised to impact society by restoring a degree of autonomy and agency to individuals with spinal cord injury, promoting open-source development in wearable sensing, integrating research findings into classroom materials, and fostering inclusive education and mentorship for high school students from communities underserved in STEM.<br/><br/>This collaborative project between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh will introduce a high-density electromyography (HDEMG) wearable to capture neuromuscular signals and enable individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) to embody a physically assistive mobile manipulator. Towards this goal, the research project will make key foundational contributions along three thrusts: (1) The design of a sensorized upper-body garment embedded with HDEMG arrays, allowing the capture of residual myoelectric activity and recognition of gesture intent in individuals with SCI. The research team will develop learning-based pattern recognition techniques to interpret the myoelectric activity patterns of attempted arm, wrist, and hand gestures and predict the underlying motor function intent. (2) Development of an interface that enables individuals with SCI to embody an assistive robot by mapping myoelectric signals and inferred gestures to actuator control. The sensorized garment is designed to be comfortable and wearable throughout an entire day, which also necessitates the development of real-time calibration algorithms that allow for accurate myoelectric activity sensing over extended periods of time. (3) The team will conduct a series of in-lab evaluations with stakeholders in collaboration with our community partners. Individuals with SCI will use the wearable to teleoperate an assistive mobile manipulator and perform a range of physical household and self-care activities. These studies will quantify technology performance and efficacy, assess safety, and support iterative refinement and improvements to the key technology components with stakeholder feedback.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While sunlight and carbon dioxide are usually plentiful, water and mineral nutrients are often limiting factors for plant growth, making irrigation and fertilizers the two most costly inputs for crop production and sustainable agriculture. However, reliance on fertilizers is not a long-term solution because both production and application of fertilizers cause pollution and threaten the sustainability of our environment. An alternative strategy is to breed crops with high nutrient use efficiency, but this requires understanding how plants acquire and utilize each nutrient, which is the subject of this research project. Discoveries from the project will be applied to crop improvement through ongoing collaborations with international and USDA labs associated with the PI?s laboratory. The research will have an additional impact on undergraduate and graduate education through courses the PI teaches at UC Berkeley and through independent research programs in the PI?s laboratory. The project will also enhance the outreach efforts that focus on local high schools to encourage students to become interested in biology. <br/><br/>Membrane transport is important for mineral nutrient homeostasis at the cell and whole plant level. To thrive, plants have evolved intricate mechanisms that maintain mineral homeostasis at the cellular and whole-plant level despite constantly changing nutrient status in soil. The PI?s lab discovered the calcium response modules (CBL-CIPK) that form a signaling network for nutrient sensing. New results indicate that plants also utilize a conserved nutrient sensor, TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR), to integrate the high potassium (K) nutrient status to initiate ?growth mode? and suppress the low-K response by degrading the CBL-CIPK modules. In a reciprocal manner, low-K-induced activation of CBL-CIPK network represses TOR activity and switch plants to ?adaptation mode?, establishing a conceptual framework on how plants adapt to the changing nutrient status in the soil. The same CBL-CIPK network activates sequestration of magnesium (Mg) into vacuole in response to high-Mg, providing a possible mechanism for integrating different nutrients cues. The recent discovery of Mg-transporters responsible for Mg-sequestration into (and remobilization out of) the vacuole set the stage for connecting the CBL-CIPK modules to the Mg-transporters, constructing a molecular relay from high Mg status in the serpentine soils (the signal), to the activation of CBL-CIPK modules (the signaling), and Mg sequestration into the vacuole (the response). The specific objectives of this project are: 1. To identify the mechanisms by which the dual CBL-CIPK pathways are activated by low-K status; 2. To identify the events leading to K-induced activation of TOR and inactivation of CBL-CIPK network; and 3. To dissect the CBL-CIPK pathway that governs Mg fluxes across the tonoplast. The research will benefit from the unique expertise of PI?s group in the model plant systems that are amenable to patch-clamp and cell biology analysis in combination with genetic and biochemical approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has been the gold standard for over three decades and has been an effective technique to acquire two-dimensional flow information.  Tomographic PIV emerged as a flow measurement technique to obtain three-dimensional (3D) flow information in complex fluid flow scenarios.  However, this method is costly as it requires a multiple camera setup (typically 4 to 6 expensive cameras), a complex flow image reconstruction technique and the results are typically limited to the camera alignment which often results in poor axial resolution.  Recent work has shown that it is possible to obtain 3D PIV measurements using a single light field camera setup.  However, the axial resolution remains limited.  As a result, this research project aims to address these limitations by developing and validating a novel 3D PIV technique that incorporates a single light field color camera, a high energy pulsed rainbow illumination beam for generating color coded and particle depth information, and an in-house developed particle and flow reconstruction algorithm.  This method will improve limitations in axial resolution and will significantly advance capabilities of fluid flow measurement systems in academia, industry, and national laboratories. The particle and flow algorithms and validations will be disseminated to a wide range of potential users.  The educational component of this research will translate engineering analysis research to the classroom and enhance engineering recruitment and retention by targeting students from community colleges and university undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a novel technique for 3D PIV that incorporates a single light-field camera, a high-energy pulse color-depth encoded beam, an alternating direction of multipliers (ADMM) and modified Horn-Schunck optical flow algorithm for particle position and flow reconstruction. Fundamentally, the light field camera will capture two-dimensional (2D) angular, spatial, and color-depth encoded information of particles illuminated by the high-energy beam, providing higher resolution particle reconstruction compared to current 3D PIV approaches. This research effort will address issues related to system development, system calibration, validation of measurements, and examining the technique?s ability to achieve 3D flow measurements in complex flow experiments with improved axial resolution. If successful, this novel technique will provide high 3D axial resolution measurement capabilities to researchers and engineers in all areas ranging from aeronautics to biomedical, thus having an indirect yet very broad impact on the nation?s industrial and research infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-speed images of a free-flying hawkmoth showed the insect -- after being impulsively accelerated to a spin rate of 5,000 degrees per second -- returning to normal flight in only a few wing beats. Computer simulations suggest that this rapid recovery may be due to a spring-like force from the air displaced by the sudden motion of the moth?s body. These forces were not previously thought to be important in hawkmoth flight. This project will use mathematical analyses and high-fidelity computer simulations to fully explore and explain this surprising result. The knowledge gained from this work will help safeguard future aircraft; the observed behavior is beyond the capability of current flight control technology.   <br/><br/>Preliminary analysis suggests that the body-added mass effect plays a central role in the observed ability of the hawkmoth to recover from impulsive acceleration to high pitch rates.

Specific tasks include (i) dynamic analysis of body added mass effects and comparison to existing insect flight disturbance response data; (ii) high-fidelity computational fluid dynamic simulations of added mass effects, and (iii) analysis of added mass effects in the presence of vortical flow.

Detailing the analysis of the interactions at the molecular level will be used to develop a set of rational design rules. These rules will guide the engineering of SP-D variants with enhanced capabilities for glycan binding, particularly tailored to target Influenza A structures.

The database, G-Forge, will consist of a vast set of G-code files, the instructions that drive 3D printers, along with efficient tools for querying, reasoning about, and translating those files. Those capabilities will be enabled by recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs). This approach affords many advantages over the current state of the art, including early identification of potential errors in manufacturing plans and fast, step-by-step debugging of code, thereby reducing errors and delays. It is expected that G-Forge, once demonstrated for 3D printing, can be extended to other numerically controlled machine tools to redefine traditional workflows, significantly reducing errors and costs. The project's multidisciplinary components will be integrated into a broader educational effort to offer students a solid foundation in the critical interdisciplinary area of cyber manufacturing and will ultimately support economic competitiveness, national security, and workforce development.<br/> <br/>G-Forge is a multimodal LLM for additive manufacturing that will be trained using computer-aided design (CAD) models and G-code. The LLM can be considered an information encoder that compiles the information from input data of various modalities into an embedding. That embedding can be used for different downstream tasks, such as verification, debugging, and indexing of a potentially vast set of G-Code files. Because of its multi-faceted utility, it is expected that manufacturers will widely adopt G-Forge, incentivizing them to participate in creating a shared G-code database. G-Forge will lay the foundations of a larger ecosystem akin to 'Google for Manufacturing,' enabling users to perform numerous downstream tasks such as design retrieval and recommendation and automated shape generation. This vision incorporates the following specific objectives: G-Code Verification and Debugging: the core component of G-Forge will be an LLM-powered tool that can assess whether the part specified in a given G-Code file is valid for a particular machine tool; A Community-Driven G-Code Database: Users interacting with G-Forge will aid in the creation of a large library of verified G-Code; G-Code Analysis as a Service: With increasing community usage, we envision the G-Forge database will grow over time, eventually serving as a valuable source of training data for a multimodal foundation model specifically tuned for G-code. The education and outreach plans of the research include: (1) the development of AI in manufacturing certificate programs at Iowa State University (ISU) and New York University (NYU), and (2) developing modules for existing courses in a cyber-physical systems minor and a new lab module in cyber manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-speed images of a free-flying hawkmoth showed the insect -- after being impulsively accelerated to a spin rate of 5,000 degrees per second -- returning to normal flight in only a few wing beats. Computer simulations suggest that this rapid recovery may be due to a spring-like force from the air displaced by the sudden motion of the moth?s body. These forces were not previously thought to be important in hawkmoth flight. This project will use mathematical analyses and high-fidelity computer simulations to fully explore and explain this surprising result. The knowledge gained from this work will help safeguard future aircraft; the observed behavior is beyond the capability of current flight control technology.   <br/><br/>Preliminary analysis suggests that the body-added mass effect plays a central role in the observed ability of the hawkmoth to recover from impulsive acceleration to high pitch rates. This study will apply a combination of theoretical and computational methods to understand the interplay between body flight dynamics and unsteady flow, at timescales significantly faster than the wing beat period. Specific tasks include (i) dynamic analysis of body added mass effects and comparison to existing insect flight disturbance response data; (ii) high-fidelity computational fluid dynamic simulations of added mass effects, and (iii) analysis of added mass effects in the presence of vortical flow.

Carbon blocks and coatings are widely used to control friction and wear of sliding interfaces in manufacturing processes or manufactured goods. This project focuses on understanding and improving tribochemical properties of thermally-synthesized carbon (TSC) materials for the application where low friction is beneficial. Polycrystalline graphite powders and other TSC materials show relatively high friction, although superlubricity is readily observed on the basal plane of graphite and for hydrogenated diamond-like carbon produced via plasma enhanced deposition process. This raises an important question ? what controls superlubricous behaviors of different types of carbon materials? Addressing this question can lead to a better design of carbon materials that can be used as carbon brushes for electrical motors or generators and/or mechanical seals in which oil or grease lubrication cannot be employed. Reduction of friction and wear of these components will greatly improve energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. These issues are important in new energy applications and hence US competitiveness. Morgan Advanced Materials is participating as the GOALI partner and will provide commercial and custom-designed carbon materials for the study. The project will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students in the Penn State Commonwealth system. The surface analysis results of this project will be integrated with graduate-level education. <br/><br/>Two hypotheses will be studied: (i) Friction of carbon materials depends on the distribution of sp2 and sp3 hybridizations and how they are connected to form the amorphous network, which varies with synthesis method. (ii) The chemical activity of reactive sites exposed at the sliding interface also varies depending on how carbon materials are synthesized. Studying these hypotheses requires the analysis of shear-induced structural transforms and chemical reactions occurring at the frictional interface; but that interface is not readily accessible for in-situ characterization. Alternately, relevant information can be deduced from the ex-situ analysis of the transfer film on the counter-surface formed from different carbon materials. This is because friction is a non-equilibrium process, and the final state of the transfer film will be a function of the initial state and the condition during friction. Various spectroscopic techniques will be employed to analyze the transfer film to identify tribochemical parameters governing friction and wear behaviors of thermally-synthesized carbon materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant will develop efficient surrogate modeling methods to predict design performance in the presence of such discontinuities which can then be exploited in design optimization. This work will facilitate the solution of complex engineering design problems and will be evaluated in the design of a smart manufacturing system for carbon nanotubes, and the design of automated material handling systems. The award will also contribute to the development of a data science-capable workforce by providing multidisciplinary research, training, and international collaboration opportunities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. The research team will broadly disseminate their research findings and share data and the resulting software packages to the data science and systems engineering community. <br/><br/>This research will make substantial contributions to the areas of surrogate modeling, sequential design, active learning, system design, and advanced manufacturing. System performance is modeled as a piece-wise continuous function of design variables, motivating local Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling. The approach accommodates regime changes around a prediction location, segmenting local data based on the estimated partition(s). Only the local data belonging to the same regime as a prediction location affects the model prediction. Research activities will explore two ideas: (1) local GP modeling with local data selection; and (2) smoother alternatives that augment design variables with probabilistic regime estimates.

The genes for the putative SL biosynthetic pathway will be cloned into microbial systems and expressed. Three specific objectives will be pursued. First, the recently established SL-producing microbial consortia will be optimized for SL production. Then, the mechanisms driving SL biosynthesis in cereal crops, specifically sorghum and maize, will be elucidated. Finally, efforts will be made to establish single-cell SL bioproduction. This project could provide a significant step towards (1) advancing the foundational understanding of plant specialized metabolism, (2) promoting the discovery and utilization of novel phytochemicals for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications, and (3) developing next-generation precision agriculture with enhanced productivity and resilience.

However, it is still very challenging to massively bring heterogeneous drones by many different manufacturers to real-world applications. One main reason is that, whenever a new drone is built, the planning and control algorithms for the drone usually have to be designed very carefully and the actions for the drone to take usually have to be laboriously programmed with considerable tuning effort. To remove, if not lessen, such limitations, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project establishes a novel learning-based framework that equips drones with new capabilities of ""learning from the experience"" of other drones despite their different dynamics and platforms. This approach to design of planning and control of drones will significantly reduce the design, test, evaluation and certification of drones, uniquely and efficiently customized for applications in their operating environment. The integrated research-and-education activities will provide students in the Western New York area with hands-on experience and internship opportunities on drone techniques, toward better preparing the future workforce for the unmanned aerial system industry in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will establish a novel learning-based feedforward control framework and equip drones with new capabilities for learning three particular skills, i.e., (1) how to generate a dynamically feasible trajectory, (2) how to sense and compensate external disturbances, and (3) how to learn from others' learned experience, called ""dynamic learning."" These three skills are crucial for drones to perform complex tasks, and the foundation for understanding of how one robot could efficiently learn from the experiences gathered by other robots with different dynamics. Key to this approach is an architecture that automatically adjusts the original outputs of the baseline planners and controllers by adding feedforward learning signals to improve drone's flight performance. This learning framework is neither to completely replace the existing planning and control methods nor to compete for the highest optimized performance possible but rather to provide an elegant learning mechanism that is highly adaptable and reasonably efficient involving minimal hardware modification and software reconfiguration for commodity drones.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many governmental and private institutions are adopting Open Data Principles that state that the shared data is complete, accurate, and timely.  These properties make this data of great value to data scientists, journalists, and the public.  When Open Data is used effectively, data scientists can explore and analyze open resources, which in turn allows them to investigate public policy, create new scientific knowledge, and discover new (hidden) value useful for social, scientific, or economic initiatives.  Though the open data movement has succeeded in its ambition of making data accessible, it has not succeed in making this valuable data easy to use. The overarching goal of this project is to address this shortcoming.<br/><br/>In this project, we present a vision for Open Data Curation - data curation that is open, transparent, and explainable.  Open Data Curation uses an on-demand integration paradigm that spans data discovery, data cleaning and linking, and data integration.  Our vision is to enable users to query heterogeneous data stored in a data repository with minimal up-front effort.  Users can reference concepts and attributes in their queries that do not exist in the data.  An on-demand integration system (ODIS) responds to such requests by automatically determining what data could be transformed and integrated to provide data for a requested concept.  In terms of societal impact, the project will provide the algorithmic innovations to make effective, intuitive on-demand integration over open data lakes a reality.  Our solutions will use real open data and will be robust to the sometimes quirky, and always diverse, characteristics of open data.  We believe a profound shift in how people think about data integration and curation is needed to fuel the data science revolution which is being held back by incoherent data curation - a task that is still considered one of the most time consuming, annoying, and error-prone in data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disassembly, the first step of recycling, is more complex than assembly since there is much more variability in product type and, as a result, remanufacturing is usually not profitable. This award supports research to provide the fundamental understanding needed for the development of a novel robotic system that can effectively perform high-precision disassembly operations and make them practically and economically viable. The work has potential to mitigate labor shortages in recycling industry, reduce electronics waste, and revolutionize the remanufacturing of high-precision electronics.

Such acoustic metamaterials will enable high energy transmission at high frequency through sound barriers, including those with strong intrinsic loss like skull for brain imaging and brain-machine interface. Transcranial ultrasound (i.e. ultrasound transmission through skull) has many applications including noninvasive surgeries and drug delivery. However, current transcranial ultrasound techniques are all based on sound waves with relatively low frequency and poor spatial resolution, and the energy transmission through the lossy skull is low even for such low frequency sound waves. Brain imaging and brain-machine interfaces require better spatial resolution, which can be realzied by enabling transmission of high frequency ultrasound through skulls, which is not achievable with existing technologies. Active non-Hermitian complementary acoustic metamaterials (NHCMM) are promising compensation media to complement with the strong transmission loss through skull for high frequency acoustic waves. This project explores the acoustic and material properties of PZT-hydrogel composites integrated with feedback control circuits for the experimental realization of NHCMM that can compensate the high frequency ultrasound transmission loss through a real skull. This experimental realization will set the foundation for high resolution ultrasound brain imaging and brain-machine interface. This research will have broader impacts in science, defense, industry and general society by satisfying the critical need for high performance brain imaging and brain-machine interface. In addition, this research will promote the progress of fundamental acoustics, soft matter physics, and metamaterials. This multi-disciplinary research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering and positively impact STEM education.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to design, fabricate, and experimentally characterize an active NHCMM by integrating PZT elements, hydrogel, and feedback control circuits that can be used to complement sound barriers, including those with strong intrinsic loss such as skull, to achieve optimal energy transmission for brain imaging and brain-machine interface. The NHCMM has effective density and bulk modulus with negative values of that of the barrier to suppress the strong impedance mismatch and material gain that balances the intrinsic loss in the barrier. The NHCMM will be realized by integrating piezoelectric elements and hydrogel with electrical circuit components. The integrated feedback control circuit will actively modulate the effective acoustic properties of the metamaterials to realize the desired parameters of NHCMM and compensate impedance mismatch and loss simultaneously. This fundamental research project will pave the road for the realization of noninvasive ultrasonic brain imaging, high intensity focused ultrasound treatments, brain stimulation, and brain-machine interface. To achieve the proposed objective, the two PIs will utilize their complemented expertise in acoustics, metamaterials, and soft matter to accomplish the following research tasks: 1) Identify the dynamic properties of different types of hydrogels in a wide ultrasonic frequency band; 2) Design and fabricate hydrogel-based active NHCMMs with feedback-circuit-controlled piezoelectric elements to realize any desired effective density and bulk modulus with acoustic gain; 3) Characterize and optimize NHCMMs to enhance acoustic energy transmission through lossy skull for brain imaging and brain-machine interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are particularly advantageous due to their simplicity and interpretability, making them well-suited for decision-making tasks, compared to complex neural networks that can be difficult to understand. However, despite their benefits, tree models are not immune to security and privacy concerns. Malicious actors can tamper with tree models or steal intellectual property, posing threats to the integrity and confidentiality of machine learning systems. Further, although there are studies of similar attacks on neural networks, differences between how neural networks and tree models work may affect how well those existing findings apply to tree models. Together, these issues mean there are a number of open questions around enhancing the security and trustworthiness of tree models. This project aims to develop novel strategies to address these questions and develop more robust and trustworthy AI-based systems, and develop both tools and educational opportunities through the work to make the findings widely available and impactful. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the need for robust model authentication, watermarking for intellectual property tracing, machine unlearning for data privacy, and defense against backdoor attacks for tree models. The technical aims are organized around four tasks: a) Pursuing model identification by embedding unique signatures to generate differently embedded models; b) Developing novel methodologies of robust watermarking for tree models, for the purpose of tracing intellectual property; c) Designing novel algorithms for machine unlearning in tree models by exploiting tree reconstruction, residual-stable split, and combination of tree techniques; and d) Investigating the implications of backdoor attacks against tree models by leveraging the insights from the above tasks on tweaking tree models without significantly impacting the accuracy. These research efforts will contribute to the advancement of tree model security and trustworthiness, ensuring that these models can be reliably deployed in real-world applications while mitigating the risk of malicious attacks, unauthorized access, and privacy breaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our society uses algorithms to solve problems ranging from making investment decisions in personal financial planning, to allocating resources in large-scale computing systems such as data centers. Often, these problems are difficult because of uncertainty about the future. In algorithmic theory, traditionally conservative approaches are used which provide relatively weak but highly robust guarantees that hold no matter how the future unfolds. In practice, a more promising alternative is the use of machine-learning techniques to make algorithmic choices for the future based on knowledge of past data. By implicitly assuming that the future will mirror the past, one can provide stronger guarantees and better empirical performance. However, the ""worst-case"" robustness of the previous approach is not available, which is important if the implicit assumption of 'past predicts the future' no longer holds true. This project seeks to combine the two approaches and get the best of both worlds by exploring the interface between algorithm design and machine learning. The end goal is a comprehensive toolbox for algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty that is both robust and has good performance. In addition to this research component, the project will train graduate and undergraduate researchers in theoretical computer science, with an emphasis on participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigators' approach is to rethink each of these individual toolboxes to take advantage of the other -- namely incorporating machine-learned advice in algorithm design, and conversely, training machine learning models for algorithmic objectives. The main intellectual thrust of this project is to use machine-learned predictions to improve the quality of algorithms, and conversely, to design learning models that can be specifically trained for optimization objectives. This will be explored in two main directions: the first part considers Machine Learning as a Black Box. Here, the optimization algorithm merely consumes the predictions from the learning model. This is often the case in practice, particularly when the predictions are generated by complex systems such as deep neural networks. In this case, the focus will be on ensuring that we do not over-fit the predictions, on deciding what input parameters to predict in the first place, and on choosing between multiple alternative prediction models based on their relative accuracy, reliability, and costs. In the second part (Machine Learning as a White Box), the focus is on a more integrated design, where the optimization algorithm interacts with the learning model at runtime and ask adaptives queries. More ambitiously, the project explores a significant redesign of the end-to-end system, including the learning models and the optimization algorithms, for specific optimization tasks. This work will rely on techniques from online algorithms, stochastic and robust optimization, and learning theory, and build connections between these fields to address the central questions of algorithmic decision making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Internet of Nano Things promises to connect a new generation of sensors, transducers, data processors and communication devices for a smart and connected world.  A vital component of all nanodevices is transparent conductive films, generally made of silver nanowires.  Current manufacture of silver nanowires is costly as it involves multi-step batch production.  This award investigates a new approach for large-scale manufacture of silver nanowires with direct coupling with a three-dimensional printing system for patterning of transparent conducting films.  The reduced cost of transparent conducting films and print-on-demand silver nanowires hasten the adoption of devices for the Internet of Nano Things, which contributes to the U.S. economy and prosperity.  This research combines aspects of manufacturing, material science, nanotechnology, chemistry, and engineering.  Students actively participate in research thus achieving engineering expertise in advanced manufacturing, which is important to U.S. industry.  Undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from under-represented groups, are encouraged to participate in research and training.<br/><br/>This project studies the reaction conditions and mechanisms in a continuous reactor to produce silver nanowire (AgNW)-based conductive inks that can be continuously printed onto flexible substrates to create transparent conducting films (TCFs) for the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT).  The current batch production of AgNWs involves the costly steps of selective separation and concentration of the desired AgNWs.  In addition, AgNWs are prone to oxidation in harsh environments. This project studies a millifluidic system for the manufacture of monodispersed AgNWs with controllable length and aspect ratio and sufficient concentration for high performance TCFs.  The millifluidic reactor is connected to a 3D printer for continuous manufacture and printing of AgNW-based TCFs with a reduction in cost while maintaining high print quality.  In-situ monitoring of the millifluidic synthesis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy provides fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms.  Mechanistic knowledge of the chemical reactions helps to achieve control over the aspect ratio and yield of the AgNWs.  The AgNWs are modified using Pd nanoparticles via the galvanic replacement of Ag with Pd cations to achieve stability against oxidation. This research advances AgNW TCFs that are low cost, environmentally stable, with flexible/stretchable characteristics needed in applications such as IoNT devices with high potential for advancing the field of flexible electronics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Advanced Manufacturing Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communication issues have been broadly recognized as a critical factor that impacts design outcomes in team decisions, because the information shared during communication can be incomplete and imperfect. Therefore, addressing such issues by understanding the role of information uncertainty on human design decisions in teams could lead to better coordination of team decisions, advancement in human-AI collaborations, and significant cost savings in large-scale engineering design projects. However, despite the significant progress in modeling design decision-making in teams, current literature neglects two fundamental aspects of the design process: human designers have bounded rationality, and most design activities happen under competition, whether consciously or unconsciously. This project is motivated to fill this gap by developing theoretical and experimental constructs to computationally model human designers? sequential decisions in a competitive environment and to experimentally measure their bounded rationality. The expected outcome is a suite of new knowledge, including metrics, models, algorithms, and testbeds, on human behavior in design teams under competition in the presence of uncertainties. Broader impacts will be generated by directly engaging diverse undergraduate students in research activities through the Freshman Introduction to Research in Engineering (FIRE) program at the University of Texas at Austin and the Pinnacle and Clark Scholars programs at Stevens Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>This project is driven by answering two research questions: 1) what are the effects of information uncertainty (e.g., when design information shared between team members is incomplete) on design rationality under competition among teams? 2) How would such effects differ across a wider range of team sizes? To answer the two questions, an interdisciplinary research approach is planned that combines descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics. In particular, we will develop game theoretic models to model sequential design decisions under competition, synergistically integrating two types of sequential learning models, i.e., theory-driven prescriptive models (e.g., Bayesian optimization) and data-driven predictive models (e.g., long-short term memory units). The new approach explicitly models designers? perceptions of their opponents? past performance and predicts the opponent?s future decisions, thereby providing a quantitative way to study the influence of uncertain information shared among designers in a team on their decisions in competition against other teams. Experiments will be conducted to collect behavioral data to study how human irrationality, benchmarking on rational behaviors predicted by the theoretical models, would change over time during the course of the design competition. The research findings will be validated in a real-world design challenge on solar system design, where multiple teams compete for awards. To benefit a broader research community, this project will build an open design infrastructure to share the project data and findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projections of future ice loss rely on models that simulate the dynamic response of the ice sheet to climate changes. A key challenge is calibrating models based on observations made in the last few decades, in part because ice dynamics adjust to climate changes over long timescales. Past climate therefore affects the modern state. This project will use a numerical ice-sheet model and long-term climate data to simulate Greenland ice-sheet changes since 1850, with a specific focus on the ice-sheet?s dynamic ?memory? of climate over the past century. Ice loss concurrent with rapid warming is well documented in recent decades, but a period of rapid Arctic warming also occurred in the 1920s-1930s. Historical observations, where available, suggest that this triggered the retreat of many glaciers on the Greenland Ice Sheet, but their ongoing adjustment has not been thoroughly investigated. With simulations that fully encompass this period of early climate forcing, this project will provide further context for recent observations, and will provide insights that will aid in calibrating models for future projections. This project will also train two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The model simulations will encompass both the Greenland Ice Sheet as a whole, as well as case studies on several of its major outlet glaciers. Simulations will be forced with climate reanalysis products that extend over the industrial era, enabling a realistic treatment of short-term variability, including the rapid warming of the 1920s-1930s. The primary intended deliverable will be historical simulations that capture the major phases of mass loss suggested by long-term observations. Model output will be made publicly available to aid broader efforts to initialize simulations of future mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet. An additional deliverable will be a set of perturbed simulations designed to clarify leading physical controls on the glacier and ice-sheet evolution over this era. This will include assessing the relative impacts of climate variability and topographic boundary conditions, and the dynamic response that was committed by early-twentieth-century climate forcing. Together, the proposed model simulations will test theory and quantify the effects of early forcing, drawing new links between sparse glacier and climate observations from the pre-satellite era.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will advance our current understanding of the combined role of social and hydrological dynamics on post-hurricane recovery of freshwater resources on small sub-tropical islands. A group of U.S. students from diverse backgrounds will work closely with mentors and students from the University of the Bahamas, Grand Bahama Utility Company, the Bahamian Forestry Unit, and faculty from four US Universities (California State University, Sacramento, University of Wyoming, Oberlin College, and Rutgers University), comprising a diverse, interdisciplinary team of social scientists, hydrologists, soil scientists, and plant experts. Students will learn how to study local, global, and intercultural issues, understand and appreciate different perspectives, and interact with individuals from different cultures and backgrounds. The experiences gained through this international collaboration will be key to student's future success in an increasingly global economy, and will further the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce, able to address cross-cutting challenges in socio-hydrology. This project will also have a positive impact on students from the host Institution, gaining research experiences and training that they would otherwise not have access to. Beyond the impacts on students, local water management authorities will benefit from the generation of new data and modeling tools and the project will help inform local communities about climate and social challenges and their role on the sustainability and resilience of their water resources, which is anticipated to increase their involvement and level of adaptation to climate change mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>Despite the recognized importance of socio-hydrology in increasing our understanding of the interactions between water and human systems, interdisciplinary student training addressing the cross-cutting nature of socio-hydrology is not common. This project will investigate the importance of socio-hydrological dynamics on post-hurricane recovery of freshwater resources of small sub-tropical islands by collecting, integrating, and analyzing unique information on the social and hydrological processes that are identified as the main drivers of post-hurricane recovery of water resources in Grand Bahama. Our research will generate new data and knowledge on the relative importance and compound role of social and hydrological factors and will ultimately contribute to increased water resources sustainability and resilience of small islands under a changing climate. Students will participate in field campaigns to collect groundwater and soil salinity, groundwater levels and soil moisture data on various locations on the island. In addition, infiltration experiments will be conducted to assess salt build-up on the soil and its impact on the infiltration capacity of the soil. The above data will be used to improve the calibration and validation of an existing island scale model groundwater flow and salt transport modeling. This model will simulate FWL recovery under various recharge scenarios based on climatic projections. Soil salinity data will also be used to assess the loss in plant/forest biodiversity and changes in forest structure post-hurricane. Sociological investigations of community member?s perceptions on water management in Grand Bahama will also be conducted through focus groups and interviews. In addition to individual projects, the international research opportunity will culminate in an annual interdisciplinary research project that provides insights into the socio-hydrological dynamics of FWL recovery after storm induced salinization events. Students will present their research findings at an annual project Virtual Symposium, communicate their research beyond the program through outreach projects and scientific publications and gain important writing and presentation skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely recognized that current agricultural technologies, from crop genetic improvement to field crop production, will not meet future agricultural demands, due to their heavy reliance on expensive, time-consuming, trail and error field trials to develop improved plant breeds. Emerging mathematical optimization and machine learning methods for analyzing high-dimensional data provide opportunities to speed up plant breeding to achieve rapid and efficient adaptation of crops to changing environments. The approaches in this project will take advantage of engineering techniques that have been used to remarkably improve the efficiency and resiliency of communication, manufacturing, transportation and energy systems.  The research requires the synthesis of multiple disciplines, including agronomy, crop modeling, machine learning, operations research, optimization and plant breeding and aims to demonstrate the leadership role of engineering in addressing agricultural challenges.<br/><br/>Three technical issues, which represent a small but highly visible subset of agronomic systems, will be addressed: (1) accurately predicting plant phenotypes based on genetic, agronomic management and environmental data and their interactions; (2) design of genetic improvement systems to efficiently develop cultivars with superior phenotypes; and (3) design of crop management strategies to assure that crops achieve superior phenotypes under changing environments, while balancing reward, time, and risk in the decision-making process. The research team will first translate the technical issues into engineering objectives and then identify existing methods and design new ones to achieve the objectives. The corresponding engineering objectives are: (1) identify a small subset of variables associated with synergistic effects in addition to their additive effects; (2) design a set of algorithms for genomic selection, which is a special type of nonlinear, non-convex, high-dimensional, and dynamic optimization problem constrained by resource availability and laws of reproductive biology; and (3) create a set of multi-objective and multi-level optimization models and algorithms for balancing reward, time, and risk, subject to genetic, environmental, and logistical constraints.

For example, monolithic cloud applications are being replaced with graphs of smaller, simpler ?microservices? for reduced development complexity and increased code velocity. Further, such microservices are managed by cloud-native systems automatically, liberating cloud users from onerous operations of their in-cloud applications. Unfortunately, systems software that underpins cloud-native systems, such as virtualization, faces critical challenges to meeting the stringent needs of emerging microservices-based cloud applications, such as strong-yet-lightweight isolation, fast inter-microservice communication, and fine-grained elasticity control. This CAREER project proposes to conduct a holistic study of virtualization techniques to 1) identify critical bottlenecks in resource isolation, I/O communication, and service elasticity; 2) propose new system virtualization solutions to address these bottlenecks; and 3) validate the proposed solutions with real-world prototypes. The knowledge developed in this project will advance the key aspects of systems software in cloud-native systems, thus benefiting all cloud applications that are integral to society running on these systems. The research outcomes will have influences on the design and implementation of production cloud-native systems via university-enterprise collaborations and technology transfer and be integrated into core computer science courses. This project will provide training in the computer systems domain to graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students, via diverse outreach plans of summer camps, high school student/instructor mentorship, and the inclusion of underrepresented minority and women engineers.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of the CAREER project is to investigate and develop virtualization techniques for highly secure, efficient, and elastic cloud-native systems. First, the project will develop a strong-yet-lightweight isolation architecture for efficiently and securely sandboxing distributed microservices.

The proposed project has the potential to  protect against cyber harassment, privacy invasion, and prevent the dissemination of false information by identifying harmful or misleading audio and video deepfake content. It will have a significant impact in a number of areas, including the media, politics, business, and social networks, by maintaining the integrity of digital multimedia.

Surfaces often appear when we study the geometry of a system; for instance, the set of configurations of a mechanical system or the underlying template for a large dimensional data set. Braids occur whenever we have a collection of points moving in a surface, for instance stars and planets moving within our field of vision, or the roots of polynomials changing with respect to a parameter. In order to understand these phenomena, it is essential to study the set of symmetries of a surface, which is also known as the mapping class group of the surface. This is a  beautiful and rich theory that has been the focus of intense study over the past century. The goal of this research is to study surfaces, braids, and polynomials, and the interactions of these objects with each other. One project is to give fast algorithms for deciding basic properties of elements of the mapping class group. One of the properties that the algorithm computes is the entropy, which determines the amount of mixing happening on the surface. In addition to these research goals, the PI plans to continue work on several projects that have direct impact on graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The first is the highly successful Topology Students Workshop, a conference that serves both as a research conference in topology for graduate students as well as a professional development workshop. The second is a free, online, interactive textbook for basic linear algebra, called Interactive Linear Algebra. The PI also plans to expand outreach activities to local K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>The PI will study Thurston maps, braid groups, and mapping class groups. A Thurston map is a branched cover of the complex plane (or Riemann sphere) over itself, with finite post-critical set. Many polynomials are Thurston maps. A basic recognition problem in complex dynamics is: given a Thurston map, is it equivalent to a polynomial, and if so, which one? In prior work, the PI and his collaborators gave a new, geometric algorithm to solve this recognition problem. The PI plans to investigate new, structural descriptions of the universe of such recognition problems. Specifically, the project will establish a version of the Bestvina-Handel algorithm from the theory of mapping class groups that is adapted to the setting of Thurston maps. The project will also provide a version of the Birman exact sequence (again from the theory of mapping class groups). One project in the theory of mapping class groups is to give a quadratic time algorithm that takes as input a product of generators of the mapping class group  and determines the Nielsen-Thurston type of that product. This algorithm also produces finer information about the product of generators, such as reducing curves and entropy. A third project is to classify homomorphisms between braid groups. The main new tool is the theory of totally symmetric sets, developed by the PI and his collaborators. By classifying these homomorphisms we gain insight into the relationships between polynomials of different degrees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the scientific community is proposing millions of scientific software prototypes to enable reproducibility of research results in almost every domain. Scientists may frequently introduce security and quality issues into existing scientific software via their code changes due to their limited experience in software quality and security and the lack of tools for quality and security assessments that can be easily used and integrated in programming environments. Thus, several existing scientific software projects are difficult to 1) extend by scientists due to their poor quality and 2) deploy by industry due to the likelihood of security vulnerabilities and the bad development practices used. Without a unified and easy-to-integrate framework for detecting, fixing, and documenting vulnerability and quality issues in scientific projects, the reusability, extendibility, safe deployment, and technology transfer of scientific projects will remain limited. This project builds a sustainable, community-driven software security and quality analysis framework. These tools enable more scientists to build better software and to transfer their prototypes to industry by following the best software development practices. Its integrated education plan will bring undergraduate and graduate computer science students more awareness and expertise in the evolution of software systems, including security and quality issues.<br/><br/>This project develops a framework for detecting, fixing, and documenting security and quality issues. It will continuously monitor the software repository to identify security vulnerabilities and quality issues based on static and dynamic analyses, and then find the best sequence of code changes to prioritize and fix them. The developers can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the code changes that they want to apply. The framework includes a visualization support of the quality and security changes over the evolution of the project. Furthermore, non-expert programmers from the scientific community can use the automatically generated documentation by the framework to understand the severity of the detected issues and necessary code changes to fix them. The project has the potential to revolutionize how developers monitor the evolution of their systems in continuous integration environments by unifying security and quality issues detection and correction and enabling their automated documentation. All tools and methodologies will be empirically evaluated in collaboration with scientists from various domains.

Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, generally favor a brittle behavior, which reduces mechanical stability of the electronics, photonics, and energy storage devices built with them. Two-dimensional high entropy materials are expected to possess substantially better fracture toughness owing to a greater asymmetry at the atomic level. Thus, this project supports fundamental research to synthesize monolayer and multiplayer two-dimensional high entropy materials, conduct experiments in electron microscopes to visualize fracture, and theoretically reproduce the experimentally observed behaviors. Insights from this study will broaden the family of two-dimensional materials and advance the understanding of the effect of defects and other factors on their mechanical properties and behaviors. With higher fracture toughness, two-dimensional high entropy materials could potentially replace or be integrated with existing materials to produce high lifecycle nanoscale devices. As part of the project, an integrated research and education program will strive for societal impacts through classroom/online education, knowledge dissemination, engineering training, and outreach activities. Research opportunities will be afforded to both graduate and undergraduate students, specially underrepresented minority students. Outreach activities will target K-12 students and, uniquely, homeschoolers to motivate them towards STEM education. <br/><br/>Confined to two-dimensional geometry, cracks generally lead to brittle behavior with minimum plasticity at room temperature, which forms the basis of the dilemma of mutually exclusive fracture toughness and mechanical strength performance in bulk materials. This research aims to investigate asymmetrical fracture of two-dimensional high entropy materials, where bifurcations, branches, and deflections emerge due to asymmetric edge elastic properties at the crack tip and edge swapping during crack propagation, thus, significantly increasing the fracture resistance. Various two-dimensional high entropy materials will be synthesized via solid state reaction and chemical vapor deposition methods. In situ tensile tests in SEM and TEM will be conducted to visualize the deformation and fracture evolution amid various microstructural defects and features, such as the competing ternary and quaternary phases. A multiscale modeling framework based on DFT calculations, data-driven MD simulations, and phase field modeling will be used to simulate fracture behavior with focus on crack initiation and propagation. Ultimately, the project will advance the understanding of the effect of lattice distortion, defects, strain rate, and crack geometry as well as composition on the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional high entropy materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Earth's bow shock is a natural laboratory to study the complex interactions between the incident solar wind and the counter-streaming foreshock populations.

The sound system of a person's native language influences not only how second-language learners produce words but also how they recognize words, making it difficult for second-language learners to hear sound contrasts that do not distinguish words in the native language or that differ in how they distinguish words in the native and second languages. These difficulties can in turn impact second-language learners? ability to understand speech in their second language, thus causing important communication breakdowns, and they can exacerbate the degree of foreign accent that second-language learners typically evidence in speech production. This project seeks to clarify and explain the nature of this native-language influence by investigating a linguistic phenomenon that plays a critical role in spoken-word recognition across languages but has been under-investigated: lexical stress. <br/><br/>The project?s specific goals are threefold. First, the project will elucidate whether the cue-weighting theory of speech perception can provide a strong theoretical framework for understanding the listening difficulties that second-language learners encounter with lexical stress, and for developing training stimuli and methods to enhance the perceptual learning of lexical stress. Second, it will help resolve theoretical debates about the mechanisms underlying second-language perceptual learning, the nature and robustness of second-language perceptual representations, and the degree to which adult second-language perceptual learning remains malleable. Third, it will provide a theoretical foundation for the teaching of second-language speech perception, enabling instructors to tailor teaching practices according to students? native language and individual abilities, and the effectiveness of training stimuli and methods.

However, the limited computing and energy resources available at the edge device (e.g., mobile devices, sensors) stand at odds with the massive and growing cost of state-of-the-art machine learning training, posing a grand challenge for real-time machine learning (RTML) at the edge. This goal of this project is to foster a systematic breakthrough in achieving efficient online training of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in pervasive resource-constrained platforms and applications. An order of magnitude advance in RTML would enable numerous edge devices to proactively interpret and learn from new data, improve their own performance using what they have learned, and adapt to dynamic environments, all in real time. Success in this project will enable truly intelligent edge devices to penetrate all walks of life and thus generate significant impacts on societies and economies. This project will lead to new courses and open-education resources that can attract diverse groups of students and eventually deliver a platform for inclusion and innovation.  <br/><br/>The project addresses the RTML grand challenge using a three-pronged 'co-design' approach that seamlessly integrates algorithm, architecture, and circuit-level innovations. Specifically, at the algorithm level, an efficient training framework for RTML, for which trained models are also natively efficient for inference, will be established. Aggressive time and energy reductions can be achieved, at first by improving general training techniques, and then by focusing particularly on online learning and adaptation. At the architecture level, the project will first target reducing the high cost of data movement by trading it for lower-cost computation, and then generate optimal dataflows and hardware architectures to maximize the joint benefits of algorithms and hardware. At the circuit level, the project will leverage adaptive low-precision algorithms and architectures to design ultra-energy-efficient mixed-signal compute fabrics. Statistical computing techniques will be incorporated to demonstrate efficient, scalable, and robust machine learning chips. Finally, at the system level, an integration effort will be included to aid the realization of realistic system goals and to evaluate the innovations of the three core thrusts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such demands have dwarfed the capabilities of existing electronic hardware.  As CMOS technology approaches 1 nm node, it is obvious that the conventional technology scaling will soon run out of steam to meet the ever-growing demand of computing power.   To continue the Moore?s law, HfO2 based ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) is one of the leading candidates with benefits of combined nonvolatility, high energy efficiency, and compatibility with CMOS.  While many device-level developments have been performed on FeFET, one of the hindering factors is that the device?s development is often performed at small scale without high-level integration with CMOS technology, which is necessary to deliver a complete integrated-circuit (IC) solution for supporting the modern computing tasks.  To overcome the limitation of existing developments, this proposal will develop cross-layer techniques from device to circuit and architecture enabling large-scale integration of the highly promising FeFET device with standard CMOS technology. <br/><br/>This project will perform full-stack developments from device to architecture for the integration of CMOS and FeFET technology targeting emerging computing applications. Fabricated FeFET with CMOS at advanced technology nodes at a large scale will be used to demonstrate the proposed techniques. More specifically, we will perform the following developments.  At device level, improved process for integration between nFeFET, pFeFET and CMOS will be developed allowing better technology fusion of the FeFET and CMOS devices; At design methodology, a joint device-circuit collaborative design flow will be developed to tailor the FeFET technology towards the need of emerging computing applications such as AI; Furthermore, novel circuit and architecture utilizing FeFET as both memory and computing devices will be developed to exploit the features of FeFET and its co-existence with CMOS technology; Finally, demonstrations on complex processors and accelerators for emerging applications, with joint CMOS and FeFET technology will be delivered to showcase the benefits of the emerging device integrated with CMOS.  The integrative approach and demonstration of CMOS and FeFET fusion will manifest the system perspective of FeFET devices and establish a solid foundation for the future FeFET developments especially for the emerging computing tasks.  By integrating the advanced semiconductor technology with emerging computing tasks, the proposed projects provide strong educational materials and opportunities for students to learn the multi-disciplinary developments of modern computing techniques and microelectronic devices.  Both course materials and workshops on frontier semiconductor and computing techniques will be developed to provide solid training to the society while also promoting diversity and inclusion to college STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Films of bacterial aggregates, also called biofilms, are a ubiquitous form of microbial life. When they grow on solid-liquid interfaces, they can cause health problems like infections near joint implants. When biofilms grow at air-liquid interfaces, they can cause lung problems.

Contractile VSMCs regulate blood pressure in the artery by contracting or relaxing. However, they can revert into the synthetic type in response to an injury to the blood vessel. Synthetic VSMCs are responsible for synthesis of replacement cells and secretion of substances that are needed for vessel healing. This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) Relaunch project has hypothesizes that a third type of VSMCs exists, and the change in the cells to this third type is caused by stretch within the vascular tissue. It is further hypothesized that this change to the third type of VSMC happens through a signaling pathway known as Wnt.  Through this pathway, the VSMCs become bone-like cells and deposit mineral (calcium) into the arterial tissue that surrounds the cells, the extracellular matrix. The mechanical changes leading to this potential third phenotype are caused by hypertension, known as the silent killer. By understanding the signaling pathway associated with this change in the behavior of VSMCs, future research can be supported to develop targeted therapeutics to treat vascular calcification (i.e., hardening of the arteries) at the cellular and molecular level. This work could drive future research that will reduce the severity of heart disease complications experienced by patients and reduce the costs of treating high-risk patients. This project will also increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups in research -- in particular, first-generation, low-income students. <br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge by investigating the hypothesis that the continued plasticity of VSMCs to a third phenotype is caused by mechanical strain activating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. An in vitro vascular calcification model will be used to examine the role of mechanotransduction in VSMC phenotype changes. This project will: 1) investigate the activation of a Wnt signaling pathway in synthetic VSMCs; 2) examine the impact of surface mechanics on the activation of phenotypic modulation via the Wnt signaling pathway; and 3) examine the phenotypic modulation of VSMCs under mechanical strain.  This mechanical loading will mimic the physiological exposure of VSMCs to increased stretch due to hypertension, which is then hypothesized to cause a response within the tissue to increase its stiffness through calcification and return the range of strains to a tissue-specific homeostatic level.   This mechanical transduction response is known to occur in most biological tissues, including in bone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, there has been an outbreak of cotton Fusarium wilt caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov) in some southern U.S. states. This project aims to better understand the evolution and pathogenicity of F. oxysporum and to identify resistance genes that could help protect crops. The project will also provide opportunities for training and education in plant genomics and molecular biology for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach opportunities for underrepresented minorities and African scientists. By using cutting-edge technologies, this project will advance our understanding of F. oxysporum and its interactions with hosts, which could ultimately lead to more effective disease management strategies and increased crop production.<br/><br/>Over several years, the team has collected data on the pathogen characteristics and germplasm screens of a naturally infected cotton field in Texas. Based on this data, they have developed a hypothesis about the evolution and pathogenicity of F. oxysporum and gained molecular insights into the fungus-host interactions. They have also created platforms for transient and stable assays to study the loss and gain of function in cotton. The team aims to determine the genetic diversity, evolution, and pathogenicity of Fov and other F. oxysporum species and understand cotton's resistance mechanisms to Fusarium wilt through association genomics. The research will take a systems approach to understanding the co-evolutionary dynamics of pathogen virulence and host resistance in the complex genome of both the fungus and cotton. F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC) is a group of isolates with different host specificities, which are defined as formae speciales. FOSC has complex genome structures with core chromosomes and accessory chromosomes that may be associated with virulence and host specificity. The proposed research will explore the evolutionary dynamics of accessory chromosomes and their role in virulence and host specificity. The project will provide insights into Fov-cotton interactions and a broader understanding of F. oxysporum-host interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High levels of noise can have negative effects on animals, particularly those that communicate with sounds. Several studies have investigated how human-generated noise can impair the recognition of vocal communication signals. Interestingly, some studies have shown changes in signals produced by animals that live in cities that help them cope with the negative effects of noise. Whether and how the sense of hearing can change in response to human-generated noise is not known. Studying the iconic ?ribbit? of Pacific chorus frogs, this project explores precisely this. We will compare the calls and the hearing abilities of frogs that live in urban and rural regions across the San Francisco Bay Area. We will also study whether such changes in calls and hearing abilities allow animals to communicate easier in noisy environments. Further, we will explore whether changes in hearing among urban and rural populations are related to changes in the structure of the ear. These research activities will be complemented by educational activities, including research training of diverse student populations and science education outreach in local communities. As this project will further our understanding of the consequences of noise pollution for sensory perception and behavior, our results can inform conservation and urbanization efforts and promote progress in the design of communication devices that interact with humans.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic noise has dramatically increased over the past decades, becoming a major form of pollution. Accordingly, there is growing interest in understanding the effects of anthropogenic noise on animal behavior. For animals that communicate acoustically, anthropogenic noise can impair the detection and recognition of vocal signals. Several studies have investigated how vocal signals and signaling behaviors change to minimize the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise. In contrast, we do not know whether the hearing capabilities of urban animals also change to better cope with high levels of noise. The central hypothesis of this project is that, among populations with different levels of natural and anthropogenic noise, the auditory system varies in ways that facilitate signal reception. We will test this hypothesis using Pacific chorus frogs (Hyliola regilla) from populations with low and high levels of natural and anthropogenic noise. Specifically, we will (i) characterize the acoustic environment (soundscape) and vocal signals of populations with different levels of noise, (ii) determine how auditory processing abilities vary among soundscapes, (iii) determine how such variation in vocalizations and hearing abilities relate to acoustically-mediated mating behavior, and (iv) examine anatomical mechanisms underlying population-level variation in auditory processing abilities. By combining behavioral, physiological, and anatomical studies of auditory processing, this project will further our understanding of how novel environments shape sensation, perception, and animal communication systems in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Design activities for engineering systems across infrastructure, aerospace, and defense domains more closely resemble a collective decision-making process than centralized authority in traditional systems engineering practice. This topic is of interest because U.S. agencies and firms are actively architecting systems with decentralized decision authority, described variously as Internet 4.0, cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-things, or systems-of-systems across domains, including energy, transportation, manufacturing, and space systems. The design of these engineering systems differs from that of other systems because their large scale, long lifetime, and proximity to social systems evoke complex features such as adaptation, self-organization, and emergence, which take place over strategic timescales. A deeper understanding of how strategic dynamics impact designer interactions across theoretical and empirical perspectives can help to avoid costly overruns and cancellations by identifying and mitigating undesirable dynamics in conceptual design phases. Advances in systems engineering must develop theory, methods, and tools to coordinate and facilitate collective design activities. <br/><br/>This project builds on a line of economic methods applied to engineering design including utility theory, decision theory, social choice, and game theory. Collective systems design is modeled as a bi-level problem, where lower-level decisions correspond to an optimization problem and upper-level strategy decisions correspond to a coordination game. Normative models of agent behavior are based on classical and Bayesian game theory with utility functions incorporating behavioral factors such as risk attitudes. Multi-agent simulation studies evolution of strategies under repeated interaction among agents. Behavioral experiments collect empirical data about human decision-making for validation. The research will contribute new knowledge about how to characterize, study, and modify the strategic dynamics of engineering systems during conceptual design phases. The educational plan develops and delivers simulation activities to model systems problems by combining technical modeling and social interaction. The simulation activities behave as a highly abstracted model system to elicit rich strategic behaviors through face-to-face interaction, engage students with challenges of socio-technical problems, and retain computational tractability to teach analytical methods in educational contexts. Development and broad public dissemination of simulations in the context of Earth science space missions will expose a wide audience to strategic issues of government-commercial interdependency in space systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fluid forms can be bulk liquids, thin sheets, filaments, bubbles, foams, droplets, and aerosols, all of which exhibit mixed-dimensional geometric features, highly nonlinear evolution, and vastly contrasting scales.  Because these fluid manifestations constitute the diverse, complex, and in many cases invisible pathways for disease transmission in the physical world, the ability to simulate them with high fidelity, and the accessibility of these simulations to the public, would not only help families, schools, and small businesses solve their different problems but would also pave the way for fundamental advances in hygiene-related science. This research will develop the computational infrastructure to simulate fluid phenomena such as sneezing mucus, splash plumes, and hand-washing foam, which have been out of reach for visual and scientific computing due to their interleaving dynamic and geometric complexities. Project outcomes will have broad impact by making it possible to create novel scientific animations, educational illustrations, and interactive design tools, which jointly support an inclusive and accessible platform that allows scientists, engineers, healthcare professionals and STEM students to investigate these complex flow processes in highly individualized settings.<br/><br/>This research will advance the state of the art in computer graphics and scientific computing by establishing a novel set of computational methods to tackle flow phenomena that were previously understudied or intractable. These fluid systems consist of different substances such as mucus, saliva, or biosurfactants, that exhibit intricate geometries such as thin films, filaments, foam, and extremely small droplets, and that encompass multi-physics processes such as thin sheet fragmentation, vortex-capillary interaction, and fluid contact. The project aims to enable the accurate simulations of complex interfacial fluid phenomena characterized by these thin, dynamic, and non-manifold flow features on the mesoscopic length scale between 0.1 micrometer and 1 millimeter. At this intermediate length scale, fluids exhibit complicated flow dynamics and geometric forms due to the interaction between surface tension and other physical ingredients which are remarkably different from their macroscopic or microscopic counterparts (for instance, fluid can bounce, walk, glide, contact, or form non-manifold foam structures which are difficult for conventional approaches to simulate). The work will bridge this scientific gap by leading multifaceted efforts to develop novel geometric data structures, non-manifold interface tracking algorithms, structure-preserving PDE gauge formulations, multiphase coupling schemes and parallel numerical solvers, all of which will be integrated into a unified simulation framework to boost a broad range of hygiene-related applications centered around these flow processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This iron is supplied by dust that is carried from land out across the ocean by strong winds, or by volcanic activity deep within the ocean.  However, large areas of the ocean are very remote from both land and deep-sea volcanic activity, and the amount of iron that reaches these areas is quite small.  In these regions microscopic life is often limited by the very low concentrations of iron that characterize this environment.  To use iron, microbes must first extract it from seawater.  To do this, some microbes have the ability to manufacture unique organic compounds called siderophores that are specifically designed to capture iron from seawater and transport it into the cell.  The presence of siderophores in seawater acts as a signal to know where in the ocean iron may be limiting microbial productivity.<br/><br/>US GEOTRACES program is a cooperative, multi-investigator effort to make high quality, high-resolution measurements of metal concentrations across representative sections of major ocean basins.  GEOTRACES data will serve as a benchmark against which future measurements, made as the ocean responds to climate change, can be referenced.  Most biologically important metals in the ocean are bound to organic compounds such as siderophores, and the goals of our project are to identity and measure these metal-organic complexes at the molecular level on a section across the South Pacific and Southern Oceans between Tahiti and Antarctica.  The section will consist of ~ 30 evenly spaced sites where samples of seawater will be collected from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.  Trace-metal organic complexes will be extracted from these samples and analyzed in the laboratory for iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, manganese, and iodine containing complexes.  The molecular identities, concentrations and water column distributions of these complexes will be determined and used to assess how microbes acquire and use trace metals and other nutrients.  In parallel, select samples will also be collected and analyzed for microbial genomes to provide information on which classes of microbes manufacture and use siderophores to acquire iron.  Data will be archived in national and international databases.  The project activities will help train the next generation of marine scientists and inform the public about how science can inform us about the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Until recently, bacteria were considered the main degraders of organic matter, while non-bacterial consumers? role in carbon cycling was largely been ignored.  However, eukaryotes such as fungi exhibit distinct metabolic capacities and responses to environmental variables, suggesting global change may alter the balance of microbial activities in the oceans and potentially alter the fate of marine carbon.  Here, researchers integrate field data with modeling and laboratory experiments with representative cultures to identify microbes? functional roles in marine organic matter degradation and to determine their response to changing environmental conditions.  This project will open new windows into the diversity of microbial metabolisms and how these dynamics will shift with global change driven increases in temperature and other environmental factors. Additionally, this projects builds a new scientific research team and expands scientific training at levels ranging from K-5 teachers, to undergraduate and PhD students.<br/> <br/><br/>This project will leverage a decade-long, coastal microbial time series, the Piver?s Island Coastal Observatory (PICO), to examine how diverse heterotrophic microbial communities (bacteria, phytoplankton, fungi and Labyrinthulomycetes protists) metabolize carbon compounds under different thermal regimes. This project will develop a model microbial consortium that has the potential to transform perception of carbon cycling in coastal systems by integrating functional, organismal-interaction and environment-dependent responses into a modeling framework. Empirical Dynamic Modeling will identify drivers of the observed dynamics, differentiate causation from correlation, infer effects of possibly unobserved variables (e.g. predation), and quantify interactions between organisms. This data will further be used to develop a culturable model consortium whose members metabolize distinct components of phytoplankton-derived organic matter. To test both model predictions and how well the consortium represents complex microbiomes, both the model consortium and a ?wild? coastal seawater microbiome will be assayed for changes in function (phytoplankton DOM degradation) as temperatures increase (+4 °C). These experiments will compare outcomes for individual isolates, the consortium, and a wild coastal microbiome in composition/abundance, gene expression and degradation of specific compounds. Finally, experimental results will be used to parameterize and refine an Ensemble Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics model that can predict the fate and transformation of carbon in marine systems under varying climate scenarios. While this research leverages existing expertise in marine microbiomes, this model consortium approach can be applied to diverse systems to answer questions about environmental filtering, organismal interactions and functional diversity critical to predicting ecosystem-level responses to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DDoS attacks have increased in sophistication with advanced strategies to continuously adapt (e.g., changing threat postures dynamically) and induce collateral damage (i.e., higher latency and loss for legitimate traffic). Furthermore, advanced attacks may also employ reconnaissance (e.g., mapping the network to find bottleneck links) to target the network infrastructure itself. In light of these trends, state-of-art defenses (e.g., advanced scrubbing, emerging software-defined defenses, and programmable switching hardware) have fundamental shortcomings. This project will develop a new framework, referred to as ""Optics-enabled In-Network defenSe for Extreme Terabit DDoS attacks"" (ONSET). The framework makes a case for new dimensions of defense agility that can programmatically control the topology of the network (in addition to the processing behavior) to tackle advanced and future attacks. The project will facilitate the use of optical technologies as an exciting visual medium for engaging K-12 students via suitable channels for dissemination. The project will also result in new course materials at the intersection of optical networking, software-defined networking, and network security to enable students to become domain experts in this emerging problem space. <br/><br/>The project will take an interdisciplinary approach spanning security, optics, systems, and networks, to address fundamental challenges along three thrusts: (1) novel ""data plane"" solutions to rapidly reconfigure the wavelengths and switches and new capabilities in programmable switches to rapidly identify malicious vs. benign traffic at line rate; (2) novel ""control plane"" orchestration mechanisms for scalable resource management algorithms and coordinated control across optical networking and programmable switches; and (3) new ""northbound application programming interfaces (APIs)"" to express novel defenses to combat current and future DDoS attacks (e.g., with reconnaissance).

Monitoring technologies, such as the proposed frailty score, have the potential to improve older people?s safety, manage their health and assist them in maintaining their independence. Additionally, these technologies hold the promise of enormous cost savings for the healthcare system by enhancing the ability of providers to provide timely intervention prior to a patient?s deterioration requiring acute care.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel objective sensor-based frailty assessment tool. In this frailty tool, for the first time, instead of assessing characteristics of physiological systems in basal resting-state conditions, a provocative physical stress test will be employed to quantify the level of physiological reserve within and across cardiac and motor systems. Biomechanics approaches including muscle model and heart rate dynamics analysis will be used to characterize motor and cardiac system behaviors. In addition, the proposed technology may be used to assess dynamic interactions between the motor and cardiac systems using state space reconstruction of motor and heart rate behaviors within the stress-response model. The test takes 60 seconds to perform (repetitive and fast elbow flexion) and can provide the frailty score immediately after the test. The proposed approach has been validated cross-sectionally using comprehensive frailty assessment approaches that take 45-60 minutes and longitudinally based on adverse hospital/treatment outcomes, readmission, and mortality.

The East African Rift is among the best places to study the influences of Earth processes on the evolution of mammals. Here the region?s geologic and climate histories, including the formation of the rift system that is the cradle of humankind, are preserved in sedimentary rocks in a unique way. The team will investigate these sediments, and the fossils they contain, to gain insight into ancient climate and habitats that record the emergence of humans, their primate ancestors, and African mammals over the last 25 million years. Our research will explore relationships between tectonics, climate, and mammal evolution in the Turkana Basin, Kenya using integrated field, laboratory, and modeling studies. New and existing data will be combined to study the links between rift development, climate change, and their respective roles in vegetation and mammal evolution. The team will produce a tectonic model that reconstructs rift evolution in this region of East Africa for the past 25 million years, and the tectonic model will be integrated with climate-vegetation models of equal or better resolution. Independent geological, geochemical, paleoecological, and paleontological data will be used to validate these model outputs to distinguish the influences of tectonics and climate on the evolution of Turkana ecosystems and mammals. The project will also train several postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and provide them with the opportunity to conduct field work in Kenya.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to test multiple hypotheses centered on questions regarding the complex interplay of tectonics and climate on the evolution of mammals and late Cenozoic terrestrial ecosystems.

While the effect of tile drainage on streamflow and water quality has been studied in individual watersheds, this project will assess how tile drainage alters streamflow at large spatial scales to make broader conclusions and recommendations to stakeholders. In addition, the impacts of tile drainage on water temperature regimes are largely unknown. Changes in water temperature in streams are particularly important, as they influence biological activity, gas solubility, and water evaporation rates. Using a large-scale network of streamflow and water-temperature observations in conjunction with an array of geospatial information (e.g., tile drainage, land use, climate data), this work will examine the effects of tile drainage on streamflow and water temperature at the scale of the entire agricultural Upper Midwest using statistical models. Throughout the project, stakeholders will be interviewed pre- and post-statistical modeling to ensure that the project results in actionable outcomes. The work will also provide valuable research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students. Workshops will be conducted that provide hands-on experience of the methods and approaches to be used in this project. Results will be disseminated in manuscripts, conference presentations, news releases, and public data portals.<br/><br/>This research will develop quantile regression models at the scale of the entire agricultural portion of the Mississippi River Basin and at local watershed levels to provide better insight into the mechanisms that drive seasonal variations of sub-daily and daily streamflows and water temperatures. The use of quantile regression models will allow for the full distribution of streamflows and water temperatures to be examined. The stakeholder engagement throughout the modeling process will shape model results and output displays to user groups? interests, extending model salience and utility to other groups. The results will improve the understanding of how tile drainage has altered local and regional hydrology and water temperature, thereby providing additional insight into major Midwestern concerns such as water quality, flooding, and drought effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly one in five children experience an internalizing disorder like anxiety or depression. These disorders can hinder development well into adulthood. Yet objective and widely available assessment for these conditions remains a key unmet need. Such an assessment could enable effective diagnosis at scale while advancing the understanding of internalizing disorders, potentially informing future personalized interventions. The results of this project pave the way for improved assessment of a variety of disorders such as fall risk assessment in older adults and in individuals with neurological disorders. This project will also establish a digital mental health interest group at the University of Vermont that will bring together high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students with faculty and industry professionals. This group will engage in an annual digital mental health hackathon, hosted by UVM?s Center for Biomedical Innovation, that focuses on rural mental healthcare.<br/><br/>This NSF CAREER project advances the fields of childhood mental health, digital medicine, and the engineering of signal processing and machine learning algorithms for extracting meaning from wearable sensor signals. These advances fill key knowledge gaps, and will be made in the context of three research objectives: 1) developing and validating context-aware multi-modal digital biomarkers and using them to identify transdiagnostic latent classes, 2) developing, validating, and optimizing multi-modal, multi-domain digital phenotypes of childhood internalizing disorders, and 3) developing an open-source platform that integrates algorithms for extracting biomarkers, latent classes, and phenotypes from wearable and mobile technologies. Data to inform this project will be collected from children at elevated risk for internalizing disorders. Each child will complete a series of brief mood induction tasks during which movement, speech, electromyography, electrodermal activity, and electrocardiography data will be collected by wearables and mobile phones. These research objectives advance scientific knowledge of the biomarkers and phenotypes of childhood internalizing disorders, trans-diagnostic latent profiles in young children, and the relationship between physiological markers of these conditions and their behavioral symptoms. The first-of-its-kind platform will advance development and validation efforts in digital medicine and allow future extension to a wide array of clinical endpoints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantification of cancer evolutionary dynamics is therefore essential to understanding the mechanisms of cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing has enabled characterization of tumor composition at the finest possible resolution, thus providing researchers with the data needed to potentially allow for such quantification. However, to realize this potential, appropriate algorithms and data analysis tools are needed. The computational discipline that extracts evolutionary parameters from genomic data by integrating phylogenetics, population genetics and statistical learning is called phylodynamics. While almost all existing phylodynamics methods are developed for viruses, there is a growing realization that this methodology is also highly relevant to cancer biology. However, the development of cancer phylodynamics algorithms faces many challenges associated with the nature of cancer genomics data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing a phylodynamic framework for joint inference of cancer phylogenetic trees and evolutionary parameters from single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-Seq) data. This framework will allow cancer researchers to carry out a statistically and computationally sound evaluation of the effects of particular genome alterations or their combinations. In addition, this project will support development of innovative cross-disciplinary curricula, and bioinformatics training for diverse cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia State University (Title III designation of Predominantly Black Institution), University of Connecticut, and UConn Health.<br/><br/><br/>The project has three interrelated technical aims. First, investigators will develop algorithms for joint reconstruction of clonal frequencies and phased cancer clone genomic profiles (including copy number variation profiles and single nucleotide variants). The project will concentrate on low-coverage scDNA-seq that can  provide enough clonal data to guarantee the density of branching events in the cancer  phylogenies necessary for phylodynamics analysis. Second, the researchers will design a novel methodology for intra-tumor phylodynamics inference. This includes scalable construction of plausible clone phylogenetic trees  using a novel bipartition-based median-tree approach, together with maximum a posteriori inference of cancer fitness and mutability landscapes. The distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is the use of convex optimization techniques rather than MCMC sampling, which will guarantee scalability and accuracy of developed computational tools. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments will be conducted to validate and assess the accuracy of developed methods.  These will include computational experiments on simulated and publicly available scDNA-Seq data, as well as using scDNA-Seq datasets generated by in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted at UConn Health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although pervasive, out-sourced ML processing poses real threats to personal or business providers' data privacy. For example, the clients either need to share their sensitive data, such as healthcare records, financial information, with the server, or the server has to disclose the model to the clients. To guarantee privacy, the rise of cryptographic protocols, such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), enable ML analytics directly on the encrypted data. While enticing, there still exists a big gap between the theory and practice, e.g., long latency due to the prohibitively expensive computation or communication overhead over ciphertext. This project aims to practically accelerate the private ML service by offering a full-fledged development of efficient, scalable and encryption-conscious computing paradigms. The project's novelties lie in new ML-specific cryptographic operators, accuracy-preserving and crypto-friendly neural architectures, and pioneered algorithm-hardware co-design methodologies. The project's broader significance and importance are: (1) to advance trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), one of the national strategic pillars of the National AI Initiative; (2) to deepen the understanding of interactions among cryptography, machine learning and hardware acceleration; (3) to enrich the computer engineering curriculum, and the training of students from diverse backgrounds through relevant programs at Lehigh University, Northeastern University, and the University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>The project will develop a multifaceted design paradigm for efficient, scalable and practical algorithm-hardware co-optimized solutions to significantly accelerate privacy-preserving machine learning on hardware platforms such as FPGA. This project consists of three intervening research thrusts: (1) to orchestrate information representation and model sparsity in the encryption domain to fundamentally decrease the memory and computation footprint in the HE inference; (2) to overcome the ultra-high overhead associated with the MPC-based solution through techniques such as encryption-aware model truncation and partial hardware reconfiguration; (3) to search for crypto-friendly and accuracy-preserving neural architectures via jointly optimizing non-linear operation reduction, and closed loop ""algorithm-hardware"" design space exploration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This presents a powerful and flexible means of learning about the world that does not involve explicit instruction that appears to play an important role in spoken language learning. However, not all patterns can be learned by passive exposure alone. This research project investigates how learning across patterns of experience proceeds when passive exposure is insufficient to drive learning and yet there is no explicit instruction. The prior work that this project builds on suggests that real-world statistical learning may capitalize on input regularities? global temporal alignment with behaviorally-relevant actions and events to hasten learning. Learning across statistical regularities can be incidental, and not overtly driven by an intention to learn, while still taking place in the context of an active task that generates valuable predictions and rewarding outcomes. This perspective may be transformative in how we think about human learning of statistically-structured input in complex, naturalistic environments.  Findings from this research will inform the design of  learning interventions that capitalize on these learning principles to be useful for diverse communities of learners. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance a new research approach, empirical tests of mechanistic predictions, and complementary information from behavior, electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging to understand statistical learning under more natural circumstances involving interplay among active behavior, multimodal input, selective attention, and statistical input regularities. It pursues the twin hypotheses that (1) active engagement in a rich, environment can support statistical learning by virtue of loose temporal alignment of statistically-structured input with behaviorally-relevant actions, objects, and events and (2) that this incidental statistical learning drives the emergence of selective attention to behaviorally relevant regularities, creating a virtuous cycle that promotes later learning.

Humans and animals must prioritize, select, and sustain attention to relevant sounds ? and potentially suppress irrelevant sounds ? to guide decisions and actions. This selective attention guides our ability to listen, and is crucial to everyday behavior, especially in noisy environments, and its breakdown greatly impacts quality of life for many listeners, particularly as we age. Yet, despite being a fundamental human ability, we know relatively little about the cognitive and neurobiological basis of auditory selective attention. A better understanding of selective attention will have broad societal impact by guiding improvements to machine listening and next-generation hearing aids. This transatlantic partnership will also develop multiple educational outreach programs that include the creation of videos about cognitive neuroscience and the importance of auditory attention in hearing. These videos will be widely disseminated and linked to NSF?s Classroom Resources and the UK?s BBSRC Schools and Young People sites.  <br/><br/>This binational, collaborative project links five laboratories from the United States and the United Kingdom to undertake cross-cutting behavioral and neurobiological research on auditory selective attention. The project capitalizes on interactions between learning and attention: when sounds occur frequently, listeners detect them more readily in noise and respond to them more quickly in decision making. This suggests that the rich patterns of sensory signals structuring the natural world may help to direct attention. The project will include studies of auditory attention in humans and also in an animal model (the ferret - whose audiogram and hearing is very similar to humans). The project unifies cross-species approaches with a pair of simple auditory tasks (duration detection and interval detection across a range of spectral  frequencies), each of which provides unique opportunities to understand how input regularities in acoustic stimulus statistics direct attention to specific sounds or qualities of sounds. A novel aspect of this research is that parallel studies, using an array of complementary neurobiological techniques, will provide measurements over multiple levels of analysis from single neurons to whole brain activity, that will be integrated into a comprehensive picture of selective auditory attention. The project will use electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), high-density electrophysiology, and intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients, to test competing hypotheses about how the brain?s cortical response to sound is shaped by acoustic context and experience. This research is likely to lead to new insights and advances in our understanding of the neural basis of auditory selective attention, which is crucial for hearing.<br/><br/>This proposal is awarded under the SBE-UKRI Lead Agency Opportunity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sexual violence is a serious public health problem in the United States: every 68 seconds an American is sexually assaulted. Online-to-offline sexual violence refers to nonconsensual sexual acts that occur via the combination of computer-mediated and face-to-face communication. The ways in which Americans discover and interact with potential sexual partners are increasingly computer-mediated, however we have little understanding of how computer-mediated communication influences perceptions of appropriate sexual behavior, which may predispose individuals to becoming perpetrators or victims of sexual harm without their realization. The knowledge produced through this project will benefit public health and constitute crucial advances in multiple intersecting fields such as human computer interaction, nursing, and psychology via informing entirely new solutions to online-to-offline sexual violence that are truly preventative and do not rely on conscious intent by the perpetrator to cause harm, or recognition by victims that harm is occurring. <br/><br/>The research uses a mixed methods, longitudinal approach to studying online-to-offline sexual activity through online dating, a well known context for sexual violence.

This will comprise instances of online daters' behavior across online and offline interaction as it relates to sexual activity such as consent practices, as well as the impacts of such behavior on key psychological constructs. Data collection will be made more scalable and privacy-preserving with a data donation app embodying best practices for sexual experience reporting.

At the same time, novel two-dimensional materials and polymer derived high temperature ceramics have captured the attention of the materials community. In this research project, two dimensional MXene will be incorporated into a silicon oxycarbide matrix to generate new materials, both on Earth and at the International Space Station. The high temperature evolution behaviors of two-dimensional materials and polymer to ceramic conversion under microgravity conditions will be systematically compared with the processes on Earth. These materials are expected to have high oxidation resistance, excellent electrical conductivity, and low density. They should also have great synergistic potentials for toughness, strength, and high temperature stability. The composites can be made into almost any shape (bulk, coating, discrete feature, et cetera) and size (nano- to macro-) based on application needs. In addition, these materials can easily produce complex shape, thin-wall, or freeform components with lightweight and functional capabilities in high temperature environments. This research will usher in a new generation of advanced materials which have great potential to be used  as heat exchangers, electric systems, catalyst support, energy storage, electrodes, nano-devices, and microsystems. Ultimately, project results will lead to new applications benefiting space science and life on Earth.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research project. The PI will expand current activities to Eastern Virginia while continuing efforts with different summer camps on campus. In addition, the PI will expand outreach efforts to the Western Virginia Science Museum to stimulate the interest of females and minorities in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This research project will advance understanding of atomic- and nano-level species interactions under different gravitational conditions in order to explore a new class of high temperature stable and electrically conductive materials. The high temperature composites will include both dense and porous microstructures but the methodology developed will be applicable to a wide range of high temperature materials derived from 2D additives and polymer precursors. This research project is expected to develop new theories, provide new knowledge, and offer novel methods in   atomic level design and thermodynamic prediction of polymer derived ceramics. Results from this project will open new opportunities for  using microgravity to understand and create novel high temperature materials. The team will conduct the research using four approaches. First, using MXene exfoliation and surface functionalization, pre-pyrolysis at 500-700°C will be conducted in order to provide controlled states for microgravity and Earth gravity studies. Second, different atmosphere pyrolysis will be conducted on Earth and under microgravity to understand the atmosphere and gas release effects on new phase formation. Third, theoretical thermodynamic calculation and experimental pyrolysis studies will be combined in order to explore the fundamental interfacial interaction and phase evolution processes. Finally, gravitational effects on 2D MXene deformation, stacking, and chemical interaction with silicon oxycarbide during pyrolysis will be comprehensively investigated; the phase and structural evolution of the porous systems will be correlated with pore stability and shrinkage/collapse under different gravity conditions. The educational component is training of multiple graduate and undergraduate students, with a focus on women and minorities.
